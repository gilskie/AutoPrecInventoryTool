<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF ADRIAN SERPA (sworn October 23, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, Adrian Serpa, of the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY</P>
<P>1. I am an Associate with the law firm of Bell Temple LLP, lawyers for the Applicant, and as such have knowledge of the matters to which I hereinafter depose. Where such knowledge is based upon information and belief, I have identified the source thereof and verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>BACKGROUND</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. On November 17, 2013, Stephen Peter Novak injured himself when he fell off a ladder during a band practice at the premises of an engineering firm, Lakeland Engineering (&ldquo;Lakeland&rdquo;). Lakeland occupies a building owned by 1062220 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>3. At all material times, Sanjay Patel (&ldquo;Patel&rdquo;) was the principal and / or owner of both Lakeland and 1062220 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>4. On January 8, 2015, Novak issued a claim as against Patel, Lakeland and 106220 Ontario Inc. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the Statement of Claim bearing Court File No. CV-15-519329, issued January 8, 2015.</P>
<P>5. There were three insurers potentially liable to indemnify Patel in relation to any damages paid on settlement for the aforementioned incident:
<P1>a. the Applicant, insurer of Lakeland, through CGL coverage available to Patel as a principal of Lakeland. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the subject RSA policy;</P1>
<P1>b. Aviva Insurance (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;), insurer of 1062220 Ontario Inc., through CGL coverage available to Patel as its principal. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the Aviva policy; and</P1>
<P1>c. and Intact Insurance (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;), through a personal homeowner's policy held by Patel in his personal capacity. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the Intact policy.</P1></P>
<P>6. I verily believe that Intact ultimately declined to extend a defence and / or indemnity to Patel under the subject homeowner's policy.</P>
<P>7. Aviva and RSA ultimately agreed to defend Patel in his personal capacity and shared in the costs for same. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the Statement of Defence and Crossclaim of Lakeland, filed on June 2, 2015. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the Statement of Defence and Crossclaim of Patel, filed on July 22, 2015. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the <UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Statement of Defence and Crossclaim of 106220 Ontario Inc., filed January 11, 2016.</P>
<P>8. On January 20, 2016, Patel, by way of Royal and Sun Alliance, brought an application to compel Intact to provide him a defence. After review the &ldquo;Other Insurance&rdquo; clause in the subject Royal and Sun Alliance and Intact insurance policies, the application judge held that Intact had no duty to defend as it was an excesses insurer. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the decision of Justice Mew in <CASEREF><SOC>Patel v. Intact Financial Corporation</SOC></CASEREF>, heard January 20, 2016.</P>
<P>9. The Novak action settled at mediation on February 28, 2017 for an all-inclusive payment of $380,000 (&ldquo;Settlement&rdquo;). The total settlement was split 1/3 ($126,666.66) as between Lakeland, 106220 Ontario Inc. and Patel in his personal capacity. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit are the Minutes and Settlement mid Full and Final Release, dated February 28, 2017.</P>
<P>10. Subsequent to the Settlement, Aviva brought its own application to compel Intact to contribute to costs incurred in defending and settling the claim as against Patel in his personal capacity.</P>
<P>11. The application was heard by Justice Kristjanson on June 7, 2018. In the decision it was noted that the &ldquo;Other Insurance&rdquo; language of the Aviva policy is identical to the RSA policy considered in the previous application. While Intact argued that the Aviva application was <EM>res judicata</EM> and / or an abuse of process, given the previous unsuccessful application of Royal and Sun Alliance, Justice Kristjanson noted at paragraph 29 that the issue of the duty of Intact to <EM>indemnify</EM> had never been addressed. Her Honour went on to decide the issue and ordered Intact to reimburse Aviva for its proportionate share of the settlement and associated defence costs. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of the decision of Justice Kristjanson in <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC></CASEREF>, heard June 7, 2017.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>RELIEF SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. I verily believe that Intact should be compelled to contribute to its proportionate share of the above-noted settlement.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF MOTION</TI>
<P>1. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company (&ldquo;RSA&rdquo;) makes this application to compel Intact Financial Corporation (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;) to contribute to the amounts paid to settle the personal liability claim against their mutual insured Sanjay Patel. Mr. Patel was sued by his friend, Stephen Novak, for injuries Mr. Novak suffered while attending a &ldquo;jam session&rdquo; hosted by Mr. Patel after work hours in a commercial unit occupied by Mr. Patel's engineering firm, Lakeland Engineering (the &ldquo;Underlying Action&rdquo;). The building was also owned by Mr. Patel through an Ontario numbered company.</P>
<P>2. RSA provided liability insurance for Lakeland Engineering. Aviva provided liability insurance for the building. Intact provided homeowner's liability insurance to Mr. Patel personally. Based on the allegations in the Statement of Claim, all three policies were exposed to the potential of indemnity in the Novak action, depending on the capacity in which Mr. Patel was held liable to Mr. Novak. The three liability policies insured entirely separate risks, and did not overlap. While RSA and Aviva met their contractual obligations and defended and indemnified Mr. Patel, Intact, in violation of its contractual obligations, refused.</P>
<P>3. As the Intact policy had a duty to indemnify, and was plainly exposed to liability, RSA is entitled to recover Intact's share of settling the Underlying Action. Based on equitable principles, these amounts should be divided evenly between the insurers.</P>
<P>4. RSA previously pursued an application before Justice Mew seeking a contribution to defence costs from Intact. Justice Mew held that, while Intact's policy was triggered, it did not need to contribute to defence costs, as the Intact policy provided excess coverage only. In reaching that conclusion, Justice Mew was not referred to, and did not consider, the Supreme Court of Canada's test in <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp v. Lombard</SOC></CASEREF>, which establishes the test for overlapping insurance coverage. As a result, Justice Mew was misdirected, and his decision is not supported at law.</P>
<P>5. Intact will presumably argue that RSA is estopped from bringing the within application on the basis of Justice Mew's decision. RSA accepts that the issue of RSA pursuing Intact for its proportionate share of the defence costs incurred by RSA in defending Mr. Patel in his personal capacity has been decided between the two parties. However, RSA submits that the issue of RSA pursuing Intact for its the proportionate share of the <UNDER>settlement of the Underlying Action</UNDER> paid by RSA has not been decided. The duty to indemnify was not, and could not, have been considered by Justice Mew.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Relevant Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. RSA, Intact, and Aviva are all insurance companies licenced in Ontario.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 2, para. 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Mr. Patel is an engineer and principal of Lakeland Engineering (&ldquo;Lakeland&rdquo;). Lakeland occupied Unit #1 of an industrial building located at 1100 Sutton Drive, in Burlington, Ontario (the &ldquo;Premises&rdquo;). The building is owned by 1062220 Ontario Inc. (&ldquo;1062220&rdquo;), a company owned by Mr. Patel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 1, paras. 2-3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Insurance Coverage</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. RSA issued a commercial insurance policy to Lakeland which included liability insurance coverage for Lakeland's engineering operations. The RSA policy covered Mr. Patel as a principal of Lakeland but only while he was acting in a corporate capacity for Lakeland.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 2, para. 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Aviva issued a commercial insurance policy to 1062220 which included liability insurance coverage for its operation of the building. The Aviva policy covered Mr. Patel as a principal of 1062220 but only while he was acting in a corporate capacity for 1062220.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg, 2, para. 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Intact issued a homeowner's insurance policy to Mr. Patel for his residence at [location omitted] The Intact policy covered Mr. Patel's <UNDER>personal</UNDER> liability, specifically excluding coverage for business pursuits, and accordingly, excluding any liability exposure of Mr. Patel in his role as a principal of either 1062220 or Lakeland.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 2, para. 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Underlying Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. On November 17, 2013, as he did on a weekly basis, Mr. Patel hosted a &ldquo;jam session&rdquo; for his friends at the Premises, outside of business hours. The attendees included his close friend, Mr. Novak. While Mr. Patel was using a ladder to show Mr. Novak a mezzanine being constructed in the unit, Mr. Novak fell off the ladder and was seriously injured.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pgs. 1-2, paras. 1&ndash;4</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Mr. Novak issued a Statement of Claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice naming as Defendants, Mr. Patel, Lakeland, and 1062220. The allegations against Mr. Patel do not distinguish between the various capacities in which Mr. Patel was acting at the time of the loss. Mr. Patel was potentially liable in his capacity as a principal of the building's owner/manager of 1062220, or in his capacity as a principal of the occupier Lakeland. Mr. Patel was also exposed to personal liability, given that the events which brought Mr. Novak (a non-business associate of Mr. Patel's) to the Premises involved a private jam session unrelated to Mr. Patel's businesses.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa; Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pgs. 2, paras. 1&ndash;7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. The Underlying Action was tendered by Mr. Patel to each of Intact, Aviva, and RSA seeking coverage. Aviva and RSA acknowledged a duty to defend Mr. Patel under their respective policies. In spite of its policy having been triggered by the personal allegations against Mr. Patel, Intact refused to defend Mr. Patel. This refusal to acknowledge that the Intact policy was required to respond represented a &ldquo;blatant breach of contract&rdquo; by Intact, according to the reasons of Justice Mew, as discussed further below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 2, paras. 5-6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. RSA and Aviva each appointed defence counsel on behalf of their respective insureds 1062220 and Lakeland. Though they recognized a duty to defend Mr. Patel in his capacity as a principal of their named insured corporations, both Aviva and RSA reserved their rights in the event Mr. Patel was held liable in his personal capacity. Recognizing the potential conflict based on these reserved rights, Aviva and RSA retained and co-funded independent defence counsel for Mr. Patel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 2, para. 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>RSA's Duty to Defend Application Before Justice Mew</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. RSA brought a coverage application before Justice Mew compelling Intact to pay its proportionate share of RSA's defence costs being incurred in defending Mr. Patel. Justice Mew released his reasons on January 20, 2016.</P>
<P>16. Justice Mew held that the Intact policy was triggered by the allegations in the Statement of Claim, based on a potential finding that Mr. Patel was acting in a personal capacity at the time of the loss. Justice Mew then, without explanation, proceeded to compare the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the RSA and Intact policies, concluding that effect should be given to the Intact policy's stated intention to provide excess coverage only where other homeowners' liability insurance was available.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2 pg. 8, para. 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. However, Justice Mew was not referred to, and therefore did not consider, the leading Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 48</CITE></CASEREF>, which establishes the test for determining when insurance policies are overlapping, a necessary pre-condition to consideration of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses. Had Justice Mew been referred to <EM>Family Insurance</EM>, it is respectfully suggested that he would have determined that the <EM>Family Insurance</EM> test was <UNDER>not</UNDER> met, as the RSA and Intact policies do not insure the same subject matter. As such, consideration of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses by him was improper. The RSA policy insured Mr. Patel in his capacity as an officer of Lakeland, expressly <UNDER>excluding</UNDER> coverage for his personal liability. The Intact policy covered Mr. Patel's personal liability, <UNDER>expressly</UNDER> excluding coverage for any business pursuits of Mr. Patel. The policies can <UNDER>never</UNDER> overlap.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Injuries, Litigation, Mediation and Settlement</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. The injuries suffered by Mr. Novak were significant, and included a displaced comminuted fracture of the right talus, treated by open reduction and internal fixation, a displaced fracture of the fibula, treated by open reduction and internal fixation, and avascular necrosis of the ankle bones due to poor healing. Mr. Novak produced an expert report calculating potential past and future loss of income at the low end, of $704,371, and at the high end of $821,780. A claim was also pursued for past and future care costs, supported by expert evidence, in the amount of $551,125.</P>
<P>19. Based on the damages exposure and liability concerns, <UNDER>including the potential that Mr. Patel would be held liable in his personal capacity</UNDER>, RSA and Aviva resolved the underlying action at a private mediation before mediator Ivan Luxemberg on February 28, 2017. Intact was invited to the mediation, but refused to attend.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa, Application Record of the Applicant, Tab 2, pg. 3, para. 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. The underlying action was resolved for <BOLD><UNDER>$380,000,</UNDER></BOLD> inclusive of all damages, interest, costs and disbursements. Based on the lack of certainty as to whether liability would be found against Mr. Patel in his personal capacity, in his capacity as an officer of 1062220, or in his capacity as an officer of Lakeland, the settlement was split 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 between the three competing interests, with the funding for Mr. Patel's personal 1/3 interest being split on a 50/50 basis by Aviva and RSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Adrian Serpa Application Record of the Applicant; Tab 2, pg. 2, para. 9</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Aviva's Duty to Defend and Indemnify Application before Justice Kristianson</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. After settling the action, Aviva brought an application before Justice Kristjanson to compel Intact to contribute to the defence costs incurred in defending, and the amounts paid to settle, the personal liability claim against their mutual insured Mr. Patel. RSA was not privy to that application.</P>
<P>22. Intact opposed Aviva's application and argued that it was <EM>res judicata</EM> given the previous application brought by RSA to have Intact contribute to Mr. Patel's defence costs. Intact further argued that it is an excess insurer only.</P>
<P>23. As further discussed below, Justice Kristjanson held that the application was not <EM>res judicata</EM> and her reason can be found at paragraphs 23 to 33 of <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 238</CITE></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 238</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. After finding that Aviva was not estopped from bringing the application, Justice Kristanjson went on to correctly find that the respective policies are <UNDER>not overlapping but complementary</UNDER>, and as such, the Intact policy could never sit as excess coverage.</P>
<P>25. Justice Kristanjon further found that it was inequitable to require Aviva to bear the entire burden of defending the action, and to indemnify Mr. Patel for the action against him in his personal capacity. Justice Kristanjson's reasons can be found at paragraphs 35 to 50.</P>
<P>26. For the reasons discussed below, it is respectfully submitted that this Honourable court should follow the reasoning provided by Justice Kristjanson in <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC></CASEREF>, and similarly order Intact to reimburse RSA for Intact's proportionate share of the $380,000 all-inclusive settlement paid on behalf of Mr. Patel in his personal capacity to the Plaintiff in the Underlying Action.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>IS RSA ESTOPPED FROM BRINGING THE WITHIN APPLICATION?</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. Intact may argue that RSA is estopped from bringing this application given the previous application brought by RSA before Justice Mew. RSA accepts that it is estopped from bringing an application for its defence costs incurred in <UNDER>defending</UNDER> Mr. Patel in his personal capacity. However, RSA is not estopped from pursuing the share paid to <UNDER>indemnify</UNDER> Mr. Patel in his personal capacity. That issue remains live between the parties.</P>
<P>28. <EM>Res judicata</EM> does not apply because:
<P1>(a) The question of indemnity was not addressed and decided by Justice Mew; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The question of indemnity cannot be the subject of issue estoppel, as indemnity cannot be determined on a duty to defend application.</P1></P>
<P>29. By this application, RSA is pursuing Intact <UNDER>only</UNDER> for its proportionate share of the settlement of the Underlying Action paid by RSA.</P>
<P>30. The question of indemnity cannot be the subject of issue estoppel as it was not, and could not have been, adjudicated by Justice Mew. A court hearing a duty to defend application is not in a position to determine the question of indemnity.</P>
<P>31. In <CASEREF><SOC>Papapetrou v. 1054422 Ontario Limited</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Papapetrou v. 1054422 Ontario Limited</SOC><CITE>2012 CarswellOnt 9127</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> on an application for a duty to defend, the motion's judge held that a duty to defend <UNDER>and indemnify</UNDER> existed on the part of the defendant, Collingwood Landscape Inc., in circumstances where it had not lived up to its obligation to add the applicant, The Cora Group, to its liability insurance coverage. On appeal, The Cora Group conceded that the question of indemnity was premature and the judge's finding should be set aside. The Court of Appeal agreed, stating the following at paragraphs 24 to 28:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>As I have said. The Cora Group Concedes that the Order that Collingwood indemnify them with respect to any damages awarded in the action is premature.</UNDER></P>
<P><UNDER>I agree with this concession. No evidence concerning the issues of liability or damages was led on the motion. ...</UNDER> [emphasis added]</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>To make an Order that Collingwood must indemnify The Cora Group, a court will first have to determine whether Collingwood's contractual obligation to indemnify has been triggered. As no evidence concerning the issues of liability or damages was lead on the motion, this cannot yet be determined. Accordingly, I would set aside the motion judge's order to indemnify.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at paras. 24-25 and 28</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>

<QUOTE><P>Any declaration which may ultimately be made on the insurer's obligation to defend actions, of course, cannot determine the right of indemnity under the policy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>33. Finally, in <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 238</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Kristjanson stated:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>The course pursued by RSA would have likely involved two separate proceedings</UNDER> [emphasis added], as it is clear that the ultimate question of Intact's duty to indemnify could not have been decided by the application judge as it was premature. A court hearing a duty to defend application is not in a position to determine the question of indemnity, in the absence of evidence concerning issues of liability and damages.</P>
<P>RSA's decision to raise the duty to defend issue at the time it did should not bind Aviva in the circumstances of this case. <UNDER>In any event, the issue of Intact's duty to indemnify has never been finally decided.</UNDER> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>SHOULD INTACT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE PERSONAL LIABILITY CLAIM AGAINST THEIR INSURED SANJAY PATEL?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>a)</EM></N><TI><UNDER><EM>The Policies are not Overlapping but rather are Complimentary</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>34. Justice Mew properly determined that based on the pleadings the Intact policy was triggered by the Novak claim, based on the possibility of personal liability on the part of Mr. Patel. This finding is consistent with a number of Ontario decisions on point, including <CASEREF><SOC>Doucet v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Doucet v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.</SOC><CITE>2017 CarswellOnt 2517</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 4</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Doucet</EM>, the insureds hosted a Christmas party for employees of their construction company at their home. One of the employees was injured at the party and commenced action against the Doucets. The Doucets tendered the action to both their homeowner's insurer, State Farm, and the construction company's insurer, Co-operators. The Doucets ultimately brought a successful coverage application against both insurers before Justice Mullins, who determined that both insurers owed a duty to defend based on the potential that liability could exist in the Doucet's personal capacity, given that the Christmas party was at their residence, as well as the Doucet's corporate capacity, given that the event was a corporate party.</P>
<P>35. Without explaining why, Justice Mew proceeded to compare the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the Intact and RSA policies, reaching the conclusion that they could be reconciled, with the RSA policy providing primary coverage and the Intact policy providing excess coverage. However, his Honour respectfully missed a critical step in the analysis as he was not referred to the leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 48</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> wherein the court considered the circumstances under which an insurer is entitled to equitable contribution from other insurers who have covered the same risk, stating the question as follows<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>:
<QUOTE><P>It is a well-established principle of insurance law that where an insured holds more than one policy of insurance <UNDER>that covers the same risk</UNDER>, the insured may never recover more than the amount of the full loss, but is entitled to select the policy under which to claim indemnity, subject to any conditions to the contrary. The selected insurer, in turn, is entitled to contribution from all other insurers <UNDER>who have covered the same risk</UNDER>. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. Only when it is determined that two insurance policies &ldquo;overlap&rdquo; is reference to the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the policies appropriate. The test for &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo; coverage was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada from Ivamy's <EM>General Principles of Insurance Law</EM> (6<SUP>th</SUP> Ed. 1993) at p. 518:
<P1>1) All of the policies concerned must comprise the same subject-matter;</P1>
<P1>2) All of the policies must be affected against the same peril;</P1>
<P1>3) All of the policies must be affected by or on behalf of the same assured;</P1>
<P1>4) All of the policies must be in force at the time of the loss;</P1>
<P1>5) All of the policies must be legal contracts of insurance; and</P1>
<P1>6) No policy must contain any stipulation by which it is exclude from contribution.</P1></P>
<P>37. In applying the <EM>Family Insurance</EM> test here, it is clear that the RSA and Intact policies are not &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;, as they fail parts (1) and (2) of the Ivamy test. The subject matter of theIntact policy, and the peril insured against, is the personal liability of Mr. Patel, with the Intact policy explicitly excluding coverage for Mr. Patel's business pursuits. The subject matter of the RSA policy, and the peril insured against, is the <UNDER>corporate</UNDER> liability of Lakeland. The RSA policy, based on its definition of &ldquo;insured&rdquo;, excludes coverage for Mr. Patel's personal actions. As such, the policies <BOLD><UNDER>never</UNDER></BOLD> overlap, and the Intact policy could <UNDER><EM>never</EM></UNDER> sit as excess coverage over the RSA policy.</P>
<P>38. This conclusion is supported by the wording of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the RSA and Intact policies. The &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact policy specifies:
<QUOTE><P>If you have other insurance which applies to a loss or claim, <UNDER>or would have applied if this policy did not exist</UNDER>..... [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>If the Intact policy did not exist, the RSA policy <UNDER>still</UNDER> would not apply to the personal liabilities of Mr. Patel, as those liabilities are specifically excluded.</P>
<P>39. The &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the RSA policy specifies:
<QUOTE><P>If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured <UNDER>for a loss we cover</UNDER>....[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The Intact policy cannot be &ldquo;valid and collectible insurance&rdquo; for a loss <UNDER>RSA</UNDER> covers, as the Intact policy specifically <UNDER>excludes</UNDER> the very liability covered by the RSA policy, that being the corporate liability of Lakeland. Accordingly, even ignoring the test in <EM>Family Insurance</EM>, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; provisions of the RSA and Intact policies cannot apply based on their own language.</P>
<P>40. A reference to Canadian case law on point will assist. In <CASEREF><SOC>Lumberman's Underwriting Alliance v. AXA Pacific Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lumberman's Underwriting Alliance v. AXA Pacific Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2006 BCSC 957</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the British Columbia Supreme Court recognized that the question of overlapping insurance coverage starts with <EM>Family Insurance</EM>. In <EM>Lumberman's</EM>, the insured, Pacific Forest Products, had two policies of insurance, a policy of property insurance obtained through Lumberman's which included Coverage for certain firefighting expenses arising out of the insured's logging operations, land a policy of third party liability insurance with AXA. Pacific was an additional insured on the AXA policy.</P>
<P>41. Lumberman's sought to recover from AXA a proportionate share of the firefighting costs incurred as a result of a fire which resulted from Pacific's operations. The question for the court was whether the policies were &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;, or instead, merely &ldquo;complementary&rdquo;. Counsel and the court agreed that the test was that set out in <EM>Family Insurance</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>[Lumberman's] argues that, having paid the expenses associated with fighting the fire, it is entitled to contribution from AXA according to the principles enunciated in <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>... which counsel agree is the correct approach for policies whose &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses purport to cancel each other out.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 39</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>42. The court differentiated between policies that are &ldquo;complementary&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 57</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>:
<QUOTE><P>The endorsement to the AXA policy further supports the defendant's position that these policies provide <UNDER>complementary</UNDER> coverage, not duplicate coverage. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>43. Here, and as accepted by Justice Kristjanson, the RSA and the Intact policies are &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; and not &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; or &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;, in that they co-incidentally respond at the same time to the Statement of Claim, but each responds to separate allegations relating to completely separate risks, one corporate, one personal.</P>
<P>44. In considering the six Ivamy principles from <EM>Family Insurance</EM>, the court concluded that the two policies, one being a property policy, the other being a liability policy, did not insure the same risk or the same peril, and accordingly, consideration of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the policies was inappropriate:
<QUOTE><P>The key to this case is, as the defendant asserts, the nature of the two policies. They do not insure the same risk or peril. The [Lumberman's] policy insures Pacific against property losses. The AXA policy insures GBA and Pacific against third-party claims.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 52</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>45. <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (CURIE) v. Halwell Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (CURIE) v. Halwell Mutual Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>1998 CarswellOnt. 4932</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> involved similar issues to those here. Brian Wilson attended McMaster University. He was covered by his parent's homeowner's insurance policy, which included liability coverage, and, as president of Edwards Hall at McMaster University, he was also covered by the University's liability insurance policy issued by the Canadian University Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (&ldquo;CURIE&rdquo;).</P>
<P>46. Wilson oversaw a frosh week event in which Martin Woitzik was rendered a quadriplegic when he dove into a mud pit. Woitzik sued Wilson and others. CURIE acknowledged a duty to defend Wilson in his role as president of Edwards Hall. The homeowner's insurer, Co-operators, denied coverage. Though the court did ultimately support Co-operators' denial position, it went on to consider whether or not the Co-operators' homeowner's policy and the CURIE commercial liability policy could be considered &ldquo;Overlapping&rdquo; coverage. While <CASEREF><SOC>CURIE v. Halwell Mutual</SOC></CASEREF> predates <EM>Family Insurance</EM>, the court nonetheless applied the six Ivamy principles, concluding that the CURIE and Co-operators policies were not &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;, as they did not cover the same risk, nor the same subject matter, stating:
<QUOTE><P>An insurer's right to contribution arises where another policy provides coverage for the same loss. Some of the cases refer to &ldquo;double coverage&rdquo;. It is clear that it does not arise where one policy is primary and other excess, <UNDER>nor where the policies covered different risks or different parts of a risk.</UNDER><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ibid<EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 20</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>47. The court held that the CURIE commercial policy was meant to indemnify the institution (and thereby its employee Wilson), while the Co-operators homeowner's policy was intended to cover Wilson's personal risks. Accordingly, reference to, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the two policies was inappropriate.</P>
<P>48. The trial judge's decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance v Halwell Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2002 CarswellOnt. 2766</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> by which time <EM>Family Insurance</EM> had been decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court of Appeal agreed that there was no concurrence of coverage between the two policies, as the business exemption in the Co-operators' policy meant the policies were not &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;, stating:

Alexander Holburn Beaudin &amp; Lang</SOC><CITE>2011 CarswellBC 90</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 9</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Jeremy Poole was sued by Michelle Danicek for serious personal injuries she suffered when Poole fell on her in a nightclub. The nightclub outing followed an event sponsored by the law firm where they both worked. The question of Poole's liability insurance coverage involved the capacity in which Poole was acting at the time. Poole had a tenant's insurance policy with Co-operators, while his employer/law firm had a liability insurance policy with Lombard General Insurance Company. Co-operators agreed to defend Poole. Lombard denied coverage.</P>
<P>50. Poole and Co-operators reached a settlement with Danicek, and Co-operators then pursued equitable contribution to the defence costs and settlement from Lombard. The court held that the Lombard commercial policy was triggered by the allegations made against Poole, an employee of the firm, which triggered a duty to defend. The court next considered whether or not the Co-operators and Lombard policies were &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;. Co-operators had taken the position that the policies were overlapping, and further, that the Lombard policy was a primary policy based on the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the two insurance policies. The court rejected this argument, holding that the relationship between the policies was governed instead by equitable considerations, as established by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Broadhurst &amp; Ball v. American Home Assurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Broadhurst &amp; Ball v.

<P>51. In Ontario, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses of two liability insurance policies cannot be considered where the two policies do not cover the same risk or even the same <UNDER>layer</UNDER> of risk. <CASEREF><SOC>McKenzie v.

Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2007 CarswellOnt. 4091</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> involved the question of whether a homeowner's liability policy issued to the father of a boat operator, or instead a State Farm personal liability umbrella policy issued to the boat owner, should respond to the allegations of negligence against the boat's operator. Reference to the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the two policies was <UNDER>deemed inappropriate</UNDER> by the Court of Appeal, as the two policies did not insure the same <UNDER>level</UNDER> of risk, with the court stating at paragraph 21:
<QUOTE><P>To be clear, I respectfully disagree with the respondent Dominion's submission, and the application Judge's conclusion, that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the PLUP and the homeowner's policy are irreconcilable. <UNDER>Such a conclusion is only possible where the policies in question cover the same level of risk.</UNDER> The two policies in issue before this court do not. The PLUP is a true umbrella policy while the homeowner's policy is a primary policy, which pays first dollar insurance coverage unless there is other insurance. The reference to &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; in a primary policy can only reasonably refer to other primary insurance. Were it otherwise, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in primary policies would make them excess or umbrella policies, which is clearly not the intent of a primary policy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at para. 21</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>

Canadian Surety Co.</SOC><CITE>1994 CarswellAlta. 122</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 12</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Alberta Court of Appeal dealt with a question of overlapping coverage arising out of an automobile accident. The insured, Turner Valley Transport, was sued as a result of a motor vehicle accident involving one of its trucks. Markel Insurance Company of Canada issued a liability insurance policy to Turner Valley covering its liability for all vehicles owned by it. The trailer involved in the accident was owned by Turner Valley. Aetna Insurance Company of Canada had issued a non-owner's liability policy to Turner Valley, which covered the tractor involved in the accident, which was not owned by Turner Valley. Amongst the questions for the court was whether or not equitable contribution/restitution was available to Aetna.</P>
<P>53. The trial judge, applying Ivamy's six principles, held that contribution/restitution was not available between Aetna and Canadian Surety, as their policies covered different perils. On appeal, the Alberta Court of Appeal differed with the trial judge as to which part of the Ivamy test was not met, though the court reached the same result, determining that equitable contribution/restitution was not available, as the two policies insured different <UNDER>perils</UNDER>:
<QUOTE><P>I agree that because Markel and Aetna insure against liability arising from I different automobiles (the tractor and the trailer), contribution does not apply. I would not, however, characterize this as a failure to meet (1) of Ivamy (the same subject matter), but rather a failure to meet (2), namely all policies must insure against the same peril...</P>
<P>However, in my view, the policies do not cover the same peril. The peril insured against is the claim of the third party which <EM>arises from the particular vehicle insured</EM>. The peril might include negligent operation of a vehicle insured or negligence in allowing a defective vehicle on the road, or statutory liability. Whatever the action, the peril will be liability arising from the <EM>ownership, use or operation</EM> of the vehicle or in Aetna's case the use of the vehicle insured.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at paras. 190 and 192</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>

<QUOTE><P>On the facts of the present case, it appears to me that, as a simple matter of fairness between insurers under concurrent obligations to defend, and, as well, in fairness to the insured, Guardian should pay a proper share of the costs of defence. It follows that American Homes should be able to compel such payment. Since these insurers have no agreement between themselves with respect to the defence, their respective obligations cannot be a matter of contract. Nonetheless, their obligations should be subject to and governed by principles of equity and good conscience, which, in my opinion, dictate that the costs of litigation should be equitably distributed between them.</P></QUOTE></P>

<BLOCK4><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>Where a Liability Insurer Refuses to Participate in the Defence of the Action, it Cannot Subsequently Question a Settlement Reached in the Underlying Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. Intact may argue that it is not bound by the settlement reached by RSA and Aviva at mediation, even though that settlement included a payment towards the risk covered by Intact, on the basis that Intact did not participate in the mediation. Intact was given the opportunity to participate in the mediation, and refused. In such circumstances, RSA and Aviva were free to settle without Intact's approval, provided that they acted reasonably and in good faith in settling the underlying action. There is no evidence to the contrary, and this court must presume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the two insurers would not settle the Underlying Action gratuitously.</P>
<P>57. The law supports RSA's position. In <CASEREF><SOC>Reliance Petroleum Limited v. Stevenson</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Reliance Petroleum Limited v. Stevenson</SOC><CITE>1953 CarswellOnt. 87</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 13, reversed on other grounds 1954 CarswellOnt. 84, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 14, affirmed, 1956 CarswellOnt 83, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 15</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Canadian General Insurance Company denied coverage to its insured Reliance Petroleum, which was sued for damages for a number of claims arising out of a fire allegedly caused by it. Reliance settled the underlying action and sued Canadian General for recovery. Canadian General argued that Reliance had not taken the underling actions to trial. This argument was rejected by the court, as Canadian General had not participated in the underlying actions in violation of its policy terms, with the court stating:
<QUOTE><P>It may seem appropriate to dispose of this defence of the defendant Canadian General Insurance Company at this time. It has been pointed out that by the policy issued by that defendant it covenanted to serve the insured by the investigation of claims and the defence in the name and on behalf of the insured of any suit against the insured, and in my opinion, it was the defendant's failure to carry out these covenants in this policy which required the plaintiff to take the action it did take and so long as the settlements were reasonable, the defendant cannot rely on its failure to carry out its covenants to refute the claim of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Therefore, without having to determine whether or not what occurred in the Finnemore, Morrison, Dalton, Thompson and Mordush cases did constitute an actual trial, I find against the defence of the Canadian General Insurance Company for the reason that I am of the opinion that its complete denial of liability, relying on the exclusions of the policy, excused the plaintiff from defending each claim to trial and running the risk (in this case, the certain risk as to several of the claimants) of much heavier verdicts for damages and for costs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at paras. 20 and 28</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>

Red River Valley Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>1994 CarswellMan. 126</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Applicants, Tab 16</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the defendant insurer Red River denied coverage, alleging a lack of co-operation on the part of its insured. The insured, on its own, settled the underlying action with the plaintiffs for $45,000, and sued to recover that amount from Red River. Red River took the position that it was not liable, as the insured voluntarily paid a settlement to the plaintiffs where no formal determination of the insured's liability had been made. The Manitoba Court of Appeal rejected this argument, holding that where an insurer denies coverage, the injured is free to make a reasonable settlement and seek indemnity from its insurer, stating:
<QUOTE><P>Is there any reason in Canada not to extend the principle permitting assignment to circumstances such as these were settlement has been negotiated between the insured and the claimant? I see none especially in light of the now well-established principle that when an insurer wrongly denies coverage to the insured, the insured is free to make a reasonable settlement; <CASEREF><SOC>Reliance Petroleum Ltd. v. Stevenson</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>. See, as well, the comments of Hutcheon J. (as he then was) in <EM>Shore Boat Builders Ltd</EM>. at p.95.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>It is my conclusion that the trial judge was in error when he dismissed the plaintiff's action on the overly simplistic basis that the insured &ldquo;had suffered no loss&rdquo;. The insurer wrongfully repudiated its contractual liability to defend and indemnify its insured McMurachy. In order to protect itself from the exposure of significant personal liability, the insured entered into a settlement with the claimant which he was clearly entitled to do. At that moment, at the latest, the insurer's responsibility was fixed and the arrangement made thereafter for assignment of the claim and future protection of the insured, all arising from the breach of contract of the insurer, does not negate the insurer's obligation to indemnify under the terms of the policy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at paras. 21 and 29</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P>1. The Respondent, Intact Financial Corporation (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;), takes the position that this Application is an abuse of process and should be dismissed under the doctrines of <EM>res judicata</EM> and/or issue estoppel.</P>
<P>2. The Applicant, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company (&ldquo;RSA&rdquo;) brought a previous Application against Intact, seeking an order that Intact had a duty to defend and indemnify RSA with respect to the same loss, which Application was heard on January 20, 2016. The Honourable Justice Graeme Mew held that the Intact Policy was excess to the RSA policy, and therefore the Intact policy did not come into play. Justice Mew's decision is dated January 20, 2016 (&ldquo;the decision&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. This Application is an abuse of process because RSA is attempting to re-litigate the issues which were already decided by Justice Mew.</P>
<P>4. If RSA wanted to dispute the decision, the proper procedure would have been to file an Appeal. RSA chose not to do so.</P>
<P>5. The Respondent seeks the following:
<P1>(a) An Order dismissing the Application; and,</P1>
<P1>(b) Costs of responding to this Application on a substantial indemnity scale.</P1></P></BLOCK2>

<P1>i. A declaration that Intact has a duty to defend Patel;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>ii. A declaration that Intact had a duty to indemnify Patel;</BOLD></P1>

<P>11. The Previous Coverage Application was heard on January 20, 2016 before the Honourable Justice Graeme Mew. Justice Mew held that the Intact Policy was triggered by the claims in the Underlying Action, but that the Intact Policy was excess to the RSA Policy pursuant to an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy. The decision reads, in part, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[7] There is, however, an important limiting factor. The respondent's policy provides that if an insured has &ldquo;other insurance which applies to a loss or claim&rdquo; the respondent's policy &ldquo;will be considered excess insurance&rdquo; and will not respond &ldquo;until the amount of such other insurance is used up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>18] The applicant is being defended by RSA in the main action. He is not (yet) being defended on the cross-claims, although it is not apparent from the record why this is so.</P>
<P>[9] The RSA policy has an &ldquo;Other Insurance&rdquo; provision, which renders the RSA policy primary unless there is another policy which is also primary, or if the other insurance is &ldquo;Property Insurance&rdquo;, a term not defined in the RSA policy.</P>
<P>[10] In my view, as the coverage available to the applicant under the respondent's policy vis-a-vis the Novak claim falls under the policy's liability coverage, the fact that it also insures the applicant's property does not make the whole policy &ldquo;Property Insurance&rdquo; for the purposes of the RSA &ldquo;Other Insurance&rdquo; condition,</P>
<P>[11] <BOLD><UNDER>As a result, the respondent's [Intact] policy is excess to the RSA policy. The coverage provided by the respondent's policy only becomes available once the RSA coverage (and any other primary coverage available to the applicant) is used up.</UNDER></BOLD> As a result, no obligation for the respondent to defend has arisen yet.

<P>12. In the within Application, RSA has suggested that Justice Mew acted under his own initiative, &ldquo;without explanation&rdquo;, to compare the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the respective policies. In actuality, Intact had opposed the Application on the these grounds. Intact raised the issue in the Previous Coverage Application that the Intact Policy was excess in its factum. This issue was also argued by both sides during oral submissions. RSA had every opportunity to dispute the application of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause at the previous Application.

<P>13. Justice Mew was able to reconcile the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses and he found that they did not cancel each other out. In doing so, Justice Mew cited that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy expressly stated that it was excess, whereas, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the RSA Policy stated that it was primary.

<P>14. More than 1 year after the Previous Coverage Application was decided, The Underlying Action settled at a private mediation on February 28, 2017 for $380,000.00. The settlement was for less than the RSA policy limits of $2,000,000.00. Intact did not attend the mediation, having already obtained a Decision from Justice Mew that the Intact Policy was excess to the RSA policy.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>20. The issue to be determined in this application is whether the Respondent owes a duty to indemnify the Applicant with respect to the claims in the Underlying Action. In order to answer this question, the following issues must be addressed:
<P1>i. Should the Application be dismissed because it is <EM>res judicata</EM> and/or an abuse of process?</P1>
<P1>ii. If the Application is not <EM>res judicata</EM> and/or an abuse of process, did Justice Mew err in deciding that the Intact Policy was excess?</P1>
<P1>iii. Is RSA entitled to equitable relief from Intact?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>#1:</N><TI>RES JUDICATA / ABUSE OF PROCESS</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Law</EM></TI>
<P>21. The Respondent submits that the Application should be dismissed, as it is <EM>res judicata</EM>. Specifically, the Respondent relies on the branch of <EM>res judicata</EM> known as issue estoppel, which prevents a party from litigating an issue that has already been decided in a previous proceeding.</P>
<P>22. The doctrine of issue estoppel has three elements:
<P1>1. The same question has been decided;</P1>
<P1>2. The prior judicial decision was final; and</P1>
<P1>3. The parties, or their privies, must be the same.</P1>

<P2><BOLD>Brief of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 1</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>23. The Supreme Court has held that the three elements of issue estoppel should not be applied in a rigid or mechanical fashion. The underlying purpose is to balance the public interest of the finality of litigation with the public interest that justice is done.

<P>24. The Supreme Court has held that, even where issue estoppel is not available because the parties are not exactly the same, the Court has discretion to dismiss a claim under the doctrine of abuse of process in order to prevent a party from re-litigating an issue that has already been decided, or ought reasonably to have been raised in earlier proceedings.

<P>25. The Supreme Court has endorsed the use of the doctrine of abuse of process to prevent relitigation, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Canadian courts have applied the doctrine of abuse of process to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity/mutuality requirements) are not met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice...</P>
<P>The attraction of the doctrine of abuse of process is that it is unencumbered by the specific requirements of res judicata while offering the discretion to prevent relitigation, essentially for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the court's process.</P></QUOTE>

<P2><BOLD>Brief of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>26. The Respondent submits that issue estoppel ought to apply in the within case [because all three of the preconditions have been met: The same issue has been decided; the decision was final; and the parties are the same.</P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Same Issue Has Been Decided</EM></TI>
<P>27. One of the issues decided in the Previous Coverage Application was that the Intact Policy was excess to the RSA Policy.</P>
<P>28. By deciding that the Intact Policy was excess, Justice Mew already decided that the Intact Policy cannot come into play to unless and until RSA's policy limits are used up. Therefore, the issue of whether Intact has a duty to indemnify has already been decided.</P>
<P>29. Where a policy is excess, there is no distinction between a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify. A policy cannot be excess for the purposes of a duty to defend, but not excess for a duty to indemnify. In <CASEREF><SOC>Axa v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal discussed the interplay between a duty to defend, a duty to indemnify and an excess clause:
<QUOTE><P>Axa contends that the application judge erred by concluding that Dominion's excess coverage provision applied to both its duty to defend and its duty to indemnify. Axa submits that if it applies at all, it applies only to the duty to indemnify for losses above $1 million; it does not apply to Dominion's duty to defend Dr. Isen which, asserts Axa, is a primary obligation.</P>
<P>The application judge rejected Axa's argument. He stated:
<QUOTE><P>Dominion has no obligation to defend until it is determined that AXA's limits have been used up. If that occurs, Dominion is liable to pay the pro rata share of the defence costs. If there are special circumstances, further directions may be sought.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>I agree. Dominion's policy states that it &ldquo;will not pay any loss or <EM>claim</EM> until the amount of such other insurance is used up&rdquo; (emphasis added). <BOLD><UNDER>Axa's argument amounts to an attempt to create a distinction, which does not appear in the policy, between a claim for indemnity and a claim for a defence. The excess insurance provision does not make this distinction, but refers only to a claim or a loss covered by other insurance.</UNDER></BOLD> <BOLD><UNDER>Since the claim for a defence is covered by Axa's policy, Dominion's policy Is excess to Axa's policy in respect of both Dr. Isen's claim for indemnity and his claim for a defence.</UNDER></BOLD> On the plain wording of Dominion's policy, Dominion does not have to pay any claim for defence costs until Axa's obligation to defend is &ldquo;used up&rdquo;.

<P>30. Justice Mew's decision was not limited to the issue of duty to defend and contribution to defence costs. As addressed in <CASEREF><SOC>AXA v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>, the decision that the Intact Policy was excess applies to both the duty to defend <BOLD><UNDER>and</UNDER></BOLD> the duty to indemnify.</P>
<P>31. Justice Mew decided that Intact did not have a duty to indemnify Patel unless the policy limits of the RSA Policy (and any other primary coverage) was used up. As the Underlying Action settled for less than the policy limits of the RSA Policy, the Intact Policy cannot come into play, based on Justice Mew's decision.</P>
<P>32. In the within Application, the Applicants are arguing that Justice Mew's decision was incorrect. The correctness of Justice Mew's decision is not open for debate in the within Application. There was no appeal.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Decision Was Final</EM></TI>
<P>33. There is no question that the decision of Justice Mew was final and was not appealed.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Parties Are The Same</EM></TI>
<P>34. The Respondent submits that the parties to the Applications are the same. The Previous Coverage Application was brought by RSA in Patel's name. The Application was brought for RSA's benefit. Patel had no interest in the outcome of the Application.</P>
<P>35. The Respondent submits that RSA was a de facto party and/or a privy of Patel in the Previous Coverage Application and therefore, the same party requirement of issue estoppel is met.</P>
<P>36. The concept of privity is elastic. The determination of whether there is privity must be made on a case-by-case basis. Privity is established where the decision rendered against one should be binding on the other.

<P>37. Even if the requirements of issue estoppel are not technically met because the parties are not exactly the same, the Respondent submits that the Court should dismiss the Application under the doctrine of abuse of process in order to prevent re-litigation.</P>
<P>38. The application of the doctrine of abuse of process to prevent re-litigation allows the Court to maintain the integrity of the adjudicative process by avoiding inconsistent results in separate proceedings, which the Supreme Court has found would undermine the credibility of the entire judicial process.

<P>39. In the within case, it would be unfair to allow RSA to succeed on the within Application given Justice Mew's previous decision; As a result of Justice Mew's decision, Intact had a reasonable belief that the Policy was excess and therefore chose not to participate in the action or attend at the mediation. Intact would be prejudiced if forced to indemnify RSA for a settlement reached without Intact's input.</P></BLOCK6></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>40. The Respondent respectfully takes the position that this Application is not the proper forum to dispute whether or not Justice Mew erred in deciding that the Intact Policy was excess. However, if this Honourable Court decides that this issue ought to be re-litigated, the Respondent submits that Justice Mew did not err. More specifically, Justice Mew did not err by failing to cite the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance v. Lombard Canada Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF></P>
<P>41. Whether or not Justice Mew considered a particular case is an issue that could have been dealt with during an appeal, not a separate Application.</P>
<P>42. Regardless, the Respondent denies that <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance v. Lombard</SOC></CASEREF>, was applicable to the issues in the Previous Coverage Application, as has been alleged by RSA.

<P2><BOLD>Brief of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 6</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>43. The <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance v. Lombard</SOC></CASEREF> decision stands for the principle that where two insurance policies contain competing &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses <BOLD><EM>which cannot be reconciled</EM>,</BOLD> the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses cancel each other out and the Court should apply the doctrine of equitable contribution. The first step is to determine if the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses can be reconciled. Only where there is a &ldquo;true impasse&rdquo; does the law of equitable contribution come into play. If the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses can be reconciled, equitable contribution is not available.</P>
<P>44. The <EM>Family Insurance</EM> case is not part of an analysis into interpreting or applying an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 48</CITE><PARANUM>32&ndash;34</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Brief of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 6</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>45. The thrust of the <EM>Family Insurance</EM> decision was addressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of <CASEREF><SOC>McKenzie v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company</SOC></CASEREF>. In that case, a primary insurer argued that an excess insurer should contribute to defence costs pursuant to the doctrine of equitable contribution. The Ontario Court of Appeal clarified that the <EM>Family Insurance</EM> decision is not applicable where there are &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses <BOLD>which can be reconciled.</BOLD> In circumstances where the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses can be reconciled (for example, if one policy is primary and one policy is excess), equitable contribution does <BOLD><UNDER>not</UNDER></BOLD> come into play. The Court of Appeal explained the analysis as follows:
<QUOTE><P>While both policies provide similarly worded other insurance clauses, they will only effectively cancel one another out if, to use the language of Family Insurance, supra, at para. 28, the parties were under &ldquo;coordinate obligation to make good the loss&rdquo;. In this case there can be no doubt that the State Family PLUP, by its language, was written in contemplation of there being other underlying insurance coverage. The Dominion policy was not; its coverage language makes it clear that the intention was that it provide primary insurance. These are not policies of coordinate obligation.</P>
<P>To be clear, I respectfully disagree with the respondent Dominion's submission, and the application judge's conclusion, that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the PLUP and the home owner's policy are irreconcilable. Such a conclusion is only possible where the policies in question cover the same level of risk. The two policies in issue before this court do not. The PLUP is a true umbrella policy while the homeowner's policy is a primary policy, which pays first dollar insurance coverage unless there is other insurance. The reference to &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; in a primary policy can only reasonably refer to other primary insurance. Were it otherwise, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in primary policies would make them excess or umbrella policies, which is clearly not the intent of a primary policy.</P>
<P>Second, in my view, both the application judge and the respondent Dominion have misinterpreted Family Insurance, supra. It seems to me that if the Supreme Court of Canada had intended to do away with any distinction among primary, excess and/or umbrella policies of insurance it would have done so in clear and express language to that effect.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>As I have said, in my view the reasoning in Family Insurance simply does not apply in the circumstances of this case where, as I discussed above, the relevant policies of insurance provide different layers of coverage, or, stated another way, where the contest is between a primary insurer and an excess or umbrella insurer. Unlike the situation in Family Insurance, we are not here concerned with two primary policies (leaving the boat owner policy aside) with similar &ldquo;other insurance clauses&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE>

<P>47. Justice Mew reconciled the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clauses in the Intact Policy and the RSA Policy.

<P>49. There is no requirement that two polices be &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo; in order for an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause to apply. For example, in the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Axa v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>, a claim arose out of personal injury which occurred while an Individual was using a bungee cord to secure a Cushion to a boat which was hitched to a car trailer. The bungee cord detached and struck his friend in the eye. There were three policies which potentially covered the loss: a motor vehicle liability policy, a boat liability policy and a homeowner's policy. Clearly, these policies are not entirely overlapping, as they cover separate risks. The boat policy acknowledged that its coverage was triggered but argued that it was excess to the motor vehicle liability policy pursuant to an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause. The Court agreed. In determining that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the boat policy applied to make it excess, the Court of Appeal did not address or consider whether the policies were &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;. In other words, this is not a relevant consideration in the analysis of whether an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause applies.

<P>50. In <CASEREF><SOC>Axa v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>, The Court of Appeal found that the boat policy was excess to a motor vehicle liability policy based on an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause, which read as follows:

<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Brief of Authorities, Tab 4</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>51. In the within case, the Intact Policy contains the following &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause, which is very similar to the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause of the boat policy discussed in <CASEREF><SOC>Axa v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>. The relevant portion of the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy states:
<QUOTE><P>If you have other insurance which applies to a loss or claim, or would have applied if this policy did not exist, this policy will be considered excess insurance and we will not pay any loss or claim until the amount of such other insurance is used up.</P></QUOTE>

<P>52. In contrast, The RSA Policy contains an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause, which expressly stipulates that it is primary, unless criteria which are no currently present, are met:
<P1>(a) PRIMARY INSURANCE
<QUOTE><P>This insurance is primary except when (b) applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all other insurance by the method described in (c) below.</P></QUOTE></P1>

<P2><BOLD>Responding Application Record, Tab 2B</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>53. A plain reading of the terms of the RSA Policy reveals that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause has the effect of making the RSA Policy primary to any coverage that is not properly insurance or coverage arising out of the insured premises. The Intact Policy provides coverage for liability insurance which is not property insurance. Consequently, the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy clearly applies, thereby making the RSA Policy primary coverage in respect of this loss.</P>
<P>54. As a result of the excess clause in the Intact Policy, the Respondent does not have a duty to indemnify unless and until the policy limits of the RSA Policy are used up, which is impossible now that the claim settled for well under the available limits.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>55. The Respondent disputes that the Applicant should be entitled to equitable relief.</P>
<P>56. In <CASEREF><SOC>Family Insurance Corp. v.

The doctrine is founded on the general principle that parties under a &ldquo;coordinate liability&rdquo; to make good a loss must share that burden pro rata. Where two policies do not cover the same risk (as RSA alleges is the case here), then equitable contribution is not available.

<P1>i. All the policies concerned must comprise the same subject matter</P1>
<P1>ii. All the polices must be effected against the same peril</P1>
<P1>iii. All the policies must be effected by or on behalf of the same assured</P1>
<P1>iv. All the polices must be in force at the time of the loss</P1>
<P1>v. All the polices must be legal contracts of insurance</P1>
<P1>vi. No policy must contain any stipulation by which it is excluded from contribution (such as an &ldquo;other insurance clause&rdquo;)</P1>

<P>58. The Ivamy Principles are not a precondition to the application of an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause. In fact, the 6th of the Ivamy Principles would include a consideration of whether an &ldquo;other insurance clause&rdquo; was present (criteria vi).</P>
<P>59. The Ivamy Principles set out 6 preconditions which must be met in order for an Insurer to seek equitable contribution from another insurer, just as RSA is seeking equitable contribution from Intact in the within Application.</P>
<P>60. The Ivamy Principles define the parameters when one insurer can seek indemnification from another insurer which covers the same risk. The Ivamy Principles do not dictate the circumstances when an insurer can invoke an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause.</P>
<P>61. Where the 6 Ivamy principles are not met (for example because an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause excludes contribution) an insurer is not entitled to equitable contribution from another insurer which covers the same risk.</P>
<P>62. For example, in the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance Exchange v. Halwell Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, a CGL insurer sought equitable contribution from a home insurer which allegedly insured the same risk. The Court found that the CGL insurer was not entitled to equitable contribution because the homeowner's insurer had an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause which applied. Whether or not the policies were overlapping was not relevant. This is exactly the situation in the case at bar. If the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy applies (and Justice Mew already decided it does), RSA is not entitled to equitable contribution.

<P>63. In the present case, Justice Mew has already determined that the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy <BOLD>can be reconciled</BOLD> with the &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the RSA Policy, just as was the case in <CASEREF><SOC>CURIE v. Halwell</SOC></CASEREF>. Therefore, equitable contribution does <BOLD><UNDER>not</UNDER></BOLD> apply.</P>
<P>64. Even if the principles of equitable contribution were to apply, the Applicants must prove that that the 6 Ivamy Principles have been met in order to seek equitable contribution from Intact. The Applicant's submission in their factum that the 6 Ivamy Principles do not apply supports the Respondent's position and precludes Aviva's right to seek equitable contribution.</P>
<P>65. Finally, the Respondent submits that there are no other equitable grounds which would entitle RSA to relief from Intact.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>66. In summary, the Respondent submits that the Application should be dismissed on the grounds the Application is <EM>res judicata</EM> and/or an abuse of process.</P>
<P>67. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that it does not have a duty to indemnify the Applicant due to the existence of an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; clause in the Intact Policy.</P>
<P>68. The Respondent seeks the following:
<P1>(a) An Order dismissing the Application;</P1>
<P1>(b) Costs of responding to this Application on a substantial indemnity scale.</P1></P>
