<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>THE APPLICANT (APPELLANT) THE COMMONWELL MUTUAL INSURANCE GROUP (&ldquo;COMMONWELL&rdquo;) APPEALS to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice MacLeod dated October 4, 2018, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at Ottawa.</P>
<P>THE APPELLANT ASKS that the judgment be set aside and judgement be granted as follows:</P>
<P>1. Granting a declaration that the appellant is not obliged to defend or indemnify the Respondent in Ontario Superior Court of Justice action No. 15-64061 commenced in Ottawa (&ldquo;the Action&rdquo;);</P>
<P>2. Costs payable to Commonwell; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel for Commonwell may request and that this Honourable Court considers just.</P>
<P>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL are as follows:</P>
<P>1. Commonwell appeals a decision of the Superior Court of Justice <EM>per</EM> Justice MacLeod dated October 4, 2018 wherein the Applicant's (Appellant's) application was dismissed.</P>
<P>2. Commonwell provided liability coverage to the respondent from February 14, 2013 to February 14, 2014 pursuant to a residential insurance policy no. XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The Respondent seeks a defence and indemnity from Commonwell in the Action. Commonwell brought an Application for a declaration that it was not obliged to defend or indemnify the Respondent.</P>
<P>4. The Statement of Claim in the Action alleges that the Respondent was negligent in the operation of a 2001 Honda R4C off road dirt bike owned by another (the &ldquo;dirt bike&rdquo;), causing personal injury to the plaintiff.</P>
<P>5. Commonwell states that the allegations made in the Statement of Claim of the Action are not covered by the Policy. Specifically, the Policy did not cover the operation of the dirt bike.</P>
<P>6. His Honour hearing the Application did not determine whether the Policy covered the dirt bike. Instead, he held that regardless of whether the Policy provided coverage, Commonwell had either waived its rights or was estopped from denying coverage.</P>
<P>7. It is respectfully submitted that the Learned Judge hearing the Application erred in law and fact by:
<P1>(a) Providing inadequate reasons for the decision;</P1>
<P1>(b) Finding that the Action had proceeded to discoveries when the first inquiries were made as to coverage issues, when in fact, inquiries were made a preliminary stage and not in the context of oral discoveries;</P1>
<P1>(c) Incorrectly articulating Commonwell's position with respect to consent, finding that Commonwell took the position that Mr, Campbell did not have consent, when in fact, it was Commonwell's position that the issue of consent was a live one on the pleadings, thereby giving rise to a duty of defend. Rather, Commonwell took the position that if at trial it is found that there is no consent there may be no duty to indemnify under the Policy;</P1>
<P1>(d) Finding that Commonwell could not rely on the issue of consent given that a reservation of rights was not provided, when the evidence regarding when the issue of consent was raised was not discussed at the hearing and there was insufficient evidence filed with respect to same;</P1>
<P1>(e) Failing to determine whether the Policy provided coverage for the allegations made in the Action, and specifically, that the Policy did not provide coverage for same;</P1>
<P1>(f) Failing to distinguish between waiver and estoppel in his reasons;</P1>
<P1>(g) Inappropriately applying the case law wherein insurers have been found to have estopped themselves by defending a claim through production, discovery and settlement negotiations without a reservation of rights. His Honour failed to distinguish between those cases and the matter at hand where coverage became an issue at a very early stage in the action;</P1>
<P1>(h) Applying the doctrine of estoppel without finding any detrimental reliance on the part of the Respondent;</P1>
<P1>(i) <CASEREF><SOC>Misapplying Economical Insurance Group v. Fleming</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>89 OR (3D) 68</CITE></CASEREF> and other law to find waiver without finding that there was any express waiver in writing;</P1>
<P1>(j) Failing to consider the requirements of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 and specifically section 131(1) which requires waiver to be in writing;</P1>
<P1>(k) Failing to consider the Policy wording which required waiver to be in writing; and</P1>
<P1>(l) Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court permit.</P1></P>
<P>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</P>
<P>1. The decision of His Honour Justice MacLeod is final;</P>
<P>2. Section 6(l)(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, as amended; and</P>
<P>3. Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;STATEMENT</TI>
<P>1. The Appellant, The Commonwell Mutual Insurance Group (&ldquo;Commonwell&rdquo;), appeals the judgment of the Honourable Justice MacLeod dated October 4, 2018 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at Ottawa.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. Commonwell is an Ontario insurer which at all material times provided liability coverage to the responding party, Shayne Campbell (&ldquo;the respondent&rdquo;) pursuant to a residential insurance policy no. XXXXXXXXXX effective from February 14, 2013 to February 14, 2014 (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD><EM>Affidavit of Iain Convery</EM>, sworn August 2, 2016 <EM>(&ldquo;Convery Affidavit&rdquo;)</EM> at Exhibits B and C, Exhibit Book at tabs 1B and 1C, pp. 21&ndash;65; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, p. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>3. The Respondent seeks a defence and indemnity from Commonwell in Ontario Superior Court of Justice Action number 15-64061 commenced in Ottawa (the &ldquo;Action&rdquo;). Commonwell brought an Application for a declaration that it was not obliged to defend or indemnify the Respondent.</P>
<P>4. The Honourable Justice hearing the Application held that regardless of whether the Policy provided coverage, Commonwell had either waived its rights or was estopped from denying coverage. It was also held that the Respondent was entitled to defence and indemnity.</P>
<P>5. Commonwell states that the issues are as follows:
<P1>(a) Were the reasons given for the decision adequate?</P1>
<P1>(b) Is the Respondent entitled to both defence and indemnity?</P1>
<P1>(c) Does waiver apply?</P1>
<P1>(d) Does estoppel apply?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>6. The Statement of Claim in the Action alleges that the Respondent was negligent in the operation of a 2001 Honda R4C off road dirt bike owned by another individual (the &ldquo;Dirt Bike&rdquo;), causing personal injury to the plaintiff.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at Exhibit A, Exhibit Book at tab 1A, pp. 6&ndash;20; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, p. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. Commonwell states that the allegations made in the Statement of Claim of the Action are not covered by the Policy. Specifically, the Policy did not cover the operation of the Dirt Bike.</P>
<P>8. With some exceptions, the Policy generally excludes liability coverage for the use or operation of any motorized vehicle. The Policy will provide liability coverage for the use or operation of a self-propelled land vehicle that the Respondent does not own, provided that the vehicle does not need to be registered under any government authority.</P>
<P>9. The Policy wording provided details of the liability coverage at Section 2&mdash;Coverage E. The relevant sections of the policy are as follows:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2 LABEL="Coverage"><N>E</N><TI>LEGAL LIABILITY</TI>
<P>&ldquo;We&rdquo; will pay all sums which &ldquo;you&rdquo; become legally liable to pay as compensatory damages because of &ldquo;bodily injury&rdquo; or &ldquo;property damage&rdquo;.</P>
<P>The amount of insurance is the maximum amount &ldquo;we&rdquo; will pay under one or more Sections of Coverage E, for all the compensatory damages in respect of one accident or occurrence other than as provided under Defense, Settlement, Supplementary Payments.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rdquo; are insured for claims made against &ldquo;you&rdquo; arising from:</P>
<P>1. <BOLD>Personal Liability</BOLD>&mdash;&ldquo;legal liability&rdquo; arising out of &ldquo;your&rdquo; personal actions anywhere in the world.</P>
<P>&ldquo;You&rdquo; are not insured for claims made against &ldquo;you&rdquo; arising from:</P>
<P>(a) the ownership, use or operation of any motorized vehicle, trailer or watercraft, except those for which coverage is shown in this policy;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>SPECIAL LIMITATIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Motorized Vehicles</TI>
<P><BOLD>Vehicles You Do Not Own:</BOLD> &ldquo;You&rdquo; are insured against claims arising out of &ldquo;your&rdquo; use or operation of any self-propelled land vehicle, amphibious vehicle or air cushion vehicle, including their trailers which &ldquo;you&rdquo; do not own, provided that:</P>
<P>1. the vehicle is not required to be registered under any government authority and it is designed primarily for use off public roads;</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at para. 7, Exhibit Book at tab 1, p. 2; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, pp. 27-28.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. The Dirt Bike is both a motor vehicle within the meaning of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (the &ldquo;<EM>HTA</EM>&rdquo;) and an off-road vehicle within the meaning of the <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c O.4 (the &ldquo;<EM>OVA</EM>&rdquo;). It is required to be registered.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, ss. 1(1) and 7(1) [<EM>HTA</EM>], Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tabs B1 and B2.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.4, s. 1 [<EM>OVA</EM>], Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B5.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Operation of Off-Road Vehicles on Highways</EM>, O. Reg. 316/03, s. 16, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. Given that the Dirt Bike was required to be registered, the Policy excludes coverage for the use or operation of the Dirt Bike. The Applicant therefore takes the position that it does not owe a duty to defend and indemnify the Respondent in the Action.</P>
<P>12. The Respondent reported the accident when he was served with the Statement of Claim in May, 2015.

<P>13. In or about June, 2015, the Appellant appointed counsel to defend the Respondent in the action and a Statement of Defence and Crossclaim and Jury Notice were served and filed on his behalf.

<P>14. In or around January, 2016, Ms. Morel was asked by counsel for the plaintiff to advise if there were any coverage issues. This inquiry was passed to Commonwell. Commonwell obtained a coverage opinion.

<P>15. Commonwell wrote to the Respondent on March 7, 2016 advising that there was no coverage under the Policy and that the within Application would be brought for a declaration that there was no duty to defend or indemnify him in the action.

<P>16. At the time that coverage was denied, pleadings had been exchanged in the Action. However, affidavits of documents had not been exchanged and examinations for discoveries had not yet been conducted.

<P>17. Commonwell states that the issues are as follows:
<P1>(a) Were the reasons given for the decision adequate?
<P2>(i) Should there have been a finding that there was no coverage?</P2>
<P2>(ii) Should there have been a distinction between waiver and estoppel?</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) Is the Respondent entitled to both defence and indemnity?</P1>

<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>Should there have been a finding that there was no coverage?</TI>
<P>18. In His Honour's reasons, he states that &ldquo;it seems highly probable that at the moment of the accident, the Dirt Bike was a vehicle that required registration&rdquo;. However, there is no finding as to whether there is coverage for the Dirt Bike in question. Ultimately, His Honour states that he &ldquo;might well have found that the operation of an unregistered vehicle on a roadway or highway fell within the exclusionary language&rdquo; but did not do so because it was found that the Appellant was bound to provide coverage due to waiver and estoppel.

<P>19. The Appellant respectfully submits that if the Policy provides coverage, the issues of waiver and estoppel are irrelevant as there is a duty to defend and indemnify. The issues of waiver and estoppel only arise if there is no duty to defend or indemnify pursuant to the Policy.</P>
<P>20. The Appellant submits that in this case, the Policy does not provide coverage and accordingly, there is no duty to defend or indemnify.</P>
<P>21. The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify in that it is triggered when there is a mere possibility that the claim, if successful, would require the insurer to indemnify the insured. There is no duty to defend if the claim clearly falls outside the scope of coverage.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nichols v. American Home Assurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 801</CITE><PARANUM>16-17</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>72 O.R. (2d) 799</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab A7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Determining whether or not an insurer has a duty to indemnify is a three-step process. Specifically:
<P1>(a) First, the court must determine if the plaintiff's legal allegations are properly pleaded. That is, the court must decide the true nature of the claims. In this case, the Plaintiffs' claim in the Action is a claim for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident, allegedly caused in whole or in part by the negligence of the Respondent. The claim is based in the tort of negligence.</P1>
<P1>(b) Second, the court must determine if any claims are entirely derivative in nature. There are no derivative claims in the subject Action.</P1>
<P1>(c) Third, the court must determine if any of the properly pleaded, non-derivative claims could trigger an insurer's duty to defend.</P1>

<P>23. When the language of the policy is unambiguous, the court should give effect to the clear language, reading the contract as a whole. Where the language of a policy is ambiguous, the court should prefer interpretations that are consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties.

<P>24. Any remaining ambiguities shall be interpreted against the insurer, pursuant to the <EM>contra proferentem</EM> rule. This generally means that coverage should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly.

<P>25. The language of the subject Policy is unambiguous. Therefore, the court should give effect to the clear language.</P>
<P>26. The initial grant of coverage is subject to exclusion clauses. The Policy excludes claims arising from the ownership, use or operation of any motorized vehicle, trailer or watercraft.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at para. 7, <EM>Exhibit</EM> Book at tab 1, p. 2; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, pp. 27-28.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. In <CASEREF><SOC>Silverthorne v. Gore Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered an exclusion clause identical to that within the subject Policy and found no ambiguity in the word &ldquo;use&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;ownership, use or operation&rdquo; within this exclusion clause has been interpreted to require some element of control in relation to the vehicle by the insured.

<P>28. The allegations against the Respondent as set out in paragraph 19 of the Plaintiffs' Statement of Claim arise out of the Respondent's use and operation of the subject Dirt Bike. The allegations in the Statement of Claim are clearly related to the Respondent's alleged control over the vehicle within the meaning of the exclusion clause.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at Exhibit A, Exhibit Book at tab 1A, pp. 6&ndash;20; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, p. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. The Policy does not explicitly define &ldquo;motorized vehicle&rdquo; to include a Dirt Bike. In <CASEREF><SOC>Red River Valley Mutual Insurance Co. v. Rockola</SOC></CASEREF> [<EM>Rockola</EM>], the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench considered an exclusion clause identical to that within the subject Policy. It concluded that the exclusion clause would apply to the operation of a Dirt Bike, unless the insured qualified for one of the exceptions to the exclusion clause. It was accepted that the Dirt Bike was a &ldquo;motorized vehicle&rdquo; pursuant to the exclusion clause.

<P>30. The Respondent admitted on cross-examination that the Dirt Bike was motorized.
<P1><BOLD>The Transcript of the Cross Examination of Shayne Campbell at p. 38, Line 25 and p. 39, lines 1-2, Exhibit Book at tab 4, pp. 301-302; Appeal Book <EM>and</EM> Compendium at tab 5, pp. 24-25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. Accordingly, it is the Applicant's position that the Plaintiff's claim arises from the Respondent's use and operation of a motorized vehicle. The Action therefore falls under the exclusion clause.</P>
<P>32. The exclusion clause is subject to exceptions, which would bring an excluded claim back within coverage. One such exception is claims arising from the insured's use or operation of any self-propelled land vehicle that is not owned by the insured. However, the exception only applies if certain conditions are satisfied. One of these conditions is that the vehicle is not required to be registered under any government authority.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at para. 7, Exhibit Book at tab 1, p. 2; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, p. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. A similar, albeit arguably more narrow exception and condition was considered in <EM>Rockola</EM>. In that case, the policy required the vehicle to be &ldquo;not subject to motor vehicle registration.&rdquo; Manitoba legislation defined a Dirt Bike as an off-road vehicle, which was subject to registration under their <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM> but not their <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>. Based on this, the insured claimed that there was a distinction between motor vehicles and off-road vehicles, such that the phrase &ldquo;motor vehicle registration&rdquo; in the policy did not include off-road vehicle registration.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rockola</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 29 at paras. 10, 17, and 25, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab A10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench disagreed. It held that a Dirt Bike was propelled by an internal combustion engine and was a motor vehicle. The fact that registration was under the <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM> did not turn the Dirt Bike into something other than a motor vehicle, in the ordinary sense of that word. It concluded that the phrase &ldquo;motor vehicle registration&rdquo; encompassed vehicles subject to registration under both the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM> and the <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM>. The claim was therefore excluded from coverage, which decision was upheld on appeal by the Manitoba Court of Appeal.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rockola</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 29 at paras. 21, 26, and 35, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab A10.</BOLD></P1>

<P>35. In this case, the exception refers to registration under any government authority, not simply motor vehicle registration.</P>
<P>36. Under Ontario legislation, a Dirt Bike is both a motor vehicle and an off-road vehicle. If operated on a highway, it is required to be registered under the <EM>HTA</EM>. Pursuant to the wording of the subject Policy, the Dirt Bike is required to be registered under a government authority. Therefore, the condition is unsatisfied, the exception does not apply and the claim is excluded from coverage.</P>
<P>37. The <EM>HTA</EM> defines &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; as:
<QUOTE><P>an automobile, a motorcycle, a motor assisted bicycle unless otherwise indicated in this Act, and any other vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power, but does not include a street car or other motor vehicle running only upon rails, a power-assisted bicycle, a motorized snow vehicle, a traction engine, a farm tractor, a self-propelled implement of husbandry or a road-building machine;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>HTA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 1(1), Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. The Dirt Bike is propelled by a motorized engine, not muscular power. It falls under the category of &ldquo;any other vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power.&rdquo; It does not fall within the list of exceptions to that general category. The Dirt Bike is clearly a motor vehicle.</P>
<P>39. As a motor vehicle, the Dirt Bike was required to have a valid permit if it was operated on a highway, pursuant to section 7(1) of the <EM>HTA</EM>.
<P1><BOLD><EM>HTA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 7(1), Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. The term &ldquo;highway&rdquo; is defined in the <EM>HTA</EM> to include:
<QUOTE><P>a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>HTA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 1(1), Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The Dirt Bike was operated on Ridge Road. The Respondent admitted on cross-examination that Ridge Road was used by cars. The Applicant takes the position that Ridge Road was therefore a highway within the meaning of the <EM>HTA</EM> because it was a street used by the general public for the passage of vehicles.
<P1><BOLD>The Transcript of the Cross Examination of Shayne Campbell at p. 39, lines 6&ndash;8, Exhibit Book at tab 4, p. 302; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. As a motor vehicle operated on a highway, section 7(1) of the <EM>HTA</EM> creates a registration requirement for the Dirt Bike. The exception to the exclusion clause cannot apply because one of the necessary conditions is unfulfilled. The Plaintiffs' claim therefore falls under the exclusion clause.</P>
<P>43. The Dirt Bike can also be an off-road vehicle. For the purposes of the <EM>HTA</EM> and pursuant to section 191.8 (5) of that Act, an &ldquo;off-road vehicle&rdquo; means an off-road vehicle within the meaning of the <EM>OVA</EM>, which defines &ldquo;off-road vehicle&rdquo; as:
<QUOTE><P>a vehicle propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power or wind and designed to travel,</P>
<P>(a) on not more than three wheels, or</P>
<P>(b) on more than three wheels and being of a prescribed class of vehicle;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>HTA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 191.8(5), Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B3.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>OVA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 1, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. The Dirt Bike has two wheels. It is motorized and is neither propelled by muscular power or wind. It is therefore also an off-road vehicle within the meaning of the <EM>OVA</EM> and the <EM>HTA</EM>.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Convery Affidavit</EM> at Exhibit D, Exhibit Book at tab 1D, pp. 66-67; Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6, p. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. Section 191.8(1) of the <EM>HTA</EM> provides that no person shall drive an off-road vehicle on a highway except in accordance with the regulations and any applicable municipal by-laws.
<P1><BOLD><EM>HTA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 191.8(1), Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. Section 16 of the <EM>Operation of Off-road Vehicles on Highways</EM>, a regulation enacted under the authority of the <EM>HTA</EM>, provides:
<QUOTE><P>16 (1) The off-road vehicle shall not be operated on a highway unless a permit under section 5 of the <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM> has been issued in respect of that vehicle and a number plate showing the number of the permit is displayed on the vehicle as required under that Act.</P>
<P>(1) Subsection (1) does not apply to an off-road vehicle operated under the authority of a permit issued under section 7 of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>, as provided by section 7 of the <EM>Off-Road Vehicles Act</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Operation of Off-Road Vehicles</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 10 at s. 16, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab B6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. As an off-road vehicle operated on a highway, this regulation creates a registration requirement for the Dirt Bike. Again, the exception to the exclusion clause cannot apply because one of the necessary conditions is unfulfilled. The Plaintiffs' claim therefore falls under the exclusion clause.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(ii)</N><TI>Should there have been a distinction between waiver and estoppel?</TI>
<P>48. It is respectfully submitted that His Honour erred in not distinguishing between waiver and estoppel in the Reasons for Decision.</P>
<P>49. At the outset of the Reasons, it is stated that Commonwell is &ldquo;estopped from denying coverage&rdquo;. Ultimately, however, His Honour held that &ldquo;either waiver or estoppel will apply&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 5899</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 42</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, pp. 10 and 17.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. Commonwell submits that the Reasons do not distinguish between waiver and estoppel and as articulated further below, that these are separate and distinct legal doctrines that must be applied separately.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(b)</N><TI>Is the Respondent entitled to both defence and indemnity?</TI>
<P>51. His Honour's reasons state that Commonwell took the position that Mr. Campbell did not have consent to operate the Dirt Bike. Commonwell respectfully submits that the issue of consent was a live one on the pleadings in the Action, and states that through its counsel, it admitted that if there was otherwise coverage on the policy, this would give rise to a duty to defend, but depending on the outcome at trial, may not lead to a duty to indemnify. There were no submissions made at the hearing regarding when the issue of consent first arose.

<P>52. Commonwell submits that while it was open for his Honour to find that there was a duty to defend, there was insufficient evidence available for His Honour to find a duty to indemnify.</P>
<P>53. Depending on the findings at trial, it may be that there is no duty to indemnify for reasons other than those raised at the hearing of the Application. These would be new issues that may need to be litigated separately.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(c)</N><TI>Does Waiver Apply?</TI>
<P>54. Commonwell submits that waiver cannot apply because there was no finding of an express waiver in writing.</P>
<P>55. The test for waiver requires evidence that the party waiving had:
<P1>(a) A full knowledge of its rights; and</P1>
<P1>(b) An unequivocal and conscious intention to abandon them.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 S.C.R. 490</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>155 A.R. 321</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Saskatchewan River</EM>], Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab A14.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. In <EM>Saskatchewan River</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that no consideration moves from the party in whose favour a waiver operates. An overly broad interpretation of waiver would undermine the requirement of contractual consideration.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Saskatchewan River</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 55 at para. 20, Book of Authorities of the Appellant at Tab A14.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. During the relevant time between May, 2015, when the Respondent was served with the Statement of Claim in the Action and March 7, 2016 when the Applicant denied coverage, section 131(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, section 131(1) specifically provided that no term or condition of a contract shall be deemed to be waived by the insurer in whole or in part unless the waiver was stated in writing and signed by a person authorized for that purpose by the insurer. This section was only repealed and replaced on July 1, 2016, after the within Application was issued.

<P>58. It is notable that the Policy is a contract. Its terms and conditions also speak to waiver. It states at Section 10 of the Additional Conditions that Commonwell &ldquo;shall not be deemed to have waived any term or condition of this policy in whole or in part, unless [the] waiver is clearly stated and in writing, and is signed by a person authorized to do so&rdquo;...

Commonwell submits that in Economical it was found that there was a written waiver.

<P>60. Commonwell submits that waiver must be clear and unambiguous and that the Court has found in the past, that simply retaining counsel for an insured, even if a Notice of Intent to Defend or Statement of Defence is filed, is insufficient to establish waiver.

<P>62. His Honour held that the Action had proceeded to discoveries when the first inquiries were made as to coverage issues.

<P>65. This case is distinguishable from situations where a defence was provided through discovery and settlement negotiations. The Appellant submits that the issue of coverage was communicated to the Respondent early in the litigation, a legal Application was initiated and that the Respondent had the benefit of independent legal counsel almost since the outset of the underlying litigation. Accordingly, it submits that prejudice cannot be presumed.</P>
<P>66. The Respondent did not provide any evidence of actual prejudice in this case and none was found in the Reasons for Decision.</P>
<P>67. Commonwell respectfully submits that estoppel does not apply because there was no detrimental reliance found on the part of the Respondent.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>68. Commonwell respectfully requests that this Court set aside the judgment of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and that judgment be granted as follows:

<P1>(b) Costs payable to Peel Mutual; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Such further and other relief as counsel for Commonwell may request and that this Honourable Court considers just.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;<UNDER>OVERVIEW STATEMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. At all material times, the Respondent, Shayne Campbell (&ldquo;Campbell&rdquo;), was insured under a policy of insurance with the Appellant, The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group (&ldquo;Commonwell&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. On April 28, 2013, Campbell was involved in an accident while he was riding a dirt bike. As a result of that accident, Evan Rodger (the &ldquo;Plaintiff&rdquo;) issued a Statement of Claim in Ottawa as Court File No. 15-65061 (the &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;), naming Campbell as a Defendant, and served Campbell with the Statement of Claim in April 2015.</P>
<P>3. Campbell advised Commonwell of the Claim. In June 2015, Commonwell appointed counsel to defend Campbell in the Claim and pleadings were served on Campbell's behalf.</P>
<P>4. Commonwell did not serve a reservation of rights letter nor did Campbell sign a non-waiver agreement. In fact, no issue as to coverage was raised at all.</P>
<P>5. Notwithstanding the above, during the course of litigation, Commonwell informed Campbell that it would no longer cover the Claim relying solely on facts that were plain and obvious in the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>6. Commonwell brought an application seeking a declaration that it was not obliged to defend or indemnify Campbell, which application was heard May 29, 2018.</P>
<P>7. In his decision of October 4, 2018, Justice MacLeod held that Commonwell both waived its right to deny coverage and was also estopped from doing so. As such, Campbell was entitled to a defence and to be indemnified by Commonwell.</P>
<P>8. Commonwell appeals this decision.</P>
<P>9. Campbell states that Justice MacLeod had a full appreciation of the facts when undertaking his analysis of whether Commonwell owed Campbell a duty to defend and indemnification.</P>
<P>10. Commonwell has failed to demonstrate that Justice MacLeod made any palpable and overriding error with regards to facts or inferences from same, or that he was incorrect on questions of law. In the circumstances, there is no basis upon which to overturn the decision of Justice MacLeod and this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs to Campbell.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;<UNDER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. Campbell accepts as correct the facts found at paragraphs 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 15 of Commonwell's Factum.</P>
<P>12. Campbell disagrees with the facts found at paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 12, and 16 of Commonwell's Factum.</P>
<P>13. In April 2015, Campbell was served with a Statement of Claim in which he was named as a defendant, upon receipt of which he immediately advised Commonwell, his home insurer, and Guarantee Company of North America (&ldquo;Guarantee&rdquo;), his auto insurer.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Affidavit of Shayne Campbell</EM>, sworn April 24, 2017 (&ldquo;<EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 2, 13 and Exhibits A and D, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 2, 2A, 2D, pp. 87 and 90, 95&ndash;109 and 216&ndash;223; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 1, 2, 3, pp. 2 and 5, 10&ndash;24 and 25&ndash;32.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim states:
<QUOTE><P>The Defendant, Shayne Campbell (&ldquo;Campbell&rdquo;) is an individual residing in the Township of Champlain, in the County of Prescott-Russell, Ontario. At all material times, Campbell was the operator of a Red 2001 Honda R4C off road dirt bike owned by the Defendants John William Russell and/or RCOMM Radio Inc. as described in Ontario Motor Vehicle Accident Report Accident Number 3513-00234 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Red Honda&rdquo;).</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at Exhibit A, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tab 2A, p. 101; Respondent's Compendium at Tab 2, p. 16.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. In June 2015, Commonwell appointed Louise Morel (&ldquo;Morel&rdquo;) to defend the Claim on Campbell's behalf.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at para. 14 and Exhibit E, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 2, 2E, pp. 90-91, 224&ndash;237; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 1, 4, pp. 5&ndash;6, 33&ndash;46.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. Also, in June 2015, Guarantee's adjuster met with Campbell to take a statement. Thereafter, Guarantee asked Campbell to sign a Non-Waiver agreement and subsequently sent a Reservation of Rights letter.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at para. 13 and Exhibit D, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 2, 2D, pp. 90-91, 216&ndash;223; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 1, 3, pp. 5-6, 25&ndash;32.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. In July 2015, Campbell then met with Commonwell's adjuster, who also took a statement. The statement includes the following:
<QUOTE><P>I took John's red Honda XR400 dirt bike-it's a 2001. The bike isn't insured for the road that I was aware of. It's very basic-it's strictly off road. There aren't any mirrors or turn signals or a plate.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Affidavit of Pamela J. Duminy</EM>, sworn January 18, 2018 (&ldquo;<EM>Duminy Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;) and Exhibit B, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 3, 3B, pp. 246&ndash;248, 253; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 6, 8, pp. 50&ndash;52, 57.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Commonwell did not send a reservation of rights letter nor a non-waiver agreement as no issue as to coverage was ever raised. Instead, on August 17, 2015, Morel filed a Statement of Defence, Crossclaim, and Jury Notice. The Statement of Defence alleges as follows at paragraphs 4 and 5:
<QUOTE><P>4. Campbell...was operating the red 2001 Honda R4C off-road dirt bike...owned by the Defendants... in full conformity with all of the laws and regulations relating to the use and operation of motorized and off-road vehicles....</P>
<P>5. ...he was travelling westbound on Ridge Road...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at para. 14 and Exhibit E, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 2, 2E, pp. 91, 226; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 1, 4, pp. 6, 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. There was no suggestion that the defence was restricted or qualified in any way.</P>
<P>20. On March 7, 2016, Commonwell wrote to Campbell stating that the Claim would no longer be covered because the Policy contained an exclusion. Specifically, the denial letter states:
<QUOTE><P>In the statement of claim the plaintiffs allege that you were negligent in the operation of a red 2001 Honda R4C off road dirt bike....causing personal injury.</P>
<P>You are insured... provided that the vehicle is not required to be registered...</P>
<P>The 2001 Honda R4C off road dirt bike... was required to be registered...</P>
<P>Accordingly, there is no coverage...Commonwell will be bringing an Application.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at para. 19 and Exhibit H, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 2, 2H pp. 92, 243&ndash;245; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 1, 5, pp. 7, 47&ndash;49.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Affidavit of Iain Convery</EM>, sworn August 2, 2016 at para. 13 and Exhibit F, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tabs 1, 1F, pp. 5, 82&ndash;85; Respondent's Compendium at Tabs 9, 10, pp. 72, 74&ndash;76.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The Application was launched in August 2016 and was not heard until May 29, 2018. By the time of hearing, pleadings had been exchanged in the underlying Claim and all parties had been examined for discovery. A timetable was set requiring the matter to have been mediated by December 15, 2017.

<P>22. Campbell will suffer prejudice if Commonwell is allowed to now withdraw from coverage.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Campbell Affidavit</EM> at para. 20, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tab 2, p. 92; Respondent's Compendium at Tab 1, p. 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. In his Reasons for Judgment, Justice MacLeod concluded that Commonwell owed Campbell a duty to defend and an obligation to indemnify on the following basis:
<P1>a) Commonwell retained Morel as counsel to defend the action and a detailed statement of defence was delivered;</P1>
<P1>b) All the facts on which Commonwell now purports to rely to deny coverage were readily apparent at the time this was done;</P1>
<P1>c) Campbell was never told of any issue with coverage, he was never asked to sign a non-waiver, and he was never given a reservation of rights letter;</P1>
<P1>d) At the time the statement of defence was filed, Campbell was aware of these documents as he had been provided these documents by his auto insurer, Guarantee. Campbell understood that Morel was his lawyer and that Commonwell was defending him. Campbell relied upon these facts and did not follow up with his own counsel or Guarantee;</P1>
<P1>e) Commonwell only wrote to Campbell to advise there was no coverage once litigation was well advanced;</P1>
<P1>f) It would have been unfair to allow Commonwell to abandon Campbell at that stage and it is too late for Commonwell to deny coverage;</P1>
<P1>g) Prejudice may be presumed where the insurer persisted in the defence of the claim;</P1>
<P1>h) Either waiver or estoppel would apply to prevent Commonwell from denying coverage.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 5899</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Compendium at Tab 12, pp. 118&ndash;126.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. Justice MacLeod correctly concluded that Commonwell either waived or was estopped from denying a defence and indemnification to Campbell. Justice MacLeod fully appreciated the facts and applied the proper tests in a manner consistent with the case law in arriving at this decision.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;<UNDER>CAMPBELL'S POSITION RE: COMMONWELL'S ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. Commonwell states that the issues are as follows:
<P1>a) Were the reasons given for the decision adequate?</P1>
<P1>b) Is the Respondent entitled to both defence and indemnity?</P1>
<P1>c) Does waiver apply?</P1>
<P1>d) Does estoppel apply?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>A</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Were the reasons given for the decision adequate</EM>?</TI>
<P>26. Inadequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for appeal, as was confirmed by Justice Rothstein in <CASEREF><SOC>C. (R.) v McDougall</SOC></CASEREF>. Notwithstanding, the reasons given by Justice MacLeod for his decision were adequate. If a judge's reasons reveal the path the judge took to reach a conclusion on the matter in dispute, the reasons are adequate for the purposes of appellate review.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>C. (R.) v. McDougall</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>97</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>[2008] 3 S.C.R. 41</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>McDougall</EM>], Respondent's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;RBOA&rdquo;) at Tab A1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Commonwell's Notice of Application states that the Application is for &ldquo;A declaration and Order that it is not obligated to provide a defence or indemnity to the respondent in Ontario Superior Court of Justice action no. 15-64061 commenced in Ottawa (&ldquo;the Action&rdquo;).&rdquo; Commonwell was not seeking a declaration that the allegations contained in the Action fell within the exclusionary language of the Policy.
<P1><BOLD>Notice of Application issued March 11, 2016; Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant at Tab 4, p. 21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. Justice MacLeod states at paragraphs 27 and 28 of his decision the following:
<QUOTE><P>The application of the exclusion in the policy is not as clear as it may seem because of complexity in the interaction between the <EM>ORVA</EM>, Part X.3 of the <EM>HTA</EM> and various regulations and municipal by-laws which may provide exemptions permitting off-road vehicles to travel on the road.... Had circumstances been different, I might well have found that the operation of an unregistered vehicle on a roadway or highway fell within the exc lusionary language. I am unable to do so in this case because I have concluded that in the absence of a reservation of right, CMAG is obliged to provide coverage.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 5899</CITE><PARANUM>27-28</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Compendium at Tab 12, p. 122-123.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. After reviewing the law regarding waiver and estoppel, and applying those principles to the facts of the case, Justice MacLeod declared that Commonwell was obligated to provide a defence and to indemnify Campbell, in direct response to the request under the Notice of Application.</P>
<P>30. A judge is under a duty to provide adequate reasons. However, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>R v Walker</SOC></CASEREF>, such reasons will be sufficient &ldquo;if they are responsive to the case's live issues and to the parties.&rdquo; An appeal court cannot intervene simply because it believes that the trial judge did a poor job of expressing himself.
<P1><BOLD><EM>McDougall</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 26 at para. 99, RBOA at Tab A1.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R v. Walker</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 34</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>[2008] 2 S.C.R. 245</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, RBOA at Tab A2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. With regards to the applicability of the exclusion, Campbell states as follows. The Policy provides coverage to Campbell for vehicles he does not own provided that &ldquo;the vehicle is not required to be registered under any government authority and it is designed primarily for use off public roads.&rdquo; The clause is not ambiguous. No evidence has been tendered to suggest that when not on public roads, the Dirt Bike was required to be registered. Campbell provided a statement that the Dirt Bike was &ldquo;strictly off road&rdquo;. It is only if the dirt bike is operated on a highway, is it required to be registered under the HTA, and even then, as noted by Justice MacLeod, exceptions arise.
<P1><BOLD>Policy wording, Exhibit Book of the Appellant at Tab 1C, p. 50.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. For Commonwell's argument to be effective, the provision would have to be interpreted as &ldquo;not required to be registered <UNDER>under any circumstances</UNDER>.&rdquo; By Commonwell's logic then, there would be no coverage to Campbell had the accident occurred on private property. As such, the exclusion does not apply.</P>
<P>33. Justice MacLeod recognized same at paragraph 27 when he states, &ldquo;Unless it was being used solely on the owner's property, or fell under another exemption, it would have required a licence plate under the <EM>ORVA</EM>.... Nevertheless, it seems highly probable that <BOLD>at the moment of the accident</BOLD>, the dirt bike was a vehicle that required registration.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 5899</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Compendium at Tab 12, p. 122.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>B</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Is the Respondent entitled to both defence and indemnity</EM>?</TI>
<P>34. Justice MacLeod determined that Commonwell has waived its right and is estopped from denying coverage. It therefore flows that where coverage cannot be denied, the insurer must indemnify.</P>
<P>35. At a minimum, Commonwell is precluded from taking the position that it is not required to indemnify Campbell under the Policy for lack of consent or any applicable exclusion clause(s). With regards to consent, at no time has Commonwell advised Campbell that coverage may be denied on the basis of lack of consent and as such, is estopped from doing so for purposes of denying indemnification. As stated by Justice MacLeod at paragraph 26, &ldquo;In my view [Commonwell] could not have refused to defend the action based on lack of consent but it could have provided a defence under a reservation of rights. Of course, it did not do so.&rdquo; For Commonwell's argument to be effective, the provision would have to be interpreted as &ldquo;not required to be registered, <UNDER>under any circumstances</UNDER>&rdquo;. By Commonwell's logic then, there would be no coverage to Campbell had the accident occurred on private property.</P>
<P>36. As was the case in <CASEREF><SOC>Snair v Halifax Insurance Nationale-Nederlanden North America Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, Commonwell should be estopped from denying indemnification because of its course of conduct.

<BLOCK3><N><EM>C</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Does Waiver Apply</EM>?</TI>
<P>37. The doctrine of waiver prevents insurers from denying coverage after they have already started to defend the action on their insured's behalf. This doctrine requires no evidence of prejudice or detriment. Rather, Courts will apply the waiver doctrine if the following criteria are met:
<P1>(i) the insurer knew that its duty to defend and indemnify had not become operative because of a condition of the contract;</P1>
<P1>(ii) the insurer, nonetheless, took actions to defend the insured; and</P1>
<P1>(iii) the insurer did not enter into a non-waiver agreement with or issue a reservation of rights letter to the insurer.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Economical Insurance Group v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2008 CarswellOnt 26</CITE><PARANUM>31&ndash;34</PARANUM><COURTJUR>Ont. Sup. Ct.</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>163 A.C.W.S.

<P>38. Justice MacLeod notes the following with regards to waiver:
<P1>a) Where a breach has been waived, the insurer cannot later resile from such waiver (para 30);</P1>
<P1>b) Where a claim clearly falls outside the scope of insurance policy or falls within an exclusion or exception, the insurer should deny coverage clearly and unequivocally (para 31);</P1>
<P1>c) An insurer that proceeds to defend an action, or even an insurer which unequivocally states that it will defend an action, may be taken to have waived reliance on the exclusion or it may be estopped from later denying coverage (para 32);</P1>
<P1>d) If the facts as pleaded clearly give rise to an exclusion and the insurer ignores it and proceeds to defend the action it may be deemed to have waived its right to rely on the exclusion (para 34).</P1>

<P>39. Commonwell's actions in light of the factual matrix, amounts to a waiver of its right to deny coverage, as its conduct met all three criteria for this doctrine.</P>
<P>40. Commonwell's carriage of the defence in the absence of a non-waiver agreement or reservation of rights letter constitutes a representation by conduct and amounts to a waiver of any right to deny coverage. The Court will infer that the insurer intentionally elected to relinquish its right to treat its obligation to defend as at an end and rather, it elected to treat its obligation as subsisting. That election, once made and communicated to the insured, is irrevocable.

<P>41. There can be no doubt that Commonwell and its representatives had full knowledge of its rights under the Policy. It is, after all, an insurer and its business is assessing claims and determining whether they are covered by the policies of insurance it has issued.</P>
<P>42. On August 14, 2015 Commonwell filed a statement of defence on behalf of Campbell. That was the equivalent of stating, in writing, &ldquo;We elect to defend&rdquo;.</P>
<P>43. As Justice Holland wrote in <CASEREF><SOC>Rosenblood Estate v. Law Society of Upper Canada</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>When a claim is presented to an insurer the facts giving rise to the claim should be investigated. If there is no coverage then the insured should be told at once and the insurer should have nothing further to do with the claim if it wishes to maintain its off-coverage position. If coverage is questionable the insurer should advise the insured at once and in the absence of a non -waiver agreement or of an adequate reservation of rights letter defends the claim at its risk. In the present case the insurer finally took an off-coverage position but... much too late.</P></QUOTE>

<P>44. The failure of Commonwell to take an off-coverage position and to continue to do so as the litigation ensued, was a continuing election that amounted to a waiver by conduct. Campbell need not prove prejudice in the case of waiver, but in any event, as Justice Holland noted in Rosenblood Estate, prejudice must be presumed where the insurer persisted in the defence through productions and discovery.

<BLOCK3><N><EM>D</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Does Estoppel Apply</EM>?</TI>
<P>45. Justice MacLeod at paragraph 36 of his decision clearly states that the principles of estoppel and waiver are distinct, stating, &ldquo;Quite apart from election or waiver, an insurer that provides a defence to the insured without a reservation of rights may be estopped from taking an off coverage position later in the litigation&rdquo;, and turned his mind to the analysis of estoppel discussed in the Court of Appeal case of Rosenblood.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 5899</CITE><PARANUM>36</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Compendium at Tab 12, p. 124.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. The Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed that two requirements must be fulfilled for estoppel to apply in these circumstances:
<P1>(i) there must be knowledge on the part of the insurer of the facts that indic ated a lack of coverage, and</P1>
<P1>(ii) there must be a course of conduct by the insurer upon which the insured relied to its detriment.</P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rosenblood</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 43 at paras. 53-54, RBOA at Tab A6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. The contract of insurance is one that calls for utmost good faith. The details of the use of the dirt bike were clearly alleged in the Statement of Claim. Whether or not it addressed its mind to the matter the insurer must, or should have known, that there was a potential application of an exclusion clause.</P>
<P>48. Silence or inaction will count as a representation if a legal duty shall have been owed by the representor to the representee to make a disclosure, or take steps, the omission of which is relied upon as created the estoppel. Such a relationship exists between an insured and its insurer.</P>
<P>49. Section 131(1)(b) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> prevents an insurer from denying coverage under an insurance policy once the insurer has conducted itself in a way that would cause the insured to believe that he was covered. It provides that:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>131.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>The obligation of an insured to comply with a requirement under a contract is excused to the extent that,
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the insurer's conduct reasonably causes the insured to believe that the insured's compliance with the requirement is excused in whole or in part, and the insured acts on that belief to the insured's detriment.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Insurance Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c I.8, s 131(1), RBOA at Tab B1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. Justice MacLeod determined that the Application was launched in August 2016, at the time the Application Record was delivered.</P>
<P>51. Commonwell should be estopped from denying coverage because it knew from a review of the statement of claim, or ought to have known, that Commonwell's Policy excluded coverage in these circumstances, yet defended and continued to defend Campbell.</P>
<P>52. Campbell has been prejudiced by Commonwell's conduct. By commencing and continu ing with the defence, Commonwell has denied Campbell the ability to select counsel of his own choosing, to select the wording of his Statement of Defence, to decline to file a Jury Notice, and to attempt to settle the action at an earlier stage of the litigation. Further, while being defended, he took no further steps to protect his interests, including making further efforts to secure a defence under any other policy of insurance.</P>
<P>53. The Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Ryan v Moore</SOC></CASEREF> set out the basis for detrimental reliance:
<QUOTE><P>Detrimental reliance encompasses two distinct, but interrelated, concepts: reliance and detriment. The former requires a finding that the party seeking to establish the estoppel changed his or her course of conduct by acting or abstaining from acting in reliance upon the assumption, <UNDER>thereby altering his or her legal position</UNDER>. If the first step is met, the second requires a finding that, should the other party be allowed to abandon the assumption, detriment will be suffered by the estoppel raiser because of the change from his or her assumed position... (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ryan v. Moore</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 38</CITE><PARANUM>69</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>[2005] 2 S.C.R. 53</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>., RBOA at Tab A7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. As noted by Professor Bruce MacDougall in <EM>Estoppel</EM>, a leading text on the topic, the loss of opportunity to take some legal steps because of a representation relating to proceedings is a &ldquo;reasonably straightforward detriment, though the legal step would h ave to have made a difference.&rdquo; The author quotes <CASEREF><SOC>McConnell v Aviva Insurance Co of Canada Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> with respect to this proposition, in which Ross J., of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, notes that:
<QUOTE><P>Had [the insured] been advised of a lack of coverage and potential personal exposure, he might have taken a very different approach to the lawsuit, perhaps retaining his own counsel to defend the case and/or negotiating a settlement for a lesser amount that the judgment that has now issued against him.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Bruce MacDougall, <EM>Estoppel</EM>, (Markham: LexisNexis, 2012) at pp. 260-261, RBOA at Tab A8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. At paragraph 40 of his decision, Justice MacLeod determined that in March 2016, when Commonwell first advised Campbell that it was denying coverage, &ldquo;By that time not only had Guarantee denied coverage but the litigation was well advanced.&rdquo;, having earlier found at paragraph 8, &ldquo;It appears the main action had proceeded to the stage of discoveries when Plaintiff's counsel asked defence counsel whether there was any issued abo ut coverage.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 5899</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>298 A.C.W.S. (3d) 163</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Compendium at Tab 12, p. 124.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. At paragraph 62 of its Factum, Commonwell relies on the November 14, 2016 Case Conference Form to state that Justice MacLeod made a palpable and overriding error in inferring that the litigation was well advanced. It is of note that though timelines were created for completion of steps in the litigation, there is nothing in the Form to suggest that the discoveries had not commenced, and/or certain affidavit of documents had been exchanged. What is clear, is that all of these steps, including mediation, were to have been completed well before this matter was heard in May 2018.

<P>57. Lastly, prejudice may be presumed if, in the circumstances, the insurer has persisted through steps of the defence. Justice MacLeod turned his mind to this concept at paragraph 37, when he stated:
<QUOTE><P>It has also been held that where the litigation is at an advanced stage, prejudice to the insured is inferred, estoppel applies and in that case there is not need to decide if the actions of the insurer also constitute waiver.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Standard of Review</UNDER></TI>
<P>58. Interference in a decision on an application regarding an insurer's duty to defend and indemnify is justified only if the Judge made an error of law, or misapprehended the evidence such that there is an overriding and palpable error. This standard is applicable to Justice MacLeod's factual findings regarding Commonwell's duty to defend and indemnify Campbell.</P>
<P>59. The &ldquo;palpable and overriding&rdquo; standard addresses both the nature of the factual error and its impact on the result.
<QUOTE><P>i. A &ldquo;palpable&rdquo; error is one that is obvious, plain to see or clear. Examples of &ldquo;palpable&rdquo; factual errors include findings made in the complete absence of evidence, findings made in conflict with accepted evidence, findings based on a misapprehension of evidence and findings of fact drawn from primary facts that are the result of speculation.</P>
<P>ii. An &ldquo;overriding&rdquo; error is an error that is sufficiently significant to vitiate the challenged finding(s) of fact. Where the challenged finding of fact is based on a constellation of findings, the conclusion that one or more of those findings is founded on a &ldquo;palpable&rdquo; error does not automatically mean that the error is also &ldquo;overriding&rdquo;. The appellant must demonstrate that the error goes to the root of the challenged finding of fact such that the fact cannot safely stand in the face of that error.</P>
<P>iii. A &ldquo;palpable and overriding error&rdquo; has been interpreted as requiring a decision to be &ldquo;clearly wrong&rdquo; in the sense of being &ldquo;not reasonably supported by the evidence&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE>

<P>60. While it is not disputed that the interpretation of insurance contracts and errors of law are generally reviewed on a standard of correctness, motions regarding an insurer's duty to defe nd are not limited to the interpretation of an insurance contract. Rather, the dominant inquiry on such a motion is the breadth of the pleadings and the nature of the allegations, in which facts must be assumed to be true and the causes of action flowing from those facts must be assessed. Furthermore, this matter also raised the issue of waiver and estoppel.</P>
<P>61. The appropriate standard of review on an appeal of a decision regarding an insurer's duty to defend is a standard of palpable and overriding error. A motion judge's principal focus is:
<QUOTE><P>...not to interpret the terms of the insurance contract, but rather to assess the pleadings in order to ascertain the substance and true nature of the cla im, and whether it could give rise to liability within the policy coverage. In this, Justice Beveridge's Inquiry involved a question of mixed fact and law, and one which was heavily weighted towards the facts. His decision is owed considerable deference. Absent palpable and overriding error we will not intervene...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ING Insurance Company of Canada v. SREIT (Park West Centre) Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2009 NSCA 38</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM><CORRELAT><CITE>176 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1142</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>ING</EM>], RBOA at Tab A12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. Identifying the nature of the judge's error is the first task. An appellate court must identify a crucial flaw in the decision. Doubting the soundness of the judge's findings of fact arising from same, is not a recognized ground of appellate intervention.
<P1><BOLD><EM>ING</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 61 at para 20, RBOA at Tab A12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. An Appellate Court also determines whether the inferences drawn by the judge are reasonably supported by the evidence. If the facts or inferences drawn by the judge are reasonably supported by the evidence, the appellate court cannot reweigh the evidence by substituting, an equally, or even more persuasive conclusion.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Housen</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 59 at paras. 21-22, RBOA at Tab A9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. The Appellant must point to specific errors in the reasons, which justifies the conclusion that the judge failed or improperly considered the evidence or made improper inferences. Commonwell has failed to precisely articulate these errors, if any.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Housen</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para. 59 at para. 20, RBOA at Tab A9.</BOLD></P1></P>

<P>1. Mr. Campbell's Bill of Costs indicates that Ms. Powell's hourly rate is $375.00. The Information Notice to the Profession indicates that the maximum hourly rate for a lawyer of Ms. Powell's experience is $300 per hour. Adjusted for inflation, this amount would be at a maximum $370 per hour. This is a maximum rate for lawyers of up to 20 years' experience. Commonwell submits that a more appropriate rate, on a full indemnity basis, would be $350.00 per hour.</P>
<P>2. Counsel for Mr. Campbell, Ms. Powell billed 60.40 hours at a rate of $375. Commonwell submits that at an hourly rate of $350, in keeping with the Information Notice to the Profession, the total amount would be <UNDER>$22,650.</UNDER></P>
<P>3. The Information Notice to the Profession also limits law clerks to $80.00 per hour (approximately $98.00 with inflation) and students-at-law to $60.00 per hour (approximately $74.00 with inflation). Mr. Campbell seeks $130 and $150 respectively, which is significantly more than the maximum rate.</P>
<P>4. Mr. Campbell seeks compensation for a student-at-law who billed 23.80 hours at a rate of $150 per hour, totaling $3,525.

<BLOCK1><TI>COSTS SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT, SHAYNE CAMPBELL</TI>
<P>1. I n Reasons for Decision dated October 4, 2018, Justice MacLeod dismissed the Application brought by The Commonwell Mutual Assurance Group (&ldquo;Commonwell&rdquo;) against Shayne Campbell. That Application sought a declaration in favour of Commonwell that it is not obliged to provide a defence to Mr. Campbell, and indemnify him, in Court File No. 15-64061. Instead, Justice MacLeod declared that the Commonwell is required to provide Mr. Campbell with defence, indemnify him under its policy of insurance. Pursuant to a Costs Decision dated November 27, 2019, Justice MacLeod ordered that Commonwell pay Mr. Campbell's costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</P>
<P>2. Via this Appeal, Commonwell now seeks to have Justice Macleod's October 4, 2018 Decision set aside.</P>
<P>3. It is submitted that should Mr. Campbell be successful in this Appeal, he should be awarded costs on a <BOLD>full indemnity basis</BOLD>, in the amount of $33,089.68, inclusive of taxes and disbursements. Mr. Campbell's Bill of Costs is attached at <BOLD>Tab A</BOLD> including supporting dockets.</P>
<P>4. This Court has repeatedly affirmed that the basis for awarding costs against an insurer who has unsuccessfully denied coverage is on a full indemnity basis. This entitlement flows directly from the unique nature of the insurance contract which entails a duty to defend at no expense to the insured.

<P>5. As illustration, the Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Godonoaga (Litigation Guardian of) v Khatambakhsh</SOC><YEAR>2000</YEAR></CASEREF>, noted that:
<QUOTE><P>The appellants were entitled to a defence by their insurer without expense to them. Accordingly, that matter now having been determined in their favour, they should have their costs on a solicitor and his own client's scale for the defence of the main action and cross-claims until such time as the respondent insurer serves and files a notice of change of solicitors and takes over the insurers' defence. Such costs would include the conduct of the third-party proceedings and the motion before (the motion judge) and this appeal.</P></QUOTE>

<P>6. Mr. Campbell further submits that the amount of $33,089.68 is reasonable in view of the factors listed in Rule 57 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>7. Success in this Appeal was crucial to Mr. Campbell because the Plaintiff in the underlying accident suffered a catastrophic injury and is alleging damages in excess of $3,000,000. If Mr. Campbell were not to have been successful in response to the Application or this Appeal, he would have been personally liable for any awards made against him in the underlying action (Subrule 57.01(1)(d)).</P>
<P>8. Christine Powell has been practicing litigation, principally in the area of insurance law, since 2000. Given her experience, her hourly rate of $375 is appropriate in the Ottawa market. Attempts to minimize costs were extensive, in that law clerks and articling students were utilized for more routine tasks where possible (Subrule 57.01(1)(0.a)).</P>
<P>9. It is recognized that as a general rule, a successful party is entitled to costs of the Appeal and of the decision below. However, this Honourable Court has complete discretion in the matter of costs and may mould its order so as to do justice. Given Commonwell's position and the $3,000,000.00 being claimed in the underlying action, it is understandable that Campbell had no choice but to resist this Application. Should Commonwell prove successful on this Appeal, it is undeniable that Campbell will be faced with significant financial hardship, regardless of whether or not h is defence of the underlying action proves successful. It is therefore respectfully submitted that in the event that Commonwell is found successful on this Appeal, this Honourable Court should exercise its discretion, order no costs for this Appeal, and allow Justice MacLeod's November 27<SUP>th</SUP> Costs Decision to stand.</P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 16 day of August, 2019.</P>
