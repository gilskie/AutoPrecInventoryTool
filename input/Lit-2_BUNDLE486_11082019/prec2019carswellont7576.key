<BLOCK1><TI>CLAIM</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>PLAINTIFF</TI>
<P><P1>1. The plaintiff Christian Eduardo Gutierrez (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Gutierrez&rdquo;) resides in Calgary Alberta. At all material times Gutierrez was a member of the Jehovah's Witness Organization (&ldquo;a Witness&rdquo;). Gutierrez was sexually abused by another Witness when he was a minor.</P1>

<P2>i) prejudgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990, c.43, ss.128 and 129;</P2>
<P2>j) costs of this action on a complete indemnity basis;</P2>
<P2>k) such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE DEFENDANTS</TI>
<P><P1>3. The Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian religious organization (the &ldquo;Organization&rdquo;) that reports to have over 8,000,000 (eight million) members worldwide and over 113,500 (one hundred thirteen thousand five hundred) members in Canada.</P1>
<P1>4. In Canada, the Organization is run by a branch office of the worldwide organization known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Canada (the &ldquo;JW Canada&rdquo;) incorporated under the Canada <EM>Not-for-profit Corporations Act</EM>. JW Canada is the secular arm of the Organization in Canada for all purposes.</P1>
<P1>5. The defendant Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (&ldquo;JW New York&rdquo;) is the entity that controls the worldwide operations of the Jehovah's Witnesses. JW New York's head office <EM>is located at Warwick, New</EM> York.</P1>
<P1>6. JW New York establishes the policies and procedures in respect of the prevention and reporting of sexual abuse for Jehovah's Witnesses organizations worldwide, including Canada.</P1>
<P1>7. The defendant Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (&ldquo;JW PA&rdquo;) is the entity that The Pennsylvania Society assists the Governing Body, and is the principal corporation used to support the activities of the Witnesses.</P1>
<P1>8. The Plaintiff pleads that, by virtue of the acts described herein, each of the defendants is vicariously liable for the act and omissions of the others for the following reasons:
<P2>(a) Each was the agent of the other;</P2>
<P2>(b) Each defendant's business was operated so that it was inextricably interwoven with the business of the other;</P2>
<P2>(c) Each defendant entered into a common advertising and business plan with the other;</P2>
<P2>(d) Each defendant operated pursuant to a common business plan;</P2>
<P2>(e) Each defendant intended that the businesses be run as one business organization; and</P2>
<P2>(f) All or some of the defendants are related, associated or affiliated.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>CLASS MEMBERS</TI>
<P><P1>9. The Plaintiff brings this action on their own behalf and on behalf of the following subclasses:
<P2>a) All persons in Canada who were or are a Jehovah's Witness who allege having been sexually abused by a Jehovah's Witness Elder (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Elder Abuse Subclass&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P2>
<P2>b) All persons who were or are a Jehovah's Witness who allege having been sexually abused as a child (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Sexual Abuse Subclass</BOLD>).</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>DEFENDANTS' STRUCTURE</TI>
<P><P1>10. The Organization has a strict hierarchical structure controlled and directed by a committee called &ldquo;The Governing Body&rdquo; of the Organization. Ordinarily, the Governing Body is composed of 7 men.</P1>
<P1>11. The Governing Body is the ultimate decision making body for Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide. Jehovah's Witnesses have a presence in most countries.</P1>
<P1>12. The Governing Body is composed of a council of seven men, who meet at international headquarters is located in Warwick, New York. The Governing Body establishes all doctrines, administrative, disciplinary, and evangelical policies of the Organization based on its interpretations of the Bible.</P1>
<P1>13. The Governing Body appoints, directs and supervises Branch Offices in different countries that are responsible for overseeing the activities of Witnesses in each country and responsible for operating The Organization and publication and distribution of Watch Tower Society literature in each country.</P1>
<P1>14. Branch Offices supervise the administrative functions for Witness congregations of Kingdom Halls in their jurisdiction. The Defendant JW Canada is the Branch Office and spiritual and secular representative of the Organization in Canada. There are an estimated 1400 congregations in Canada.</P1>
<P1>15. Congregations meet in local buildings known as Kingdom Halls. More than one congregation may meet in any one Kingdom Hall.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>AUTHORITY OF ELDERS</TI>
<P><P1>16. As stipulated by the Governing Body, the congregation of each Kingdom Hall is governed and lead by a council composed of four to five Elders who are appointed by the Organization. Elders are completely responsible for congregational governance, pastoral work, setting meeting times, and selecting speakers, conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work, and forming judicial committees to investigate and decide all disciplinary action in cases where members are believed to have committed sins.</P1>
<P1>17. The remainder of each Kingdom Hall congregation consists of Witness members. Witnesses are required to provide absolute obedience, and defer to, the Elders in all matters.</P1>
<P1>18. The Governing Body has decreed that congregational judicial committees determine whether sirs have been committed by members.</P1>
<P1>19. The offences that constitute sins are identified in a book approved by the Governing Body and provided only to Elders titled &ldquo;Shepherd the Flock of God&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>20. Sexual abuse is a sin by the Organization.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>OBEDIENCE, DISCIPLINE and CONFIDENTIALITY</TI>
<P><P1>21. The Organization is insulated from mainstream society. The Organization discourages members from associating with non-Jehovah's Witnesses, from reporting crimes that involve other Witnesses to police, and prohibits Witnesses from suing other Witnesses.</P1>
<P1>22. Non-Jehovah's Witnesses are referred to as &ldquo;worldly&rdquo;. While appreciating that contact with worldly persons is inevitable at work, school and elsewhere all such contact is to be minimized. Witnesses are encouraged to associate with other Witnesses as much as possible.</P1>
<P1>23. Elders are granted enormous power over other Witnesses.</P1>
<P1>24. Elders form the judicial committee of each congregation that has the authority to discipline congregation members, including but not limited to disfellowship. Failure to follow the directions of congregation Elders can result in a member being disfellowshipped from the Organization and having all contact with family members and friends who are Witnesses cut off.</P1>
<P1>25. Disfellowshipped members are shunned by all other Organization members, including family, friends, acquaintances and work colleagues.</P1>
<P1>26. The Organization requires Witnesses and Elders to keep any offences or allegations (including allegations of sexual abuse) that involve a Witness absolutely confidential.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>SEXUAL ABUSE POLICIES</TI>
<P><P1>27. Organization policy established by the Governing Body requires Elders to keep a record of all allegations of sexual abuse by or against a Witness and to provide a report of the abuse to the Society Head Office. Records of sex abuse allegations by a Witness are to be kept indefinitely.</P1>
<P1>28. Organization policy prohibits Elders from reporting allegations of sexual abuse by or against a Witness to secular authorities. Instead the Organization requires that Elders report such allegations to the Organization legal department.</P1>
<P1>29. The Organization discourages Witnesses who are victims of sexual abuse from attending group therapy or counseling because it may breach the confidentiality demanded by the Organization of its members.</P1>
<P1>30. The Organization does not consider an allegation of sexual abuse to be legitimate or established unless or until there is a ruling by the congregation's judicial committee of Elders.</P1>
<P1>31. The Organization's policies seek to avoid or to delegate the responsibility to report suspected sexual abuse to the adult victim or, the event of suspected child abuse, to the child's parents or physicians, regardless of whether this policy is contrary to duties imposed by statute and common law.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>JUDICIAL COMMITTEES AND SEXUAL ABUSE</TI>
<P><P1>32. The Organization's policy and protocol for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse is seriously flawed and results in further harm to victims of sexual abuse and results in legitimate allegations of sexual abuse going unreported.</P1>
<P1>33. All allegations of wrongdoing within a congregation are dealt with by a judicial committee made up of Elders from the congregation.</P1>
<P1>34. Organization policy and protocol requires Witnesses who have been a victim of sexual abuse to confront their abuser (in person and in the presence of the members of the judicial committee.) The Organization knew or ought to have known the significant harm this policy could and did cause to vulnerable victims of sexual abuse.</P1>
<P1>35. Before a judicial committee is formed the Elders must first determine if the allegation has been &ldquo;established&rdquo;. The Organization does not consider there to be evidence of wrongdoing unless there is a confession or unless there are two or more eyewitnesses to the wrongdoing. According to Organization policy no action can be taken unless the allegation is established by two witnesses. The victim is considered a witness.</P1>
<P1>36. If a victim complainant cannot call upon another to attest to the alleged sexual abuse, he or she may be found to have committed slander and face disassociation from the congregation. Given the circumstances in which sexual assault is ordinarily committed, the Organization's policy effectively requires a confession from the assailant to prove the sexual assault allegation.</P1>
<P1>37. Because congregation members have little or no social support outside the Witness community, disassociation can cause serious harm to already vulnerable victims of sexual abuse.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>38. For decades the Organization knew or ought to have known about the damage and harm caused by sexual abuse. The Organization knew or ought to have known that its policy for establishing allegations of sexual abuse was flawed and harmful to victims of abuse and resulted in legitimate allegations of abuse not being investigated, pursued or reported to secular authorities.</BOLD></P1>
<P1>39. For decades the Organization has received thousands of reports of sexual abuse, including child sex abuse, and has failed to investigate and/or report the abuse to secular authorities, even where required by law.</P1>
<P1>40. The Organization's policies, as aforesaid, helped to conceal or ignore serious cases of sexual abuse.</P1>
<P1>41. The relationship between the Organization and congregation Elders is both spiritual and temporal. The Organization's actions created or materially increased the risk of harm to the Plaintiff and other class members.</P1>
<P1>42. It was reasonably foreseeable that the actions or inactions of the Organization could harm the Plaintiff and the class.</P1>
<P1>43. The Organization was in a relationship of proximity with the Plaintiff and the class by virtue of the power and authority the Organization and its Elders held over the class.</P1>
<P1>44. The Organization provides Elders with the opportunity to abase their power.</P1>
<P1>45. The Elder's wrongful acts were strongly related to the psychological intimacy inherent in their role as spiritual leaders of their congregations.</P1>
<P1>46. The Organization conferred an enormous degree of power on Elders and other officers relative to congregation members, including children.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>DETAILS OF THE PLAINTIFF'S ABUSE: GUITIERREZ</TI>
<P><P1>47. At all material times, Gutierrez was a child member of the Organization.</P1>
<P1>48. Gutierrez does not recall the Organization Congregation to which he belonged when he was a child.</P1>
<P1>49. Gutierrez was sexually assaulted by an Elder of the Congregation of JW Canada.</P1>
<P1>50. Gutierrez was so overwhelmed by the assault that he did not report it to anyone at the time, including his father who was also an Elder of the Congregation.</P1>
<P1>51. Gutierrez subsequently reported the assault to another Elder of the Congregation.</P1>
<P1>52. As a consequence of that report, a group of Elders attended at the home of Gutierrez and his parents.</P1>
<P1>53. Other than giving Gutierrez some Organization magazines, the Organization did not take any further steps arising from Gutierrez's report of the sexual assault.</P1>
<P1>54. Gutierrez's father was upset the Gutierrez reported the sexual assault to another Elder and not to him.</P1>
<P1>55. Gutierrez made another report the sexual assault to a Organization Circuit Overseer. Circuit Overseers are appointed to their positions by the defendant JW NY. It is the responsibility of Circuit Overseers to ensure that Congregations in their respective districts abide by the practices, policies and procedures enunciated by the Governing Board.</P1>
<P1>56. Gutierrez does not recall the full name of the said Circuit Overseer but recalls that he was originally from Quebec and that his surname was Daoust.</P1>
<P1>57. The Circuit Overseer brushed off Gutierrez's report of the sexual assault, saying &lsquo;that is in the past.&rsquo;</P1>
<P1>58. Gutierrez has received and continues to receive counseling as a consequence of the said sexual assault.</P1>
<P1>59. Gutierrez is no longer a member of the Organization.</P1>
<P1>60. Gutierrez pleads that the sexual abuse which he suffered, the Elders' failure to report and adequately address the abuse has caused him to develop certain psychological mechanisms in order to survive the trauma of the sexual abuse, including denial, repression, disassociation and guilt.</P1>
<P1>61. Gutierrez still does not understand/appreciate the full extent of the damage caused to him by the sexual assault committed by his abuser, the failure of Congregation Elders to adequately address the harm or report it to police, and the damages caused by same.</P1>
<P1>62. The Organization in each instance of sex abuse failed to protect Class Members given their vulnerability. The Organization through its failure to meet its duty of care, contributed to creating an environment in which pedophiles were able to sexually assault and abuse Gutierrez and the other Class Members.</P1>
<P1>63. The Organization owed Gutierrez and all Class Members, a duty of care and fiduciary duties.</P1>
<P1>64. The Representative Plaintiff claims and pleads that the Organization is directly liable to the class members for the harm directly caused by its flawed policies and processes and the manner in which allegations of sexual abuse are dealt with by the Organization.</P1>
<P1>65. The Representative Plaintiff claims and pleads that the Organization is vicariously responsible for the acts and conduct of its members, in this case, the Plaintiff and Class Members' abusers, and that the Organization is negligent:
<P2>a) By not reporting child abuse to police, by allowing known or accused abusers to remain in positions of trust and authority, and by creating an atmosphere of fear of sanctions for victims of abuse seeking to report their abuse to authorities, the Organization facilitated abusers' capacity to do wrong and continue to do wrong and, without that culture, the wrongs could not have been perpetrated against the Plaintiff and all Class Members;</P2>
<P2>b) The Organization knew or ought to have known about the cases of sexual abuse. Prior to the attacks upon the Representative Plaintiff and other class members, the Organization was aware or should have been aware that the abusers and other pedophiles, who were active members of the Organization, had engaged in illegal and abhorrent sexual practices with youth members of the congregation.</P2>
<P2>c) The Organization failed to adopt proper or adequate policies and practices to ensure that known abusers were reported to authorities or nor allowed to remain in the Organization's community where they were able to continue abusing their victims.</P2>
<P2>d) The Organization failed to fulfill its reporting obligations, sought to delegate the Organization's reporting obligations and failed to ensure that those to whom the Organization purported to delegate reporting responsibility fulfilled the reporting responsibility.</P2>
<P2>e) The Organization did not provide proper, adequate or effective training or monitoring, initially or on an ongoing basis, to ensure that Congregation members were suitable and fit to care for or to supervise children;</P2>
<P2>f) Such further and other particulars as may be advised prior to trial.</P2></P1>
<P1>66. In addition to the foregoing, the Representative Plaintiff claim that the Organization is vicariously liable and/or negligent for the acts and conduct of the abusers of the Representative Plaintiff and other Class Members by reason of:
<P2>a) failing to have proper or adequate, or any, policies relating to reporting or investigating claims of sexual abuse to the Organization;</P2>
<P2>b) failing to ensure that any such policies were followed and enforced;</P2>
<P2>c) failing to have proper or adequate, or any, policies for monitoring the activities of Organization members in positions of authority;</P2>
<P2>d) failing to have effective policies and procedures for determining whether sexual assaults had been perpetrated on Organization members by other Organization members;</P2>
<P2>e) failing to ensure that any such policies were followed and enforced;</P2>
<P2>f) failing to have proper or adequate, or any, policies to educate Congregation members, including child members, about sexual abuse;</P2>
<P2>g) failing to ensure that any such policies were followed and enforced;</P2>
<P2>h) failing to have proper or adequate, or any, policies for reporting sexual, abuse by Congregation members to public authorities;</P2>
<P2>i) failing to ensure that such policies were followed and enforced;</P2>
<P2>j) failing to properly supervise, control, monitor and give guidance to the Representative Plaintiff and the Class Members;</P2>
<P2>k) The Organization knew, or ought to have known of the actions of the persons who abused the Representative Plaintiff and took no steps to have the abusers removed from the Organization;</P2>
<P2>l) The Organization failed to provide leadership by implementing and enforcing guidelines on sexual abuse, thereby causing the Representative Plaintiff and the Class Members damages to begin, continue and become exacerbated.</P2>
<P2>m) The Organization failed to warn potential victims of sexual abuse, such as the Representative Plaintiff, that there was a risk that known child abusers might commit sexual assault; and</P2>
<P2>n) Such further and other particulars as may be advised prior to trial.</P2></P1>
<P1>67. Further, and in addition to the foregoing, the Representative Plaintiff claim vicarious liability against the Organization by reason of:
<P2>a) The Organization failing to provide regular, proper effective training, teaching guidelines or monitoring the Representative Plaintiff or minor Class Members adequately or at all, to ensure that tile Organization was operating in accordance with, and as an institution holding itself out as a religious organization;</P2>
<P2>b) The Organization failed to respond properly or take appropriate steps to protect potential victims, such as the Representative Plaintiff and other child Class Members, where information was obtained that Organization member child abusers were or might be committing sexual assaults. Furthermore, when the sexual assaults of other complainants by Congregation members were discovered, the Organization failed to undertake a fair investigation or otherwise ensure that there were no victims or perpetrators; and</P2>
<P2>c) such further and other particulars as may be advised prior to trial.</P2></P1>
<P1>68. The Plaintiff pleads that the Organization owed a duty to the Representative Plaintiff, and all Class Members to ensure that they were reasonably safe while in the care and custody of Congregation members.</P1>
<P1>69. As a result of the abuse, the Representative Plaintiff and the other Class Members have encountered a number of emotional and psychological difficulties. The have become alienated from their family members, and their relationships with others have been adversely affected because of the sexual abuse. The Representative Plaintiff and the other Class Members have suffered serious and permanent injuries and general and special damages for which the Organization is at law vicariously liable including:
<P2>a) ongoing severe emotional and psychiatric hospitalization and professional counseling which continues to this day;</P2>
<P2>b) numerous attempts at suicide;</P2>
<P2>c) inability to sleep;</P2>
<P2>d) recurring nightmares;</P2>
<P2>e) difficulty in developing and maintaining healthy and meaningful interpersonal relationships;</P2>
<P2>f) inability to trust other individuals;</P2>
<P2>g) emotional and mental distress;</P2>
<P2>h) low self esteem;</P2>
<P2>i) major depression;</P2>
<P2>j) failed relationships;</P2>
<P2>k) problems with authority figures leading to conflicts with employers;</P2>
<P2>l) lack of self confidence;</P2>
<P2>m) inability to complete formal education;</P2>
<P2>n) loss of income;</P2>
<P2>(o) substance abuse;</P2>
<P2>(p) physical pain;</P2>
<P2>(q) depression;</P2>
<P2>(r) mental anguish;</P2>
<P2>(s) loss of enjoyment of life;</P2>
<P2>p) such further and other damages as may be advised prior to trial.</P2></P1>
<P1>70. As a result of the assault upon their physical safely, integrity and mental well being, the experiences have left the Representative Plaintiff and each Class Member emotionally and mentally scarred.</P1>
<P1>71. As a consequence of these experiences the Representative Plaintiff and Class Members have been put to medical expense and will require therapy and medical attention.</P1>
<P1>72. The Plaintiff, therefore, submit that judgment be granted for the relief sought together with costs on a complete indemnity scale.</P1>
<P1>73. The Plaintiff propose that the within action be tried at the City of Toronto.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF MOTION</TI>
<P>The Defendants, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (&ldquo;WTPA&rdquo;) and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (&ldquo;WTNY&rdquo;), will make a motion (&ldquo;Motion&rdquo;) before The Honourable Justice Perell on May 2, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., or as soon after that time as the motion can he heard, at the court house, 393 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The Motion is to be heard orally.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. An Order:
<P1>(a) Striking the Tuovi Affidavits (as defined below) in their entirety; or</P1>
<P1>(b) In the alternative, striking the Improper Tuovi Content (as defined below); and</P1></P>
<P>2. The costs of the Motion; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Court may deem just, all without submission or attornment by WYNY or WTPA (the &ldquo;U.S. Defendants&rdquo;) to the jurisdiction of this Court.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. This Motion relates to the evidence delivered in respect of the motion of the U.S. Defendants challenging the jurisdiction of this Court in relation to the claims asserted against them. For greater certainty, the U.S. Defendants do not submit or attorn to the jurisdiction of this Court.</P>
<P>2. The plaintiff has delivered affidavits of Peter Tuovi sworn on August 3, 2018, January 2, 2019, and April 2, 2019 (collectively, the &ldquo;Tuovi Affidavits&rdquo;). Leave of this Court is required, but has not been obtained, to serve and file the Tuovi Affidavit sworn April 2, 2019.</P>
<P>3. Peter Tuovi is a partner in the law firm McPhadden Samac Tuovi, which is the firm of lawyers acting for the plaintiff in these proceedings.</P>
<P>4. The contents of the Tuovi Affidavits constitute the evidence of Bryan McPhadden, as each of the Touvi Affidavits states that &ldquo;[e]xcept where otherwise specifically indicated below, I am advised of the following by Mr. McPhadden and verily believe same to be true&rdquo;.</P>
<P>5. Bryan McPhadden is also a partner in the law firm McPhadden Samac Tuovi. Mr. McPhadden has carriage of this action on behalf of the plaintiff, and he is the sole listed counsel on the motions presently before the Court that are returnable August 2, 2019 (&ldquo;August Motions&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. The Tuovi Affidavits ought to be struck in their entirety because they are improper solicitors' affidavits and, further, it is improper for Bryan McPhadden to appear as counsel on his own affidavits. In the alternative, Mr. McPhadden is precluded from appearing at the oral hearing of the August Motions.</P>
<P>7. The Tuovi Affidavits are not limited to perceived facts but are replete with improper speculation, argument, conclusions, and opinions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following paragraphs of the Tuovi Affidavits are improper on this basis:
<P1>(a) Touvi Affidavit sworn August 3, 2018: Paragraphs 8-9, 12&ndash;14, 18&ndash;20, 22, 24, 29&ndash;33, 35, and 41;</P1>
<P1>(b) Tuovi Affidavit sworn January 2, 2019: Paragraphs 4, 6, 12-13, 16-17, 20&ndash;25, 28, 30&ndash;33, 35, 37&ndash;39, 41, 44&ndash;48, 52-53, 56&ndash;58, 62&ndash;64, 66-67, 69, 71, 73-74, 76&ndash;79, 81, 87&ndash;102, 104&ndash;107, 109-110, and 113; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Tuovi Affidavit sworn April 2, 2019: Paragraphs 9&ndash;14.</P1></P>
<P>8. The Tuovi Affidavit sworn January 2, 2019 improperly asserts contested facts on the information and believe from the plaintiff and proposed plaintiffs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 11, and 15 of the Tuovi Affidavit sworn January 2, 2019 are improper on that basis.</P>
<P>9. Leaving the Tuovi Affidavits on the record would be embarrassing and prejudicial to the fair hearing of the August Motions.</P>
<P>10. The substantial defects in the Tuovi Affidavits are such that they should be struck in their entirety pursuant to Rule 25.11 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. The substantial defects in the Tuovi Affidavits are intertwined with all other parts of the Tuovi Affidavits, making the entire documents defective.</P>
<P>11. In the alternative, if the Tuovi Affidavits are not struck out in their entirety, the paragraphs of the Tuovi Affidavits referred to within this Notice of Motion, together with all exhibits attached thereto (collectively, the &ldquo;Improper Tuovi Content&rdquo;), should be struck pursuant to Rule 25.11.</P>
<P>12. Rules 1.04, 4.06(2), 25.11, 37, 39, 57 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>13. Such further and other grounds as the lawyers may advise.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the Motion:
<P1>(a) The Tuovi Affidavits;</P1>
<P1>(b) The pleadings and proceedings herein;</P1>
<P1>(c) Such further and other evidence as the lawyers may advise and this Court may permit.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF PETER E. TUOVI (Sworn August 3, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, PETER E. TUOVI, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:
<P1>1. I am a lawyer in the law firm McPhadden Samac Tuovi, lawyers for the plaintiff herein and, as such, have knowledge of the matters to which I hereinafter depose. The lawyer at our firm with carriage of this action is Bryan C. McPhadden. Except where otherwise specifically indicated below, I am advised of the following Bryan C. McPhadden and verily believe same to be true.</P1>
<P1>2. The herein action is a proposed sex abuse action against a religious organization known as the Jehovah's Witnesses (&ldquo;JW Organization&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>3. Generally speaking, the primary allegation in the action is that the JW Organization failed to maintain adequate policies and procedures to prevent and address sexual abuse within the organization.</P1>
<P1>4. Amongst the asserted deficiencies in the policies and procedures is that they put the interests of the JW Organization ahead of sex abuse victims.</P1>
<P1>5. The alleged deficiencies include inadequate and ineffective policies and procedures for preventing sex abuse and reporting alleged sex abuse to public authorities.</P1>
<P1>6. Another assertion is that die organization does not accept the veracity of alleged victim's sex abuse allegations unless there were two witnesses to the abuse (the &ldquo;Two Witness Rule&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>7. The herein action was commenced by way of Statement of Claim issued September 26, 2017 a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>. A copy of the draft Amended claim is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>8. In preparing to commence this action, it was not an easy task to identify the JW Organization corporations to name as it was necessary to sort through the labyrinth of Jehovah's Witness corporations. The specific roles of individual JW Organization corporations are rarely found or, if found, stated. On the organization's website some specific corporations are identified though only brief and generalized descriptions of their roles are provided. By way of example, attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is the organization's webpage for the defendant Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. There, the organization notes:
<QUOTE><P>Besides the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (&ldquo;JWPA&rdquo;), Jehovah's Witnesses use dozens of legal entities in various countries.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>9. Relative to the overall control and administration of the JW Organization, the aforementioned webpage advises, in respect of JWPA, that:
<QUOTE><P>The corporation members and directors assist the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses (the &ldquo;Governing Body&rdquo;).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>10. As regards the Governing Body, JW Organization's website says:
<QUOTE><P>The Governing Body is a small group of mature Christians who provide direction for Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>11. The website further indicates that the Governing Body is composed of 8 men who serve at the JW Organization's world headquarters in Warwick, New York, United States. Attached to my affidavit and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a Copy of the webpage about the Governing Body.</P1>
<P1>12. The webpage relating to JWPA notes that the JW Organization use JWPA to support their worldwide work, which includes publishing Bibles and Bible-based literature. While JWPA's activities may be &ldquo;worldwide&rdquo;, there are JW Organization entities in many countries including Canada. The JW Organization's corporation in Canada is the defendant Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Canada (&ldquo;JWCan&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>13. The JW Organization's aforementioned website describes, in a very general way, the objectives of JWPA:
<QUOTE><P>According to its charter, the corporation's purposes are &ldquo;religious, educational, and charitable,&rdquo; in particular, to &ldquo;preach and teach the gospel of God's Kingdom under Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>14. The fact of the matter is that it is impossible for an outsider to determine the exact responsibilities of the &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of JW corporations. Conversely, it is impossible to determine which JW corporation is responsible for developing and enforcing the JW Organization's sex abuse policies and procedures.</P1>
<P1>15. A search of &ldquo;sex abuse&rdquo; on the JW organization's website does not disclose a responsible organization.</P1>
<P1>16. A search on the same website of the &ldquo;Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York&rdquo; (&ldquo;JWNY&rdquo;) (another defendant herein) does not result in a description of that corporation or its responsibilities and the search simply return to the above noted JWPA page.</P1>
<P1>17. JWPA was incorporated in New York State 1884. In 2001, it filed Articles of Amendment, a copy of which is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>. The Articles identify the corporation's objectives.</P1>
<P1>18. Also attached to my affidavit aid marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Charter for JWNY, updated to September, 2003. The purposes of JWNY stated therein are the same as for JWPA.</P1>
<P1>19. From the incorporating documents of JWPA and JWNY it is not possible to discern roles and responsibilities of the corporations within the JW Organization as directed by the Governing Body.</P1>
<P1>20. From our research, it appears that both JWPA and JWNY have some role in the development and implementation of the JW Organizations' sex abuse policies and procedures.</P1>
<P1>21. The JW Organization distributes its publication &ldquo;Awake!&rdquo;. On its website can be found articles appearing in previous editions. An example of such an article relating to sex abuse is titled &ldquo;If Your Child is Abused&rdquo;. A copy of that article is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD>. The header above the article suggests the article appeared in a 1993 edition of Awake!. From a notation at the end of the article it can be noted that JWP asserts a copyright relative to the article.</P1>
<P1>22. Based on the foregoing, our understanding was that the sex abuse policies of the JW Organization were previously established on a worldwide basis by either the defendant Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and/or the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.</P1>
<P1>23. When this action was commenced, we were unaware of the existence or role of a corporation by the name of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (&ldquo;CCJW&rdquo;). CCJW was incorporated in New York State on August 15, 2000. Attached to my affidavit and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation.</P1>
<P1>24. As may be noted from Article III in the Certificate of Incorporation, the proposed defendant CCJW has entirely the same stated purposes as do the existing defendants JWPA and JWNY.</P1>
<P1>25. A brief description of CCJW is found online at: <UNDER>https://wwwfacebook.com/pg/christiancongregation/about/?ref=page_Internal</UNDER> A copy of the page at that link is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD>. There, it stated:
<QUOTE><P>The Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses is a non-profit organization operating in various countries worldwide.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>The countries in which CCJW operates or whether it operates in Canada are not indicated there.</P1>
<P1>26. One of the CCJW letters posted on line is dated October 1, 2012, a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD>. It is addressed to All Bodies of Elders and is in reference to &ldquo;Child Abuse&rdquo;. The table of contents at the beginning of the letters discloses that &ldquo;child sexual abuse&rdquo; is one of the matters addressed therein. The first line of the letter says it updates 9 earlier letters to all bodies of elders regarding child abuse. Four of those letters pre-date incorporation of CCJW.</P1>
<P1>27. One of the 4 letters predating the incorporation of CCJW is said to be dated February 3, 1993. Found online is a letter bearing the same date said to be issued by JWNY and is in reference to &ldquo;victims of child abuse&rdquo; and includes discussion about &ldquo;sexual abuse.&rdquo; A copy of the said letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>28. Another of the letters predating CCJW's incorporation is said to be dated March 14, 1997. Found online is a JWNY letter bearing the same date, addressed To All Bodies of Elders and, as appears from the second paragraph of the letter, is about &lsquo;child sexual abuse&rsquo;. Attached to my affidavit and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the said letter dated March 14, 1997.</P1>
<P1>29. Also found online is a virtually identical letter of the same but issued by the &ldquo;Bible and Tract Society of Britain&rdquo;. Attached to my affidavit and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the said letter. The fact that a Jehovah's Witness organization in Britain is sending the same letter as that sent by JWNY suggests that JWNY prescribes what the British organization is to distribute to its Elders.</P1>
<P1>30. As, in its October 1, 2012 letter, CCJW is updating 4 letters previously issued by JWNY regarding child abuse, including those sent by JWNY, it now appears that CCJW has assumed at least some, and perhaps all, the JWNY's responsibilities for instructing Elders on the issue of sex abuse. In this regard it is also noteworthy that following the date of CCJW's first letter on sex abuse, no letters issued by JWNY on this issue of sex abuse can be located.</P1>
<P1>31. It now appears that in the early 2000's responsibility for such policies was transferred by the JW Organization to CCJW. Accordingly, to the extent there are deficiencies and defects in the sex abuse policies of the JW Organization, they are the responsibility of CCJW.</P1>
<P1>32. At the time this action was commenced we were not aware of the existence of CCJW and, therefore, not aware of the role it played or may have played as regards the JW Organizations sex abuse policies and procedures.</P1>
<P1>33. It appears that CCJW may also direct the affairs JWCan and other JW Organizations in other jurisdictions in respect of sexual abuse policies. I refer in this regard to three more letters found online. The three were issued by JWCan and the JW Organizations in Britain and Australia. They are dated October 1, 2012 the same date as the above noted CCJW letter. The three other letters are virtually identical to the said CCJW letter. The copies of the October 1, 2012 JWCan and the British and Australian letters are attached hereto and respectively marked <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;M&rdquo;, &ldquo;N&rdquo;, and &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>34. Given that JWCan bears a strikingly similar name to those of JWPA and JWNY, it struck us that a corporation with a name similar to that of CCJW may also have been incorporated in Canada. Our searches disclosed no such entity. Attached to may affidavit and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of a Federal corporate name search. There is no corporation with a name similar to CCJW. We also conducted a corporate name search in Ontario, a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>35. On learning that the existing defendants may have little or nothing to do with the JW Organization's sex abuse policies and procedures since the early 2000's and about the time CCJW was incorporated, we reviewed our data bank of individuals who have contacted us about this case and identified possible representative plaintiffs to act in respect of those claims and, in particular, as regards the potential liability of CCJW. The said process identified as Melissa White. Based on information provided to us by Her, we have prepared the draft Amended Statement of Claim which sets out her allegations, including those relating to CCJW. Melissa White has indicated to us her interest in and desire to be added as a representative plaintiff in this action.</P1>
<P1>36. Our firm has now been retained by the two proposed representative plaintiffs to pursue claims on behalf of class members on whose behalf they might act.</P1>
<P1>37. Our firm has also had contact with another alleged sex abuse victim, by the name of Sandra Hall. All her circumstances relate to Ontario, where she presently resides The draft Amended Statement of Claim also contains allegations relating to her experiences.</P1>
<P1>38. I note that a plurality of the many dozens of alleged Jehovah's Witness sex abuse victims who have contacted our firm state that they did or now reside in Ontario and/or were sexually abused in Ontario.</P1>
<P1>39. The plaintiff, Christian Gutierrez, consents to the Melissa White and Sandra Hall being added as plaintiffs and proposed representative plaintiffs in this action.</P1>
<P1>40. Melissa White and Sandra Hall consent to being added as plaintiffs and proposed representative plaintiffs.</P1>
<P1>41. Based on the foregoing, I believe CCJW is a proper and necessary defendant to this proceeding Mid that Sandra Hall and Melissa White are proper and necessary plaintiffs.</P1>
<P1>42. Also based on the foregoing, we propose that the Statement of Claim be amended in accordance with the draft Amended Statement of Claim attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> and that the title of proceedings be amended to accord with that identified in the Notice of Motion.</P1></P>
<P>I swear this affidavit to give my evidence herein and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiff has delivered three improper affidavits from his counsel's law partner (Mr. Peter Tuovi) that are almost entirely on &ldquo;information and belief&rdquo; from his counsel (Mr. Bryan McPhadden). These affidavits ought to be struck for non-compliance with the established rules for solicitor's affidavits and, if they are not struck, Mr. McPhadden should be precluded from arguing the pending motions. That is the common law rule enforced by this Court, and it is among the <EM>Rules of Professional Conduct</EM>.</P>
<P>2. Lawyers cannot avoid this rule &ldquo;through the subterfuge of having someone else swear the affidavit based on information and belief&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Trempe v. Reybroek</SOC><CITE>[2002] O.J. No. 369</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [Book of Authorities (&ldquo;BOA&rdquo;), Tab 12].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as Mr. McPhadden has attempted through Mr. Tuovi. It is well-established that lawyers who supply the evidence of the named affiant are also precluded from appearing as counsel. That is the case here, as each of the three affidavits state that, &ldquo;[e]xcept where otherwise specifically indicated below, I am advised of the following by Mr. McPhadden and verily believe same to be true.&rdquo; Mr. Tuovi then recounts contentious allegations, arguments, and opinions without ever specifically claiming to have personal knowledge of any claimed facts.</P>
<P>3. Solicitors' affidavits should be struck out: (1) where they assert contentious evidence; (2) where they contain speculation, argument, conclusions, and opinions; and (3) where they attempt to shield the true affiant from cross-examination. The impugned affidavits are replete with each of these substantive defects. Objections to specific paragraphs are outlined in charts below. But the defects are so many, and so intertwined, that the three affidavits should be struck in their entirety.</P>
<P>4. If the affidavits are not struck in their entirety, the specific paragraphs outlined below in the charts should be struck. Alternatively, if any paragraphs survive that are on information and belief from Mr. McPhadden, he should be precluded from appearing as counsel on the pending motions.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Context for this Motion to Strike Affidavits</TI>
<P>5. This motion to strike is brought by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (&ldquo;U.S. Defendants&rdquo;) as a preliminary matter in advance of two motions returnable August 2, 2019 (the &ldquo;August Motions&rdquo;). The August Motions are: (1) the plaintiff's motion seeking to amend the statement of claim and add parties (the &ldquo;Plaintiff's Motion&rdquo;); and (2) the cross-motion of the U.S. Defendants for an Order setting aside service <EM>ex juris</EM> and declaring that the Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the action against them or the defendant that the Plaintiff's Motion seeks to add (the &ldquo;Jurisdiction Motion&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. The U.S. Defendant's Jurisdiction Motion is based on jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> and does not raise <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> as a ground to decline the exercise of jurisdiction. Accordingly, facts regarding the comparative convenience of for a are irrelevant (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the locations of witnesses or the comparative preferability of procedures). The only relevant facts are those that speak to whether there is a real and substantial connection between Ontario and either the U.S. Defendants or the proposed new U.S. defendant (Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (&ldquo;CCJW&rdquo;)).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Shah v. LG Chem; Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 2628</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 10].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. At a case management conference on January 11, 2019, the plaintiff's counsel forecasted certain preliminary motions. The Court also scheduled the present motion to strike affidavits to be heard with the other preliminary issues.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Direction of The Honourable Justice Perell dated January 11, 2019: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 5, pp. 532-533.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. In view of their impropriety, counsel for the U.S. Defendants did not cross-examine Mr. Tuovi on his three affidavits, and instead wrote to counsel for the plaintiff to confirm that they would move to strike out the improper affidavits at the scheduled May 2 motion date.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>The Tuovi Affidavits Are the Evidence of Mr. McPhadden, Counsel on the August Motions</TI>
<P>9. The plaintiff has delivered three affidavits of Peter Tuovi, a partner in the law firm acting for the plaintiff in these proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First Tuovi Affidavit, para. 1: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 2, p. 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Those affidavits are dated August 3, 2018 (the &ldquo;first Tuovi Affidavit&rdquo;), January 2, 2019 (the &ldquo;Second Tuovi Affidavit&rdquo;), and April 2, 2019 (the &ldquo;Third Tuovi Affidavit&rdquo;). Collectively, Mr. Tuovi's three affidavits are referred to as the &ldquo;Tuovi Affidavits.&rdquo;</P>
<P>10. The Third Tuovi Affidavit was delivered after plaintiff's counsel had already conducted its cross-examinations of the U.S. Defendants, and as such requires leave of this Court pursuant to Rule 39.02(2) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. As set out below, leave should be refused because the Third Tuovi Affidavit is also inadmissible and improper.</P>
<P>11. The contents of the Tuovi Affidavits expressly constitute the evidence of Mr. Tuovi's law partner, Mr. Bryan McPhadden, who has carriage of this action on behalf of the plaintiff.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First Tuovi Affidavit, para. 1: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 2, p. 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Each of the Touvi Affidavits states that &ldquo;[e]xcept where otherwise specifically indicated below, I am advised of the following by Mr. McPhadden and verily believe same to be true.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First Tuovi Affidavit, para. 1: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 2, p. 7; Second Tuovi Affidavit, para. 1: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 3, p. 148; Third Tuovi Affidavit, paras. 1, 3: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 4, pp. 450-451.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There are no paragraphs of the Tuovi Affidavits where Mr. Tuovi specifically claims to have personal knowledge of <BOLD><EM>any</EM></BOLD> facts. There are, however, a very small number of paragraphs where the source of Mr. Tuovi's information and belief is given as being the existing plaintiff in these proceedings, or as the proposed new plaintiffs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Tuovi Affidavit, paras. 7, 8, 10, and 15: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 3, pp. 150&ndash;152.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF LAW</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Jurisdiction and Test to Strike Out Affidavits</TI>
<P>12. This Court has the jurisdiction pursuant to Rules 4.06(2), 25.11, and 39.01(4) to strike out the Tuovi Affidavits on the basis that they contain improper, inadmissible, and irrelevant evidence, and are thus abusive, frivolous, vexatious, and will necessarily delay the August Motions. Exercising this jurisdiction prevents prejudice to the adverse party and wasted effort and expense.</P>
<P>13. Rule 4.06(2) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> states that &ldquo;[a]n affidavit shall be confined to the statement of facts within the personal knowledge of the deponent or to other evidence that the deponent could give if testifying as a witness in court, except where these rules provide otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
<P>14. Rule 39.01(4) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> provides an exception to Rule 4.06(2) for motions: &ldquo;An affidavit for use on a motion may contain statements of the deponent's information and belief, if the source of the information and the fact of the belief are specified in the affidavit&rdquo;.</P>
<P>15. A court may strike out all or part of a document such as an affidavit pursuant to Rule 25.11 if the document (or parts thereof): (a) may prejudice or delay a fair trial; (b) is scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious; or (c) is an abuse of the process of the court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ismail v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 6780</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 6].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Court recently articulated the principles governing the exercise of this power as applied to affidavit evidence filed on a motion:
<ITEM><P>&ldquo;Improper hearsay, argument and irrelevant information should not be contained in an affidavit. [... ] [L]egal argument belongs in a factum or brief, and not an affidavit. Legal submissions contained in an affidavit are also superfluous, and should be struck out.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ismail v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 6780</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 6].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>&ldquo;Subject to specific exceptions, [... ] opinion evidence generally is impermissible and excluded. Witnesses generally are to testify as to the facts which they perceived, not as to the inferences/opinions they drew from them. It is for the trier and not the witness to form opinions, and draw inferences and conclusions. [... ] [E]ven properly qualified experts are to provide only opinion evidence that is fair, objective and nonpartisan.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ismail v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 6780</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 6], citing <EM>inter alia</EM>, <CASEREF><SOC>White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.</SOC><CITE>[2015] 2 S.C.R. 182</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Tab 13].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>&ldquo;Violations of the rules of evidence relating to affidavits are not mere technicalities or irregularities that may be cured or waived. To the contrary, where it is clear in law that affidavit evidence is inadmissible, leaving it on the record is embarrassing and prejudicial to the fair hearing of a motion or application.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ismail v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 6780</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 6].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>&ldquo;Evidence tendered in violation of the rules of evidence and <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> therefore must be regarded as worthless, and should not be considered; e.g., by the court refusing to receive the affidavit, striking the relevant paragraphs from the offending affidavit, and/or by the court otherwise paying no regard to the evidence.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ismail v. Fleming</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 6780</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 6].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM></P>
<P>16. Courts have held that an affidavit should be excluded entirely if it is not possible to separate admissible from inadmissible portions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sharma v. Canadian Pacific Railway</SOC><CITE>2016 FC 135</CITE><PARANUM>19, 23</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 11].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Striking out the entire affidavit is appropriate where, as here, the impugned affidavits are riddled with inadmissible, improper, irrelevant and prejudicial statements which, when taken as a whole, render the affidavit itself as an abuse of process.</P>
<P>17. This is an appropriate case to strike out the Tuovi Affidavits on a preliminary motion because they are &ldquo;clearly improper and it would inevitably give rise to extraordinary cost or difficulty for the other party.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Allianz Global v. Attorney General of Canada</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 29</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 1].;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The extraordinary cost arises because the outcome of this motion will impact the ability of Mr. McPhadden to appear as counsel. If the Court decides not to strike the Tuovi Affidavits, the result will be that Mr. McPhadden cannot appear as counsel on the August Motions because doing so would constitute appearing on his own evidence. If this arose only in August, the August Motions would need to be adjourned, causing significant thrown-away costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Improper Evidence from Counsel on the Motion</TI>
<P>18. This Court has established rules for the proper use of lawyers' affidavits, and the Tuovi Affidavits ignore those rules and should be struck. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 4].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> this Court found a lawyer's affidavit both inadmissible and inappropriate, based on the following principles:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;If it is necessary to rely on the information or belief of counsel with carriage of the file, it is preferable for counsel to swear the affidavit and have other counsel argue the motion. This approach will not be appropriate for highly contentious issues that may form part of the evidence at trial. If the evidence of counsel becomes necessary for trial on a contentious issue, it may be necessary for the client to retain another law firm.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>14(b)</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 4]. See also <CASEREF><SOC>Pavao v. Ferreira</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1573</CITE><PARANUM>39</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 8].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;Unless the evidence of a lawyer is being tendered as expert testimony on the motion, it is not appropriate for an affidavit to contain legal opinions or argument. Those should be reserved for the factum.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>14(c)</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA. Tab 4].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>19. The Court noted that a lawyer who provides an affidavit on matters that are not purely formal or uncontroverted risks contravening Rule 5.2 of the <EM>Rules of Professional Conduct</EM> (dealing with the professional limits of lawyers also acting as witnesses).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 4.].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court also warned lawyers not to give evidence on the merits of a matter (as Mr. Tuovi has done here),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <EM>e.g.</EM>, Second Tuovi Affidavit, paras. 7, 10: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 3, pp. 150-151.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as this risks the lawyer putting his credibility on the line and &ldquo;threaten[s]&rdquo; the &ldquo;integrity of the judicial system&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 41].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. This is particularly problematic where the lawyer gives opinions regarding the appropriate outcome of the proceeding, as this is &ldquo;implicitly criticizing the court should it come to a different view.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA. Tab 4].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Messrs. Tuovi and McPhadden do this, for example, where they opine that CCJW is a &ldquo;proper and necessary defendant to this proceeding&rdquo; and that certain new people are &ldquo;proper and necessary plaintiffs.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First Tuovi Affidavit, para. 41: <EM>Motion Record</EM>, Tab 2, p. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This sworn opinion undermines the role of this Court and their status of counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ferreira v. Cardenas</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 7119</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 4].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Where these rules are not followed, the offending paragraphs of an affidavit may be struck if they amount to &ldquo;substantive defects&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;merely formal defects&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Zanewycz v. Manryk</SOC><CITE>[2009] O.J. No. 3528</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [BOA, Tab 14].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Zanewycz v. Manryk</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court applied these principles and struck parts of a party's affidavit that were on &ldquo;information and belief&rdquo; from the counsel who appeared on the motion, and which went &ldquo;beyond merely summarizing evidence that was otherwise admissible from other sources.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Zanewycz v.

<P>22. Unless the Tuovi Affidavits are struck, Mr. McPhadden is precluded from arguing or appearing as counsel at the August Motions.

<P>24. The Tuovi Affidavits are not &ldquo;purely formal or uncontroverted&rdquo;, as they are replete with speculation, argument, conclusions, and opinions (as set out further below), which are improper and highly contentious. The U.S. Defendants and CCJW have given evidence setting out the factual basis for challenging the assertions of Messrs. Tuovi and McPhadden. Should either counsel appear on the August Motions, they will be in the embarrassing position of defending their own sworn statements against the sworn statements of persons who have personal knowledge.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>26.
