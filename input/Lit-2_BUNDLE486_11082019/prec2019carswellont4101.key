<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>THE PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT APPEALS to the Court of Appeal from the costs decision of the Honourable Justice Markus Koehnen (the &ldquo;Application Judge&rdquo;) dated March 3, 2018 made at Toronto.</P>
<P>THE APPELLANT ASKS that the costs award granted by the Application Judge be set aside with costs.</P>
<P>THE GROUNDS FOR THE APPEAL are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Respondents were awarded costs of $60,583.05 arising from a failed application to assess the fees of the Respondents;</P>
<P>2. The Application Judge erred in law in holding that the costs awarded a self-represented litigant should be &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, contrary to the binding decision of the Divisional Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF>;</P>
<P>3. The Application Judge further erred in law in permitting evidence of opportunity costs to be introduced by way of Reply, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Lansdowne v. Ottawa</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 1015</CITE><PARANUM>56</PARANUM></CASEREF>;</P>
<P>4. The Application Judge further erred in law in awarding a self-represented litigant partial indemnity costs at exactly the same rate as would be awarded against a losing party who was not self-represented, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC><CITE>[1999] O.J. No. 4600</CITE><COURTJUR>C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>;</P>
<P>5. The Application Judge further erred in awarding the Respondent opportunity costs without requiring him to demonstrate that the work performed could not have been done on weekends or evenings, contrary to the principle articulated in <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE></CASEREF>, where the court held that evidence of lost personal time does not amount to an opportunity cost;</P>
<P>6. The Application Judge's findings conflict with binding appellate jurisprudence;</P>
<P>7. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. Rule 62.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>2. Leave to appeal was granted on June 29, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Appellate jurisprudence<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC><YEAR>1999</YEAR><CITE>)46 O.R. (3d) 330</CITE></CASEREF>, Plaintiff's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;BOA&rdquo;), Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> has confirmed a) that self-represented litigants are not to be awarded costs at all unless the self-represented litigant proves opportunity cost (the Opportunity Costs Rule or &ldquo;OCR&rdquo;);<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and b) that if the self-represented litigant does prove opportunity costs and is allowed costs, the costs awarded are to be nominal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Self-represented litigants should not be awarded normal partial indemnity costs.</P>
<P>2. This appeal raises two issues: a) for the purpose of the OCR, what is the nature of the evidence that the self-represented litigant must show in order to prove opportunity cost; and b) whether a self-represented litigant who is also a lawyer should be able to recover costs in the same amount as a successful litigant would have been awarded if they had been represented by a lawyer charging ordinary fees.</P>
<P>3. As will be explained below, it is the appellants' position that a) in order to prove opportunity costs for the purposes of the OCR, self-represented litigants must prove that they incurred an opportunity cost that could not have been avoided had the litigation work been done after normal business hours, and b) self-represented litigants who are lawyers should not be in a privileged position when it comes to costs awards.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>4. In September 2015, the appellants/clients (&ldquo;Clients&rdquo;) issued an application in Superior court to assess the fees of the respondents/lawyers (&ldquo;Lawyers&rdquo;), who had billed the Clients fees of over $500,000 in defending their interests in <CASEREF><SOC>DSLC Capital Corporation v. Credifinance Securities Limited, Donabo Inc., Georges Benarroch, Marjorie Ann Glover, and Credifinance Capital Corp.</SOC></CASEREF> with Court File No. 09-CL-8003.</P>
<P>5. On February 7, 2018, the application was heard and dismissed by the Honourable Justice Markus Koehnen (the &ldquo;Costs Judge&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. At the conclusion of the hearing on February 7, after the Court read its reasons dismissing the application, the Lawyers made oral submissions on costs and submitted a costs outline supporting a request for costs in the amount of $60,583.05, which was based on the time the Lawyers spent defending the application calculated at 60% of their standard hourly rate, i.e., the rate that the Lawyers charge the public for their legal services.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Costs Outline of Respondents Fred Tayar &amp; Associates P.C. et al, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants (&ldquo;ABC&rdquo;), Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. The Lawyers were self-represented at the application, and thus did not actually incur these costs.</P>
<P>8. In the Lawyers' costs submissions made orally before the Costs Judge, the Lawyers did not argue that they had incurred opportunity costs in the context of defending the application.</P>
<P>9. The Clients sought and received permission from the Costs Judge to respond in writing to the Lawyers' oral submissions.</P>
<P>10. On February 14, 2018, the Clients provided their responding submissions on the subject of costs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Responding Costs Submissions of Applicants Georges Benarroch et al, ABC, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In these submissions, the Clients argued that the Lawyers should receive no costs, as they had not alleged that they had incurred opportunity cost, nor provided evidence as to opportunity cost incurred. The Clients argued in the alternative that the Lawyers should receive costs in an amount not greater than $5,860, including HST, as nominal costs, following the Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Mustang</EM>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. In their submissions, the Clients set out the binding jurisprudence on the subject of costs awards to self-represented litigants, which states clearly that the courts may not award costs to the self-represented litigant, even a self-represented lawyer, absent evidence of opportunity cost to the litigant: <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>12. In a reply dated February 26, 2018,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter to Justice Markus Koehnen from Respondent Fred Tayar &amp; Associates P .C., ABC, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Lawyers acknowledged that <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC></CASEREF> was the binding authority, and alleged for the first time that they had suffered opportunity costs in responding to the application. In support of their submission, the Lawyers provided affidavits with bald assertions on their opportunity costs. They provided no evidence as to the number or nature of the files they claim to have turned away, their estimate as to the income they gave up in doing so, or the fact that they could not have found the time to do them in addition to their self-represented work on this matter. The affidavits contained only vague statements that they performed the work during normal business hours and had to refer files to other lawyers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavits of Fred Tayar and Colby Linthwaite sworn February 26, 2018, ABC, Tabs 9 and 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. In a sur-reply dated March 1, 2018, the Clients identified and explained the following legal errors in the Lawyers' approach: a) costs awarded a self-represented litigant should be nominal, whether the litigant is a lawyer or not; b) to be awarded costs at all, a self-represented litigant must demonstrate opportunity cost; and c) new evidence must not be served by way of reply.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Further Responding Costs submissions of Applicants Georges Benarroch et al, ABC, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. On March 3, 2018, the Costs Judge provided his endorsement in favour of the Lawyers,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement of Justice Koehnen dated March 3, 2018, ABC, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> awarding them the full amount of costs they requested, calculated at 60% of the fees the Lawyers would charge the public, i.e. full partial indemnity costs.</P>
<P>15. The Clients sought leave to appeal the decision of the Costs Judge. On June 29, 2018 the Clients were granted leave to appeal the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement granting Leave to Appeal the Costs Decision, ABC, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK1>

<P1>(a) Are self-represented litigants entitled to costs if they choose to forego remunerative activity and work on the litigation during normal business hours, but could have performed both the work on the litigation and the remunerative activity, if they had worked on the litigation outside of normal business hours? Said another way, for the purposes of demonstrating opportunity cost as required by Fong, can the self-represented litigant claim for opportunity cost that could have been avoided if the self-represented litigant worked on the litigation at home or on vacation?</P1>
<P1>(b) Should a self-represented litigant, who also happens to be a lawyer, be able to recover costs in exactly the same amount as a successful litigant who is being represented by a lawyer charging legal fees?</P1>
<P1>(c) When is it permissible to serve new evidence by way of reply?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Standard Of Review</TI>
<P>17. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the standard of review on pure questions of law is one of correctness, and that &ldquo;an appellate court is thus free to replace the opinion of a trial judge with its own.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>[2002] 2 SCR 235</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. It is the Clients' position that the Costs Judge erred on the following issues of law in awarding the Lawyers partial indemnity costs for successfully defeating the application:
<P1>(a) The Costs Judge erred in awarding the Respondents opportunity costs without requiring them to demonstrate that the work performed could not have been done on weekends or evenings, contrary to the principle articulated in <CASEREF><SOC>Logtenberg v. ING Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2008 CarswellOnt 2390, BOA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<EM>Logtenberg</EM>&rdquo;), where the court held that evidence of lost personal time does not amount to an opportunity cost.</P1>
<P1>(b) The Costs Judge erred in holding that the costs awarded a self-represented litigant should be &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, and specifically in awarding a self-represented litigant partial indemnity costs at exactly the same rate as would be awarded against a losing party who was not self-represented, contrary to the binding decision of the Divisional Court in <EM>Mustang</EM>, and to other jurisprudence which has awarded only very modest costs to self-represented litigants;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Costs Judge erred in permitting evidence of opportunity costs to be introduced by way of Reply, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Lansdowne v. Ottawa</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2011 ONSC 1015, BOA, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<EM>Lansdowne</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 56;</P1></P>
<P>19. The Clients seek an order reversing the Cost Judge's decision, awarding zero costs or in the alternative nominal costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Costs For Self-Represented Litigants</TI>
<P>20. In <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[1999] O.J. No. 4600 (C.A.), BOA, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Sharpe J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, noted that &ldquo;the preponderance of modem authority supports the contention that both self-represented lawyers and self-represented lay litigants may be awarded costs and that such costs may include allowances for counsel fees&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21. However, Justice Sharpe held that:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>[S]elf-represented litigants, be they legally trained or not, are not entitled to costs calculated on the same basis as those of the litigant who retains counsel. As the Chorley case, supra, recognized, all litigants suffer a loss of time through their involvement in the legal process. <BOLD>The self-represented litigant should not recover costs for the time and effort that any litigant would have to devote to the case. Costs should only be awarded to those lay litigants who can demonstrate that they devoted time and effort to do the work ordinarily done by a lawyer retained to conduct the litigation, <UNDER>and that as a result</UNDER>, they incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity</BOLD>. As the early Chancery rule recognized, a self-represented lay litigant should receive only a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; allowance for the loss of time devoted to preparing and presenting the case. This excludes routine awards on a per diem basis to litigants who would ordinarily be in attendance at court in any event [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>22. In <EM>Mustang</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2010 ONSC 3444, BOA, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Divisional Court made clear that the rule in <EM>Fong</EM>, cited above, that an SRL cannot recover any costs absent evidence of opportunity cost, is binding jurisprudence which cannot be deviated from, and no injustice arises from following that rule.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. In <EM>Mustang</EM>, the lower court motions judge was satisfied that the defendant had done work that would ordinarily have been done by a lawyer and he determined that in the particular circumstances of the case this was sufficient to justify an award of costs notwithstanding the absence of proof that an opportunity cost had been incurred.</P>
<P>24. Speaking for the Divisional Court, Jennings. J. stated: <FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>In my opinion, the language used by Sharpe J.A. [in <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC></CASEREF>] is clear. First, to receive costs a lay litigant must demonstrate that he or she devoted time and effort to do the work ordinarily done by a lawyer and that as a result he or she incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity. Second, if an opportunity cost is proved a self-represented litigant should only receive a moderate or reasonable allowance for the loss of time devoted to preparing and presenting the case.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. In sum, Jennings J. clearly set out the rule regarding the entitlement of SRLs to costs as follows: &ldquo;<EM>Simply stated, no proof of opportunity cost, no nominal costs available</EM>&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>20 <EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added].</P>
<P>26. In the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Sydney Charendoff et al. v. Alec Mclennan and 124155 Canada Inc. et al</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2012 ONSC 7241, BOA, Tab 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<EM>Sydney Charendoff</EM>&rdquo;), MacDonnell J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice made it clear that the Divisional Court's holding in <EM>Mustang</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario's holding in <EM>Fong</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, extend to self-represented lawyers as well.</P>
<P>27. The Court stated: <FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>The cases I have referred to make it clear that it will not be assumed that an opportunity cost has been incurred. I do not read Fong as taking a different position where the self-represented litigant happens to be a lawyer.</P>
<P>What Fong did is extend the lost opportunity principle, which had been used to justify awarding costs to self-represented lawyers, to all self-represented litigants. <BOLD>In other words, Fong put all self-represented litigants into the same boat in relation to the criteria for an award of costs. It is no more obvious that lawyers who choose to act for themselves will have to forego other remunerative activity than it is for individuals with other employment. Accordingly, if self-represented lawyers wish to obtain costs orders, they must establish that they did in fact suffer the loss of an earnings opportunity</BOLD>. Even if the loss of an earnings opportunity can be assumed in some cases, I would not make such an assumption here. <BOLD>There is no basis upon which it could reasonably be inferred that Mr. McLennan had to decline other remunerative activity in order to work on his own case</BOLD>. .... The rule articulated by Justice Jennings on behalf of the Divisional Court is binding and there is no reason not to apply it in this case [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Similarly, in <EM>Tiago</EM>, Stinson J. stated:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2012 ONSC 5090 at para. 6, BOA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>[I]n Ontario, a judge may exercise his or her discretion to award costs to a self-represented litigant only if (1) the litigant devoted time and effort to do the work ordinarily done by a lawyer; and (2) that as a result she or he incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity...</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>To meet the second part of the test, a self-represented litigant must prove that he or she gave up remunerative activity</BOLD>... [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. Stinson J. ultimately held that he was unable to award costs due to the plaintiffs' failure to provide evidence or proof supporting their claim for lost opportunity costs: <FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>In light of the plaintiffs' failure to provide evidence or proof supporting their claim for lost opportunity costs, I am unable to award the nominal costs otherwise provided for under the legal authority binding on me in Ontario</BOLD>. I therefore award no costs to the plaintiffs in respect of their personal time devoted to the litigation [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>What Are Opportunity Costs?</TI>
<P>30. In <EM>Logtenberg</EM>, Gauthier J. noted at para. 35 that &ldquo;there is no authority to award costs or time taken away from family or for reduced quality of life, as claimed by the plaintiff&rdquo;. Self-represented litigants have always given up their time and contributed their efforts to their own cause. These sacrifices may well infringe on the litigant's quality of life, whether the litigant in question is a neurosurgeon, an investment banker, or an unemployed person. Gauthier J. states clearly that this does not give rise to an award of costs.</P>
<P>31. In contrast, the Costs Judge in the present case took a diametrically opposed position when it came to finding opportunity costs in the case of lawyers representing themselves without proof or allegation that the opportunity costs complained of could not have been accomplished had the Lawyers taken away from home or vacation time to work on the application. He indicated, at para. 10 of his endorsement, that &ldquo;forcing the lawyer to demonstrate that he or she could not have worked on weekends or into the evenings is the beginning of a never ending forensic inquiry&rdquo;. He then went on to say that &ldquo;the next step would no doubt be to ask why the lawyer could not have worked later into the evening or longer on weekends or worked on vacations in order to address the applicants' proceeding&rdquo;.</P>
<P>32. The Cost Judge's approach essentially allows the Lawyers to claim for missing home or family time contrary to <EM>Logtenberg</EM>. In so doing, the Costs Judge fell into legal error, which this appeal seeks to correct.</P>
<P>33. However, even if the Court were to accept that the Lawyers did incur opportunity costs, which is denied, the Cost Judge's award of $60,583.05 amounts to normal partial indemnity costs and is excessive, and incorrect at law.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Costs Awarded A Self-Represented Litigant Should Be Nominal</TI>
<P>34. In <EM>Mustang</EM>, at para. 23, Jennings J. held for a unanimous Divisional Court panel that to receive costs, a self-represented litigant must provide evidence that he or she incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity. At para. 27 she succinctly summarized the standard at which costs should be assessed: &ldquo;Simply stated, no proof of opportunity costs, no <EM>nominal</EM> costs available&rdquo; (emphasis added).</P>
<P>35. In contrast, the Costs Judge in the present case held at para. 12 that the Lawyers' rates of $300 per hour and higher was &ldquo;<EM>moderate and reasonable</EM>,&rdquo; when the standard clearly articulated in <EM>Mustang</EM> is that of <EM>nominal</EM> costs.</P>
<P>36. In <CASEREF><SOC>H. (D.) v. Hydro One Networks Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[2002] O.J. No. 4547, BOA, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> at para 33, Master Dash held that he was prepared to award the self-represented litigant costs at the rate of $60 per hour, which is the maximum rate under the costs grid payable to a student-at-law on a partial indemnity scale. In <CASEREF><SOC>White v. Ritchie</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[2009] O.J. No. 2360, BOA, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> at para 24, Newbould J. awarded a self-represented party an allowance of $15,000 in total for the work done, and in <CASEREF><SOC>Henderson v. Pearlman</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2010 ONSC 149 at para. 4, BOA, Tab 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hennessy J. awarded the self-represented litigant 120 hours of time spent at $20 per hour.</P>
<P>37. This level of modest costs award has been determined to be appropriate for self-represented parties who have not incurred actual legal fees in pursuing or defending their case. Thus, in <EM>Sydney Charendoff</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2012 ONSC 7241, BOA, Tab 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> at para 18, McDonnell J. determined that &ldquo;the claim for compensation at an hourly rate of $375 is unjustifiable.&rdquo; The overarching principal with respect to costs is that of indemnity: see Rule 57.01(1)(0.a). It is clear that unless costs are actually incurred out of pocket or some other extraordinary situation prevails, the rule with respect to litigants representing themselves is that nominal to modest costs are all that the courts should award.</P>
<P>38. In light of the above cases, the decision to award costs in the amount of $60,583.05 to a self-represented litigant, at hourly rates ranging from $300 to $350 per hour, amounts to an error of law.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>New Evidence Must Not Be Served By Way Of Reply</TI>
<P>39. The Costs Judge further fell into error when he admitted the Lawyers' affidavits by way of reply.</P>
<P>40. In <CASEREF><SOC>Lockridge v. Director, Ministry of the Environment</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2013 ONSC 6935. BOA, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<EM>Lockridge</EM>&rdquo;), this court set out five factors to determine whether new evidence should be permitted by way of reply:
<QUOTE><P>The court will consider the potential prejudice and unfair surprise to the respondents; whether the evidence is responsive to the respondents' case or is merely confirmatory; whether the evidence will assist the court in making its determination on the merits; whether the evidence was available and/or could not have been anticipated as being relevant at the time the application was filed; and the applicants' reasons for their delay in adducing the evidence&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>41. Under this framework, the Lawyers should not have been permitted to serve new evidence by way of reply. There was significant prejudice and unfair surprise in permitting them to do so after the Clients had already advised in their submissions as to what the relevant law was; the evidence is vague and self-serving and thus cannot be of any assistance to the Court; that such evidence would be relevant could certainly have been anticipated at the outset of costs submissions; and there is no good reason for the Lawyers having delayed in adducing the evidence.</P>
<P>42. In addition to the above, providing affidavit evidence by way of reply enabled the Lawyers to come up with a statement vague enough not to be examined carefully, but that nonetheless managed to address the exact issues raised by the Clients in their submissions. This is precisely what the jurisprudence on serving new evidence by way of reply is designed to prevent.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>43. The Clients respectfully submit their appeal of the order of the Costs Judge be allowed and the order of the Costs Judge substituted with an award of no costs, or in the alternative, the sum of $5,000 representing nominal costs.</P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL COSTS DECISION (Costs Decision of Justice Markus Koehnen dated March 3, 2018)</TI>
<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT the Plaintiff, Georges Benarroch (the &ldquo;Moving Party&rdquo;) will make a motion to the Court on a date to be fixed by the Registrar, at the Courthouse at 180 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>METHOD OF HEARING</BOLD>: The motion is to be heard in writing.</P>
<P>THE RELIEF SOUGHT:</P>
<P>1. An Order granting leave to the Moving Parties to appeal the costs award granted by the application judge.</P>
<P>2. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. The Respondents were awarded costs of $60,583.05 arising from a failed application to assess the fees of the Respondents.</P>
<P>2. The Application Judge erred in law in holding that the costs awarded a self-represented litigant should be &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, contrary to the binding decision of the Divisional Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF>;</P>
<P>3. The Application Judge further erred in law in permitting evidence of opportunity costs to be introduced by way of Reply, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Lansdowne v. Ottawa</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 1015</CITE><PARANUM>56</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>4. The Application Judge further erred in law in awarding a self-represented litigant partial indemnity costs at exactly the same rate as would be awarded against a losing party who was not self-represented, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC><CITE>[1999] O.J. No. 4600</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>5. The Application Judge further erred in awarding the Respondent opportunity costs without requiring him to demonstrate that the work performed could not have been done on weekends or evenings, contrary to the principle articulated in <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE></CASEREF>, where the court held that evidence of lost personal time does not amount to an opportunity cost.</P>
<P>6. The Application Judge's findings conflict with binding appellate jurisprudence and it is desirable that leave to appeal be granted because the issue of the scale of recovery for costs for self-represented litigants is important and transcends the issues of the parties and relates to issues of the practice of law generally.</P>
<P>7. There is good reason to doubt the correctness of the Order in respect of costs, and the issues raised are of such importance to that leave should be granted. The issues sought to be appealed transcend the issues of the parties and relates to issues of the practice of law generally.</P>
<P>8. S. 133(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, Rule 62.02(4)(a),(b) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>;</P>
<P>9. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be relied on at the hearing of the motion:</P>
<P>1. Endorsement of Justice Koehnen dated March 3, 2018.</P>
<P>2. The Affidavit Evidence of the Respondents dated February 26, 2018;</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>1. The Applicants seek leave to appeal the costs order of the Honourable Justice Markus Koehnen (the &ldquo;Costs Judge&rdquo;) dated March 3, 2018, allowing the Respondents' costs in the amount of $60,583.05 including HST and disbursements. The Applicants had brought an application to assess the Respondents' fees. The costs in issue were awarded to the Respondents for successfully resisting the Applicants' assessment application.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. Appellate jurisprudence has confirmed that self-represented litigants are not to be awarded costs in amounts nearing what would be awarded had they retained counsel. The costs are to be nominal.</P>
<P>3. The question raised in this motion for leave to appeal is whether a self-represented litigant, who also happens to be a lawyer, should be able to recover costs in the <UNDER>same amount</UNDER> as a successful litigant would have been awarded if they had been represented by a lawyer charging ordinary fees. It is the Applicants' position that appellate jurisprudence confirms that lawyers as personal litigants should be placed in no better position than other self-represented litigants.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>4. At the hearing of the application for assessment of the Respondents' fees, the Respondents provided a costs outline, calculated at 60% of their standard hourly rate, i.e., the rate that the Respondents charge the public for their legal services.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Costs Outline of Respondents Fred Tayar &amp; Associates P.C. et al, Motion Record of the Applicants (&ldquo;MRA&rdquo;), Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This roughly corresponds with the rate at which costs are awarded on the standard partial indemnity scale. The Respondents were self-represented at the application, and thus did not actually incur these costs. In the Respondents' costs submissions made orally before the Costs Judge, the Respondents did not argue that they had incurred opportunity costs, nor did they make any attempt to explain why they should receive an award of costs on an equal level to someone who had actually retained counsel.</P>
<P>5. On February 14, 2018, the Applicants provided their responding submissions on the subject of costs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Responding Costs Submissions of Applicants Georges Benarroch et al, MRA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In these submissions, the Applicants set out the binding jurisprudence on the subject of costs awards to self-represented litigants, which states clearly that the courts may not award costs to the self-represented litigant, even a self-represented lawyer, absent evidence of opportunity cost to the litigant: <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v. Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>6. In a reply dated February 26, 2018,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter to Justice Markus Koehnen from Respondent Fred Tayar &amp; Associates P.C., MRS, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Respondents provided affidavits containing vague statements wherein they claim that they performed the work for this matter during normal business hours and that they had to refer prospective clients to other lawyers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavits of Fred Tayar and Colby Linthwaite sworn February 26, 2018, MRA, Tabs 4 and 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They provided no evidence as to the number or nature of these files, their estimate as to the income they gave up in turning them away, or the fact that they could not have found the time to do them in addition to their self-represented work on this matter.</P>
<P>7. In a sur-reply dated March 1, 2018, the Applicants detailed the legal errors in the Respondents' approach.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Further Responding Costs submissions of Applicants Georges Benarroch et al, MRA, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. On March 3, 2018, the Costs Judge provided his endorsement in favour of the Respondents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement of Justice Koehnen dated March 3, 2018, MRA, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In awarding the self-represented Respondents the same level of costs he would have awarded them had they retained outside counsel, the Costs Judge ignored the governing points of principle articulated by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. The Costs Judge's ruling likewise directly contradicted existing Divisional Court and Superior Court authority.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>9. Did the Costs Judge err in awarding the Respondents partial indemnity costs? It is the Applicants' position that he erred on three counts, as follows:
<P1>(a) The Costs Judge erred in holding that the costs awarded a self-represented litigant should be &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, and specifically in awarding a self-represented litigant partial indemnity costs at exactly the same rate as would be awarded against a losing party who was not self-represented, contrary to the binding decision of the Divisional Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3444</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Mustang</EM>&rdquo;) and to other jurisprudence which has awarded only very modest costs to self-represented litigants;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Costs Judge erred in awarding the Respondents opportunity costs without requiring them to demonstrate that the work performed could not have been done on weekends or evenings, contrary to the principle articulated in <CASEREF><SOC>Logtenberg v. ING Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[2008] O.J. No. 2044</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Logtenberg</EM>&rdquo;), where the court held that evidence of lost personal time does not amount to an opportunity cost.</P1>
<P1>(c) The Costs Judge erred in permitting evidence of opportunity costs to be introduced by way of Reply, contrary to <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Lansdowne v. Ottawa</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 1015</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Lansdowne</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 56;</P1></P>
<P>10. These errors of law demonstrate that leave to appeal ought to be granted, as will be elaborated below.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Rule 62.02(4) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P>11. S. 62.02(4) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, provides the standard for granting leave to appeal, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Leave to appeal shall not be granted unless,</P>
<P>(a) There is a conflicting decision by another judge or court in Ontario or elsewhere on the matter involved in the proposed appeal and it is, in the opinion of the panel hearing the motion, desirable that leave to appeal be granted; or</P>
<P>(b) There appears to the panel hearing the motion good reason to doubt the correctness of the order in question and the proposed appeal involves matters of such importance that, in the panel's opinion, leave to appeal should be granted.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. While it is only necessary to meet the standards set out in either (a) or (b) above in order for the Court to grant leave to appeal, the present case meets both of them.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Rule 62.02(4)(a)</TI>
<P>13. In <EM>Mustang</EM>, at para. 23, Jennings J. held for a unanimous Divisional Court panel that to receive costs, a self-represented litigant must provide evidence that he or she incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity. At para. 27 she succinctly summarized the standard at which costs should be assessed: &ldquo;Simply stated, no proof of opportunity costs, no <EM>nominal</EM> costs available&rdquo; (emphasis added).</P>
<P>14. By contrast, the Cost Judge in the present case held at para. 12 that the Respondents' rates of $300 per hour and higher was &ldquo;moderate and reasonable,&rdquo; when the standard clearly articulated in <EM>Mustang</EM> is that of <EM>nominal</EM> costs.</P>
<P>15. In addition, in <EM>Logtenberg</EM>, Gauthier J. noted at para. 35 that &ldquo;there is no authority to award costs or time taken away from family or for reduced quality of life, as claimed by the plaintiff&rdquo;. Self-represented litigants have always given up their time and contributed their efforts to their own cause. These sacrifices may well infringe on the litigant's quality of life, whether the litigant in question is a neurosurgeon, an investment banker, or an unemployed person. Gauthier J. states clearly that this does not give rise to an award of costs.</P>
<P>16. By contrast, the Cost Judge in the present case took a diametrically opposed position when it came to lawyers representing themselves. He indicated, at para. 10 of his endorsement, that &ldquo;forcing the lawyer to demonstrate that he or she could not have worked on weekends or into the evenings is the beginning of a never ending forensic inquiry&rdquo;. He then went on to say that &ldquo;the next step would no doubt be to ask why the lawyer could not have worked later into the evening or longer on weekends or worked on vacations in order to address the applicants' proceeding&rdquo;.</P>
<P>17. This approach of valuing a lawyer's time without the need for any particular inquiry places lawyers in a preferred position over and above all other personal litigants. The Court of Appeal has specifically admonished that lawyers are not in a special position when it comes to seeking their own costs as litigants. As Sharpe J.A. put it in <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC><YEAR>1999</YEAR><CITE>46 O.R. (3d) 330</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF>, &ldquo;self-represented litigants, <EM>be they legally trained or not</EM>, are not entitled to costs calculated on the same basis as those of the litigant who retains counsel&rdquo; (emphasis added).</P>
<P>18. Accordingly, the Cost Judge's ruling is at odds with the statement of general principle by the Court of Appeal, and is directly contrary to the general rule as set out in <EM>Mustang</EM> and <EM>Logtenberg</EM>.</P>
<P>19. As a matter of legal coherence, it is desirable for leave to appeal to be granted where there are conflicting judgments of the lower courts. In <CASEREF><SOC>Mask v. Silvercorp Metals, Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4647</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Mask</EM>&rdquo;), the court expounded on this policy at para. 9, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>If leave to appeal is to be granted on the grounds of conflicting decisions, the court must be satisfied [...] that it is desirable that leave to appeal be granted having regard to such factors as what is at stake in the order being challenged, the likelihood of the appeal being successful, the sufficiency of the record for the purposes of deciding the issues on appeal, and the problems of expense and delay.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>20. At stake in this case is not only the scale of cost recovery for the self-represented litigant, but the permissibility of inflating that recovery by serving new evidence by way of reply. This combination of substantive and procedural issues encompasses matters that transcend the issues of the parties and relate to the practice of law generally.</P>
<P>21. As specified at para 56 of <EM>Landsdowne</EM>, &ldquo;reply evidence should be limited to proper reply. That is, it should respond to evidence raised by the other party and should not be evidence that ought to have been submitted in the first place.&rdquo; Providing affidavit evidence by way of reply enabled the Respondents to come up with a statement vague enough not to be examined carefully, but that nonetheless managed to address the exact issues raised by the Appellants in their submissions. This is precisely what the jurisprudence on serving new evidence by way of reply is designed to prevent.</P>
<P>22. It seems likely that the appeal will be successful in light of the fact that there are well reasoned decisions by the Superior Court, Divisional Court, and Court of Appeal that conflict with key points in the Cost Judge's endorsement. Moreover, it is likely that the appeal will succeed in light of the fact that the Cost Judge relied on new evidence provided by way of reply, which should not have been permitted.</P>
<P>23. The documentary record for the purposes of deciding the issues on appeal is complete, and consists only of the endorsement of the Costs Judge and the affidavit evidence of the Respondents on their reply cost submissions. Given that this is the final step in this proceeding and that the Respondents will most likely be representing themselves, there is no problem of either expense or delay.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Rule 62.02(4)(b)</TI>
<P>24. In <EM>Mask</EM>, at para. 11, the court observed that &ldquo;in order to show that there is good reason to doubt the correctness of the order, the moving party need not show that the order is wrong or probably wrong, but rather, that the soundness of the order is open to very serious debate&rdquo;.</P>
<P>25. In <CASEREF><SOC>H. (D.) v. Hydro One Networks Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2002] O.J. No. 4547</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Master Dash held that he was prepared to award the self-represented litigant costs at the rate of $60 per hour, which is the maximum rate under the costs grid payable to a student-at-law on a partial indemnity scale. In <CASEREF><SOC>White v. Ritchie</SOC><CITE>[2009] O.J. No. 2360</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Newbould J. awarded a self-represented party &ldquo;a reasonable allowance for the work done&rdquo; of $15,000 in total, and in <CASEREF><SOC>Henderson v. Pearlman</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 149</CITE></CASEREF>, Hennessy J. awarded the self-represented litigant 120 hours of time spent at $20 per hour.</P>
<P>26. This level of modest costs award has been determined to be appropriate for self-represented parties who have not incurred actual legal fees in pursuing or defending their case. Thus, in <CASEREF><SOC>Sydney Charendoff et al v. Alec McLennan and 124155 Ontario Inc. et al</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 7241</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Sydney Charendoff</EM>&rdquo;), McDonnell J. determined that &ldquo;the claim for compensation at an hourly rate of $375 is unjustifiable.&rdquo; The overarching principal with respect to costs is that of indemnity: see Rule 57.01(1)(j). It is clear that unless costs are actually incurred out of pocket or some other extraordinary situation prevails, the rule with respect to litigants representing themselves is that nominal to modest costs are all that the courts should award.</P>
<P>27. In light of the above cases, the decision to award costs in the amount of $60,583.05 to a self-represented litigant, at hourly rates ranging from $300 to $350 per hour, is indeed open to very serious debate.</P>
<P>28. In <EM>Mask</EM>, the court further noted that in order to show that a matter is of general importance, &ldquo;the moving party must show that the matter is of importance to the public or to the development of the law or to the administration of justice and that ... [it] transcends the importance of the matter to the particular parties&rdquo;.</P>
<P>29. The question of whether a self-represented litigant, who happens to also be a lawyer, should be in a privileged position when it comes to recovering costs raises a serious question of public policy. It also implicates an important access to justice issue insofar as it operates to the detriment of all non-lawyer self-represented litigants.</P>
<P>30. In <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band</SOC><CITE>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 371</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that access to justice is of great relevance to costs awards. As McLachlin C J. put it, at para. 28, quoting <CASEREF><SOC>Rogers v. Sudbury (Administrator of Ontario Works)</SOC><YEAR>2001</YEAR><CITE>57 O.R. (3d) 467</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, &ldquo;costs can be used as an instrument of policy&rdquo;. In this respect, the court should strive to fashion costs awards on as egalitarian a basis as possible.</P>
<P>31. The circumstances of &ldquo;ordinary citizens&rdquo; in using the courts are &ldquo;recognized as a legitimate and important policy objective&rdquo;: <EM>Okanagan Indian Band</EM>, supra, at para. 28. By contrast, access to justice is not served by privileging lawyer litigants as did the Costs Judge.</P>
<P>32. Accordingly, the question raised in this application is of great importance to the public. Leave to appeal should be granted so that the Court of Appeal can rationalize the conflicting case law and bring the ruling into line with the overarching principles that govern all costs awards.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>31. The Applicants respectfully submit that leave to appeal the order of the Costs Judge be granted.</P>

<P>3. The applicants brought an application for an order directing an assessment of accounts rendered by the respondent law firm, respecting work performed by the respondent lawyers. The application was dismissed by Justice Koehnen of the Superior Court of Justice (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Application Judge</BOLD>&rdquo;), in reasons dated February 7, 2018.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of the Honourable Justice Koehnen dated February 7, 2018, Tab 1 to the Responding Motion Record of the Respondents (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Respondents' Record</BOLD>&rdquo;) at Tab 2; Order of the Honourable Justice Koehnen dated February 7, 2018, Respondents' Record at Tab 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No appeal was taken from that decision.</P>
<P>4. At the conclusion of the hearing of the application, the Application Judge invited oral submissions on costs. The respondents sought costs of $60,583.05 on a partial indemnity basis, including disbursements and HST. The applicants were not prepared to argue costs, and asked for the opportunity to make written submissions, which the Application Judge granted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement of the Honourable Justice Koehnen dated March 3, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Reasons</BOLD>&rdquo;) at paragraphs 2-3, Motion Record of the Applicants (&ldquo;<BOLD>Applicants' Record</BOLD>&rdquo;) at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. In their written submissions, the applicants argued that the respondents should not be entitled to costs because they had represented themselves, and had provided no evidence of lost opportunity costs associated with that self-representation. The applicants submitted that lawyers who act for themselves can only recover costs if they can demonstrate that they have been taken away from otherwise remunerative work in order to represent themselves. Even then, the applicants stated that any recovery should be &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; and there should be no recovery for any time that a litigant would ordinarily be required to spend in the course of litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 4, Applicants' Record at Tab 8; Responding Costs Submissions of the Applicants, Applicants' Record at Tab 3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>7. The respondents replied and included affidavits of the individual respondents attesting to the fact that, had they not been required to spend time responding to the application, they would have spent the time on remunerative client work, and that they had turned away work as a result of this litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 5, Applicants' Record at Tab 8; Affidavit of Fred Tayar affirmed February 26, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Tayar Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;) at paragraphs 2&ndash;4, Applicants' Record at Tab 5; Affidavit of Colby Linthwaite affirmed February 26, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Linthwaite Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;) at paragraphs 2-3, Applicants' Record at Tab 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. The applicants chose not to cross-examine on the affidavits.</P>
<P>9. Instead, the applicants filed sur-reply in which they submitted that the respondents' affidavits did not provide sufficient detail concerning the prospective clients on whose files they could have worked, how much income they would have earned from those files, and the lawyers to whom those files were referred. The applicants also submitted that the respondents could have worked on weekends or in the evening to respond to the application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 6, Applicants' Record at Tab 8; Further Responding Costs Submissions of the Applicants, Applicants' Record at Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>12. Thus, to succeed the applicants must demonstrate that it is &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; that there are &ldquo;strong grounds&rdquo; upon which this Court could find that the Application Judge erred in exercising his discretion. Stated differently, the applicants have the burden of showing that this is one of the rare cases in which a Court exercising deference to the judge of first instance could find that he was &ldquo;plainly wrong&rdquo;. The applicants cannot discharge this burden.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Issue Two: The Granting of Costs to a Self-Represented Lawyer</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Law</EM></TI>
<P>13. The applicants have ignored both the letter and the spirit of the binding case, which is this Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fong v. Chan</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>(1999) 46 O.R. (3d) 330 (CA), Book of Authorities of the Applicants (&ldquo;<BOLD>Applicants' Authorities</BOLD>&rdquo;) at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Fong</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). In that decision, Justice Sharpe carefully reviewed the jurisprudence concerning the granting of costs to self-represented lawyers, and concluded as follows.
<QUOTE><P><EM>21 It is apparent from this review of the case law that the preponderance of modern authority supports the contention that both self-represented lawyers and self-represented lay litigants may be awarded costs and that such costs may include allowances for counsel fees. [...]</EM></P>
<P><EM>22 Quite apart from authority and as a matter of principle, it seems to me to be difficult to justify a categorical rule denying recovery of costs by self-represented litigants. As noted in Fellowes McNeil, supra and in Skidmore, supra, modern cost rules are designed to foster three fundamental purposes: (1) to indemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation; (2) to encourage settlements; and (3) to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants. It seems to me that all three purposes are fostered by allowing the trial judge a discretion to award costs to self-represented litigants</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[...]</EM></P>
<P><EM>24 A rule precluding recovery of costs, in whole or in part, by self-represented litigants would deprive the court of a potentially useful tool to encourage settlements and to discourage or sanction inappropriate behaviour. For example, an opposite party should not be able to ignore the reasonable settlement offer of a self-represented litigant with impunity from the usual costs consequences. Nor, in my view, is it desirable to immunize such a party from costs awards designed to sanction inappropriate behaviour simply because the other party is a self-represented litigant</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>25 I would add that nothing in these reasons is meant to suggest that a self-represented litigant has an automatic right to recover costs. The matter remains fully within the discretion of the trial judge, and as Ellen Macdonald J. observed in Fellows</EM>, <CASEREF><SOC>McNeil v. Kansa</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra, there are undoubtedly cases where it is inappropriate for a lawyer to appear in person, and there will be cases where the self-represented litigant's conduct of the proceedings is inappropriate. The trial judge maintains a discretion to make the appropriate costs award, including denial of costs</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>26 I would also add that self-represented litigants, be they legally trained or not, are not entitled to costs calculated on the same basis as those of the litigant who retains counsel. As the Chorley case, supra, recognized, all litigants suffer a loss of time through their involvement in the legal process. The self-represented litigant should not recover costs for the time and effort that any litigant would have to devote to the case. Costs should only be awarded to those lay litigants who can demonstrate that they devoted time and effort to do the work ordinarily done by a lawyer retained to conduct the litigation, and that as a result, they incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity. As the early Chancery rule recognized, a self-represented lay litigant should receive only a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or&rdquo; reasonable&rdquo; allowance for the loss of time devoted to preparing and presenting the case. This excludes routine awards on a per diem basis to litigants who would ordinarily be in attendance at court in any event. The trial judge is particularly well-placed to assess the appropriate allowance, if any, for a self-represented litigant, and accordingly, the trial judge should either fix the costs when making such an award or provide clear guidelines to the Assessment Officer as to the manner in which the costs are to be assessed</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. This is the law of Ontario, and it emphasizes the discretion of the trial judge. Justice Sharpe cites this discretion, explicitly or implicitly, five times in the above passage, summarized by his holding that &ldquo;<EM>[t]he trial judge is particularly well-placed to assess the appropriate allowance</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> His Honour limits the trial judge's discretion in only two ways.</P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Loss of Opportunity</EM></TI>
<P>15. Firstly, the self-represented lawyer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the trial judge that he incurred an opportunity cost by foregoing remunerative activity in favour of the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Application Judge held that the respondents had met this requirement, as they had filed affidavits &ldquo;<EM>attesting to the fact that, had they not been required to spend time responding to this application, they would have spent the time on remunerative client work</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraphs 7-8, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicants do not challenge this finding. Instead, they allege error in findings that do not exist.</P>
<P>16. In paragraphs 15 and 16 of their factum, the applicants incorrectly suggest that the respondents have been awarded costs for time taken away from family or for reduced quality of life. The respondents made no such claim, and were given no such award. Each of the affidavits affirmed that the time spent on the application had been spent during normal business hours.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tayar Affidavit at paragraph 2, Applicants' Record at Tab 5; Linthwaite Affidavit at paragraph 2, Applicants' Record at Tab 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Application Judge's holding concerning work on weekends<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 10, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (quoted in the applicants' paragraph 16) was in response to a different argument made by the applicants, being that the individual respondents <EM>should have</EM> spent weekends responding to the application, rather than working hours, as this would have allowed the applicants to claim that the respondents were not entitled to any costs whatsoever.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Further Responding Costs Submissions of the Applicants, at paragraphs 6 and 8, Applicants' Record at Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (There is, of course, no jurisprudential support for this posited obligation to spend personal time on lawsuits.)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Neither of the cases cited by the applicants on this point, being <CASEREF><SOC>Tiago v Meisels</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5090</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Logenberg v ING Insurance Co.</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>167 A.C.W.S. (3d) 655</CITE></CASEREF>, says anything of the sort. <EM>Tiago</EM> holds that costs cannot be awarded for personal time in the absence of evidence of lost opportunity costs (at paragraph 9). <EM>Logenberg</EM> holds that &ldquo;there is no authority to award costs for time taken away from family, or for a reduced quality of life, as claimed by the Plaintiff&rdquo; (at paragraph 35).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. In paragraph 17 of their factum, the applicants assert that the Application Judge's &ldquo;<EM>approach of valuing a lawyer's time without the need for any particular inquiry places lawyers in a preferred position over and above all other personal litigants</EM>.&rdquo; This &ldquo;<EM>preferred position</EM>&rdquo; argument is later relied upon to suggest that this application raises &ldquo;<EM>a serious question of public policy</EM>&rdquo;, and an &ldquo;<EM>important access to justice issue</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum, at paragraphs 29&ndash;31</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicants are again badly misrepresenting the decision made.</P>
<P>18. The applicants were served with affidavits. If they wanted a &ldquo;<EM>particular inquiry</EM>&rdquo; into the matters affirmed to therein, it was <EM>their responsibility</EM> to perform that inquiry. They chose not to cross-examine, and thereby left that evidence unchallenged. Sending sur-reply to the Application Judge in which they complained about details not included in the affidavits did not invest that Judge with the responsibility to inquire for them, nor did it make those complaints reasonable. There is no jurisprudential support for the idea that in order to establish lost opportunity costs, a self-represented lawyer must, (as was demanded by the applicants) produce month-by-month breakdowns of his income, describe &ldquo;the nature of the prospective files&rdquo;, identify the lawyers to whom the files were referred, or estimate &ldquo;how much income [the respondents] may have earned&rdquo; from foregone files.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Further Responding Costs Submissions of the Applicants, at paragraphs 5 and 7, Applicants' Record at Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[9] The level of detailed information the applicant seek from the respondents about the lost opportunities would begin to infringe on solicitor client privilege. The level of inquiry that the applicant[s] seek to make into the daily affairs of the respondents is, in my view, unreasonable. If lawyers engaged in the full-time practice of law swear affidavits indicating that they have turned away work because of this application and have not been cross-examined [about those] affidavits I am entitled to take them at face value</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 9, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. There is no error here.</P>
<P>20. The applicants' complaint about the delivery of the affidavits in reply is another attempt to avoid the consequences of their choice not to cross-examine.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum at paragraphs 9(c) and 21</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Application Judge asked for submissions from the respondents concerning the issue of opportunity costs. The applicants have never suggested that he exceeded his jurisdiction in doing so. The respondents provided those submissions, in the form of the affidavits. The applicants now object that &ldquo;<EM>[p]roviding affidavit evidence by way of reply enabled the Respondents to come up with a statement vague enough not to be examined carefully, but that nonetheless managed to address the exact issues raised by the Applicants in their submissions</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum at paragraph 21</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Again, if the applicants had wanted the affidavits &ldquo;<EM>to be examined carefull</EM>&rdquo;, they could have examined the deponents under oath.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notably, in the case the applicants rely upon for their argument concerning reply evidence, <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Lansdowne v Ottawa</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 1015</CITE></CASEREF>, the &ldquo;reply&rdquo; affidavits were not struck, (at paragraphs 56 and 60-61) and the Court held that &ldquo;[a]ny unfairness to the respondent can be addressed by permitting a &ldquo;sur-reply&rdquo; (at paragraph 58). The applicants in this matter delivered a sur-reply.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>A Reasonable Allowance</EM></TI>
<P>21. The second limitation on the trial judge's discretion established by <EM>Fong</EM> is as follows. Justice Sharpe, citing earlier English jurisprudence, directed that a self-represented lay litigant should receive a &ldquo;<EM>moderate</EM>&rdquo; or&rdquo; <EM>reasonable</EM>&rdquo; allowance for the loss of time devoted to preparing and presenting the case. He held that <EM>&ldquo;[t]his excludes routine awards on a per diem basis to litigants who would ordinarily be in attendance at court in any event&rdquo;</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Beyond ruling out <EM>per diems</EM>, Justice Sharpe did not define &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; in this passage.</P>
<P>22. The respondents submit that Justice Sharpe's larger analysis means that the reasonableness of a costs award is to be measured against His Honour's &ldquo;<EM>three fundamental purposes</EM>&rdquo; for costs awards: (1) to indemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation; (2) to encourage settlements; and (3) to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 22, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is precisely what the Application Judge did.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Indemnity</EM></TI>
<P>23. The Application Judge held that the hourly rates sought by the respondents were &ldquo;<EM>moderate and reasonable</EM>&rdquo;, and that the allocation of time spent between junior and senior counsel was reasonable, as was the time spent on individual tasks.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraphs 12-13, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicants do not challenge these findings. Further:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[14] While the time may at first blush seem high, the respondents have provided a satisfactory explanation for the time involved. They were required to cross-examine the applicants on two occasions because the applicants filed supplementary affidavits substantially changing the basis on which they sought relief, there was extensive delay by the applicants requiring multiple preparation sessions, [and] the respondents had to reconstruct their litigation file from computer records because they had transferred the entire file to the applicants at their request which file the applicants subsequently destroyed</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 14, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. Justice Sharpe's statement that legally-trained litigants are &ldquo;<EM>not entitled to costs calculated on the same basis as those of the litigant who retains counsel</EM>&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> does <EM>not</EM> establish that a self-represented lawyer cannot claim indemnity based upon her normal hourly rate. It establishes that not all the time spent by a self-represented lawyer is recoverable. The basis of calculation Justice Sharpe had in mind was the model whereby a client receives an account for the total time spent by the lawyer on her matter, and the client then claims a proportion of that sum in costs. However, that model does not comfortably apply to an individual who is both lawyer and client. Justice Sharpe was clear that a lawyer cannot recover for client work, (&ldquo;<EM>the time and effort that any litigant would have to devote</EM>&rdquo;) but can recover for legal work (&ldquo;<EM>the work ordinarily done by a lawyer retained to conduct the litigation</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>Fong</EM> does not say that a trial judge cannot award indemnity for <EM>legal work</EM> measured against an hourly rate, as in the normal course. Instead, it emphasizes the trial judge's discretion to set the &ldquo;<EM>appropriate allowance</EM>&rdquo;, without including <EM>per diems</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 26, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. The Application Judge dealt with the issue of client vs. legal time directly:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[15] The applicants produced a schedule in which they have eliminated large amounts of time of the respondents on the basis that a self-represented lawyer should not recover costs for any tasks performed that a client would typically perform. The time the applicants have eliminated in this regard includes time reviewing application material and preparing responding material. It would be the rare client who reviews application material in sufficient detail to prepare a response and the even rarer a client who actually prepares the response</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraph 15, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. The applicants do not challenge this finding. Instead, they advance an argument on indemnity which is implicitly contrary to <EM>Fong</EM>; for this reason, they make only passing reference to that case in their factum. The applicants argue that there <EM>is</EM> a categorical rule concerning the granting of costs to a self-represented lawyer, being that the judge at first instance has some discretion concerning whether costs are awarded, but none with respect to the quantum, which must be &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum, at paragraphs 13&ndash;15 and 26</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They argue that the Application Judge erred by applying the &ldquo;moderate and reasonable&rdquo; standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum, at paragraphs 9(a) and 14</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The practical result of implementing the applicants' proposed &ldquo;nominal costs&rdquo; rule would be that when the successful party is self-represented, the losing party is immunized from a meaningful costs award, no matter its conduct. The applicants' position is therefore flatly contradictory to Justice Sharpe's holding that &ldquo;<EM>[a] rule precluding recovery of costs, in whole or in part, by self-represented litigants would deprive the court of a potentially useful tool to encourage settlements and to discourage or sanction inappropriate behaviour</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fong</EM>, at paragraph 24, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. The word &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; does not appear in <EM>Fong</EM>. It appears in a Divisional Court case which follows <CASEREF><SOC>Fong, Mustang Investigations Inc. v. Ironside</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2010 ONSC 3444 (Divisional Court), Applicants' Authorities at Tab 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The term was not used in a considered manner, but seems to have been introduced into the decision almost by accident.</P>
<P>29. After setting an action down for trial, Mustang Investigations moved for leave to discontinue the matter against the self-represented Mr. Ironside. Justice Perell of the Superior Court granted leave to discontinue, and held that Ironside was entitled to costs of the motion. Justice Perell invited written submissions on costs, and held that:
<QUOTE><P><EM>If Mr. Ironside does not submit written submissions within 30 days, he shall be paid nominal costs, which I fix at the sum of $5,000.00, all inclusive</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations Inc. v.

With respect to the quantum of Ironside's costs, Justice Perell held:
<QUOTE><P><EM>24 Rather than reflecting with mathematical precision the actual costs incurred by the successful litigant, the amount of costs should be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, which may be determined, in part, by considering the reasonable expectations of the parties, most particularly the unsuccessful party [citations omitted]</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>25 In my opinion, Mustang could reasonable expect to pay costs of approximately $20,000 for counsel fee on a partial indemnity basis for bringing Mr. Ironside before the court and compelling him to respond to the various interlocutory motions, including the very serious matter of having him cited for contempt</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. In the result, Justice Perell awarded costs of $21,051.40, all inclusive.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mustang Investigations Inc. v. Ironside</SOC><CITE>[2009] O.J.

<P><EM>27 As I have said, Master Dash, and several trial judges, seem to have interpreted Fong as saying that even in the absence of proof of an opportunity cost, one may assume that because the lay person was involved in the litigation preparing material that might otherwise be prepared by a lawyer, he or she should nevertheless be entitled to nominal costs. With great respect to the Master and those judges, I'm unable to find that the language in Fong permits an award to be made without the self-represented litigant demonstrating that, as a result of the lawyer-like work put in on the file, remunerative activity was foregone. Simply stated, no proof of opportunity cost, no nominal costs available</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>

No. 4547</CITE></CASEREF> (Master) at paragraph 20, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Jennings appears to have obtained &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; from Justice Perell's initial decision and then used it where he actually intended &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. Subsequent appellate cases have not spoken to this discontinuity in terms.</P>
<P>33. Even if the Application Judge was truly faced with two different standards (&ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, per this Court, and &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, per the Divisional Court), he was bound by the higher authority.</P>
<P>34. Concerning quantum, three of the four cases cited by the applicants (<CASEREF><SOC>Huard v. Hydro One Networks Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>White v Ritchie</SOC></CASEREF>, and <CASEREF><SOC>Henderson v. Pearlman</SOC></CASEREF>) concern self-represented lay litigants, not self-represented lawyers, and so are of no relevance to this motion. In the third case, <EM>Sydney Charendoff</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sydney Charendoff et al v Alec McLennan and 124155 Ontario Inc. et al</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 7241</CITE><COURTJUR>Sup.

Further, the lawyer was criticized by the court for his approach to the motion, which the court held had led to &ldquo;a <EM>great deal of expense and time [that] could have been saved</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sidney Charendoff</EM>, at paragraph 19, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 10</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Even so, the court would have (but for the absence of evidence concerning opportunity costs) awarded the lawyer $3,000 in costs for a straightforward motion to set aside a default judgment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sidney Charendoff</EM>, at paragraph 19, Applicants' Authorities at Tab 10</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such an award would be far from &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;. Further, this is a decision of a judge with jurisdiction coordinate to that of the Application Judge. It could not, therefore, limit the discretion of the Application Judge to determine the appropriate costs allowance to be made on the facts before him.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>35. The applicants have chosen not to challenge the second basis for the Application Judge's award.
<QUOTE><P><EM>[16] The application and my reasons for dismissing it also bear on the appropriateness of the cost award</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[...]</EM></P>
<P><EM>[20] Bringing an application that is entirely without foundation is ordinarily the basis for an award of substantial indemnity costs. If there were in fact any time that should be discounted because the respondents were acting as clients (which I am not agreeing there was), the respondents are more than compensated for that in the difference between the partial indemnity costs being awarded and the substantial indemnity award that would, in my view, ordinarily apply to the circumstances</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, at paragraphs 16 and 20, Applicants' Record at Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. This holding represents a &ldquo;fundamental purpose&rdquo; or basis for the costs award which is independent of straightforward indemnity, and which can itself justify the award. Stated differently, it is an alternative discretionary statement of the award's reasonableness, which should sustain the award even if this Court were to set aside the Application Judge's indemnity analysis.</P>
<P>37. As the applicants have not asserted that this holding is incorrect (their notice of appeal and factum are silent on the point, and they did not appeal the dismissal of the application), the necessary result should be dismissal of the motion.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
