<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY TO THE NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Appeal in the matter of section 85 of the <EM>Corporations Tax Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. C.40, as amended (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>CTA</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), for the taxation year ending on January 2, 2008 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2008 Year</BOLD>&rdquo;), the Attorney General of Canada (&ldquo;<BOLD>AGC</BOLD>&rdquo;) says:</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The AGC admits the allegations of fact contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 and 17 of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>2. The AGC denies the allegations of fact contained in paragraph 15 of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>3. In respect of paragraph 6 of the Notice of Appeal, the AGC denies that the tax returns for the 2010 Taxation Year were filed on June 30, 2010 and says that they were filed on June 25, 2010. The AGC admits the other allegation of fact contained in that paragraph.</P>
<P>4. In respect of paragraph 11 of the Notice of Appeal, the AGC admits that the Appellant objected to the Federal Reassessments, but says that the Appellant did so on September 24, 2013.</P>
<P>5. In respect of paragraph 13 of the Notice of Appeal, the AGC says that the objections were allowed in part and admits the other allegations of fact contained in that paragraph.</P>
<P>6. The AGC admits that the allegations of fact contained in paragraph 14 of the Notice of Appeal, but says that the amount of tax payable admitted is not the amount of tax payable for the purposes of ss. 79(7) and 82(5) of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P>
<P>7. The AGC denies all other allegations of fact contained in the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Respondent's assumptions</TI>
<P>8. In determining the Appellant's liability to tax for the 2008 Year, the Respondent made the assumptions of fact set out below in paragraphs 9 through 34.</P>
<P>9. On June 12, 2008, the Respondent first assessed the Appellant under the <EM>CTA</EM> for the 2008 Year for income tax payable of $4,050,980 and capital tax payable of $41,802.</P>
<P>10. On December 8, 2008, the Respondent reassessed the Appellant under the <EM>CTA</EM> for the 2008 Year to reduce capital tax payable to $33,002.</P>
<P>11. On June 25, 2010, the Appellant filed a corporate tax return for both federal and Ontario purposes for its taxation year ended January 2, 2010 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2010 Year</BOLD>&rdquo;), reporting a loss of $14,498,947.</P>
<P>12. On the same date, the Appellant requested that part of this non-capital loss, in the amount of $4,000,000 be carried back to its 2008 Year (&ldquo;<BOLD>Loss Carryback</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>13. The Minister of National Revenue (&ldquo;<BOLD>Federal Minister</BOLD>&rdquo;) assessed the Appellant's tax liability for the 2010 under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.)(&ldquo;<BOLD>Federal Act</BOLD>&rdquo;) as filed.</P>
<P>14. The Federal Minister also allowed the Appellant's request for the Loss Carryback. Accordingly, the Federal Minister reassessed the Appellant for the 2008 Year to allow the deduction of the Loss Carryback in computing the Appellant's taxable income for that year under the Federal Act.</P>
<P>15. Notice of this federal reassessment for the 2008 Year was dated September 16, 2010 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2010 Federal Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>16. As a result of the 2010 Federal Reassessment, the Respondent also reassessed the Appellant under the <EM>CTA</EM> for the 2008 Year to allow the deduction of the Loss Carryback in computing the Appellant's taxable income for that year.</P>
<P>17. Notice of this reassessment was dated November 24, 2010 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2010 Ontario Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>18. This 2010 Ontario Reassessment resulted in a reduction of the Appellant's income tax payable for the 2008 Year and a refund of $560,000 to the Appellant on December 19, 2010 with no interest.</P>
<P>19. The Federal Minister later reassessed the Appellant's tax liability under the Federal Act, reversing the previously allowed Loss Carryback in its entirety.</P>
<P>20. Notice of this federal reassessment was dated July 3, 2013 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2013 Federal Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>21. Following the 2013 Federal Reassessment, the Respondent reassessed the Appellant's tax liability under the <EM>CTA</EM> for the 2008 Year to reverse the previously allowed Loss Carryback in its entirety.</P>
<P>22. Notice of this reassessment was dated July 22, 2013 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2013 Ontario Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>23. The 2013 Ontario Reassessment was a designated assessment within the meaning of s. 92 of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P>
<P>24. The 2013 Ontario Reassessment reinstated the income tax payable of $560,000 that the Respondent had previously refunded to the Appellant.</P>
<P>25. Under the 2013 Ontario Reassessment for the 2008 Year:
<P1>a) the Appellant had capital tax payable of $33,002;</P1>
<P1>b) the Appellant was denied the deduction in computing taxable income of the Loss Carryback in the amount of $4,000,000;</P1>
<P1>c) the Appellant had taxable income of $28,959,711;</P1>
<P1>d) the Appellant had income tax payable of $4,054,360; and,</P1>
<P1>e) the Appellant had total tax payable of $4,087,362 (<EM>i.e.</EM>, income tax payable of $4,054,360 + capital tax payable of $33,002).</P1></P>
<P>26. On October 11, 2013, the Appellant made a payment of $668,801.75 to the Respondent, which was payment of this $560,000 in tax payable plus $104,601.75 in additional interest charged.</P>
<P>27. The Appellant did not object to the 2013 Ontario Reassessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The Appellant was not required to object. As the Appellant chose not to object to this designated assessment, but did object to the 2013 Federal Reassessment, then both the Appellant and the Respondent were bound by the Federal Minister's decision on the 2013 Federal Reassessment in accordance with s. 92(2) of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. On September 24, 2013, the Appellant objected to the 2013 Federal Reassessment.</P>
<P>29. In response to the objection, the Federal Minister reassessed the Appellant's tax liability under the Federal Act to reinstate the Loss Carryback in its entirety.</P>
<P>30. Notice of this federal reassessment was dated August 14, 2015 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2015 Federal Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>31. Following the 2015 Federal Reassessment, the Respondent reassessed the Appellant's tax liability under the <EM>CTA</EM> for the 2008 Year to reinstate the Loss Carryback in its entirety.</P>
<P>32. Notice of this reassessment was dated September 22, 2015 (&ldquo;<BOLD>2015 Ontario Reassessment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>33. Under the 2015 Ontario Reassessment, the Respondent allowed the Loss Carryback and, as a result, the Appellant had total tax payable of $3,527,362 ($3,494,360 in income tax payable and $33,002 in capital tax payable).</P>
<P>34. The 2015 Ontario Reassessment resulted in a refund to the Appellant of $663,128.84.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>ISSUE TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P>35. The issues are:
<P1>a) whether the Appellant is entitled to an enhanced rate of interest on the refund in respect of its 2008 Year, and</P1>
<P1>b) if the Appellant is so entitled, whether it is also entitled to pre&mdash;and post-judgment interest under ss. 128 and 129 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. C.43.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON, AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>36. The AGC relies on ss. 1(1), 34(1), 79(7), 80, 82 and 92 of the <EM>CTA</EM>, s. 503 of RRO 1990, Reg. 183 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Regulations</BOLD>&rdquo;) and ss. 111 and 248(1) (definition of &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;) of the Federal Act.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>No entitlement to an enhanced rate of interest</TI>
<P>37. The Respondent correctly calculated the interest payable to the Appellant. The Appellant was not entitled to the enhanced rate of interest prescribed for the purposes of s. 82(5) of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P>
<P>38. Generally speaking, pursuant to ss. 503(2)4 and 4.1 of the Regulations, where the Respondent must pay interest to a corporation, it pays interest at amount that is less than the &ldquo;base rate&rdquo;, the base rate being a rate based on an average prime rate.</P>
<P>39. However, under s. 82(5) of the <EM>CTA</EM>, the Respondent must pay an enhanced rate of interest&mdash;the relevant base rate&mdash;where:
<P1>a) the corporation objects to a reassessment for a particular taxation year;</P1>
<P1>b) it is finally determined that the corporation's tax payable for that year is less than the amount assessed under s. 80 of the <EM>CTA</EM>; and,</P1>
<P1>c) as a result, either:
<P2>(i) a surplus, as defined in s. 82(7) of the <EM>CTA</EM>, in the corporation's tax account arises for the particular taxation year, or,</P2>
<P2>(ii) a surplus, as defined in s. 83(2) of the <EM>CTA</EM>, arises in the corporation's instalment account for the particular taxation year.</P2></P1></P>
<P>40. The enhanced interest rate is prescribed for the purposes of s. 82(5) in s. 503(2)5 of the Regulations. It applies only to the surplus attributable to the determination made on the objection.</P>
<P>41. The corporation's tax account represents the balance of any unpaid amounts (tax or other amounts such as penalties) or overpayments relating to a taxation year, as adjusted for interest.</P>
<P>42. The corporation's instalment account measures whether a corporation has unpaid, underpaid, or overpaid instalments of tax at any particular time during the instalment period. The instalment period starts on the first day of the taxation year and ends on the day which is the earlier of the date of the most current assessment or reassessment for the year, and the day before the balance of tax is due for the year, as required by s. 78(2) of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P>
<P>43. For the purposes of computing interest under s. 82(5), the tax payable by the corporation is deemed to be the amount determined as if a loss carried back from a subsequent taxation year had not been deducted. This deeming rule is found in s. 79(7) of the <EM>CTA</EM>.</P>
<P>44. Although the Appellant was successful in objecting to the 2013 Federal Reassessment (which successful objection applied to the 2013 Ontario Reassessment), it cannot benefit from the enhanced interest rate under s. 82(5). The objection did not result in a decision that reduced the Appellant's tax payable, as deemed by s. 79(7) of the <EM>CTA</EM>, to an amount that was less than the amount assessed under the 2013 Ontario Reassessment. For the purpose of calculating interest under s. 82(5):
<P1>a) under the 2013 Ontario Reassessment, the Respondent reassessed the Appellant total tax payable of $4,088,182 (i.e., income tax payable of $4,087,362 + capital tax payable of $33,002) for the 2008 Year, and</P1>
<P1>b) following its objection to the 2013 Federal Reassessment, and as a result of the 2015 Ontario Reassessment, the Appellant still had the same total tax payable of $4,088,182 for the 2008 Year. To reiterate, under s. 79(7), the Loss Carryback did not reduce the total tax payable for the purposes of calculating interest under s. 82(5).</P1></P>
<P>45. For the purpose of calculating interest, then, there is no difference between the amount assessed by the Respondent and the amount of tax payable resulting from the resolution of the objection. Subsection 82(5), with its enhanced rate of interest, does not apply.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>No entitlement to pre- and post-judgment interest under the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM></TI>
<P>46. If the Appellant is successful on its appeal to this Court, it is not entitled to pre&mdash;and post-judgment interest under ss. 128 and 129 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>. The <EM>CTA</EM> would itself provide for interest. Pursuant to ss. 128(4)(g) and 129(4), neither ss. 128 or 129 would have any application.</P>
<P>The AGC requests that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Paragraph 79(7)(a) of the <EM>Corporations Tax Act</EM> provides that, for the purposes of calculating interest to be allowed to a corporation under s. 82, tax payable is deemed to be the amount of tax payable without taking into account a loss carried back to that year from a later year.</P>
<P>2. Subsection 82(5) provides for the use of an enhanced interest rate where the corporation successfully objects to, or appeals from, an assessment. The enhanced interest rate is applied, more precisely, where the tax payable from the successful objection or appeal is less than the tax payable as assessed by the Minister.</P>
<P>3. The Appellant objected to a reassessment denying it a loss carryback. The Appellant's objection was successful and the Minister allowed the loss carryback. However, the Appellant cannot benefit from the enhanced rate of interest.</P>
<P>4. The deeming definition of tax payable in s. 79(7)(a) applies to s. 82(5) because s. 82(5) is integral to the mathematical procedure for calculating of interest under the Act. As a result of the application of s. 79(7)(a), there was no difference between the tax payable as reassessed by the Minister before the objection and the tax payable as reassessed by the Minister after the objection.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">I. FACTS</TI>
<P>5. The facts are set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts. It is useful to highlight certain of them:
<P1>a) The Appellant carried a non-capital loss of $4 million back from the taxation year ended January 2, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>2010 Year</BOLD>&rdquo;) to the taxation year ended January 2, 2008 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>2008 Year</BOLD>&rdquo;), the year under appeal for federal purposes under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSC 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> supp.).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<BOLD>Federal Act</BOLD>&rdquo;) and for provincial purposes under the <EM>Corporations Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSO 1990, c. C.40, as it read at the time.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<BOLD>CTA</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Agreed Statement of Facts, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>b) Following a federal reassessment of the 2008 Year denying the loss carryback, the Minister<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Responsibility for the administration of the CTA has been assigned to either of the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Revenue over the years. The reference to Minister will refer to the relevant minister at any given time.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reassessed the Appellant under the CTA and denied this loss carryback of $4 million.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Agreed Statement of Facts, paras 8-9 and Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>c) The Appellant objected to the federal reassessment. Ultimately, the Appellant was successful on the federal objection and the non-capital loss carryback of $4 million was reinstated for federal purposes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Agreed Statement of Facts, paras 10, 12 and 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>d) The Minister was bound by this result. He reassessed the Appellant to reinstate the non-capital loss carryback of $4 million for Ontario purposes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Agreed Statement of Facts, para 14 and Appendix C. Because the Ontario reassessment was designated under s. 92 of the CTA, the Appellant was not required to object to the Ontario reassessment if it objected to the related federal reassessment. Both the Minister and the Appellant were bound by the resolution of the related federal reassessment.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>e) As a result of this reassessment, the Minister issued a refund to the Appellant, without refund interest.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>6. The Minister did not allow the Appellant the enhanced interest rate under s. 82(5) of the CTA. However, the Minister did give credit interest to the Appellant. This credit interest is shown on the face of the notice of reassessment found at Appendix C of the Agreed Statement of Facts.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">II. POINT IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>7. The question posed by the Appellant in its Notice of Motion is:
<QUOTE><P>Whether, in determining a corporation's entitlement to an enhanced refund interest rate under subsection 82(5) of the [CTA], <EM>tax payable</EM> must take a deduction from a loss carried back into account ...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. The question can be put another way: does the deemed definition of tax payable in s. 79(7)(a) apply to s. 82(5) of the CTA?</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">III. SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>THE ENHANCED RATE OF INTEREST DOES NOT APPLY TO THE SURPLUS IN THE APPELLANT'S TAX ACCOUNT</TI>
<P>9. The deemed definition of tax payable in s. 79(7)(a) applies to s. 82(5) of the CTA. As a result, the Appellant cannot benefit from the enhanced interest rate under s. 82(5).</P></BLOCK3>

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>THE TEXT SHOW THAT THE DEFINITION OF TAX PAYABLE IN S. 79(7)(a) APPLIES WHERE ANY PART OF SS. 79, 82 OR 83 IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CALCULATING INTEREST</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>1)</N><TI>The text of s. 79(7) of the CTA</TI>
<P>11. Subsection 79(7) provides two deeming rules to deal with, among other things, the impact of a loss on the calculation of interest for the taxation year to which the loss is carried back. It reads as follows:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(7)</N><TI>Effect of loss carried back</TI><SSECP>For the purposes of calculating interest payable or allowed under this section or section 82 or 83 in respect of a particular taxation year, and for the purpose of determining the amount of a penalty, if any, to be assessed under subsection 76 (1) or (2) and the amount of tax payable under subsections 78 (4) and (6),
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>the tax payable by the corporation under this Act for a taxation year shall be deemed to be the amount that would otherwise be determined if all amounts deducted by the corporation for that year under section 111 of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada), as it applies for the purposes of this Act, in respect of a loss for a taxation year after the particular year (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;loss year&rdquo;) were not deducted; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the amount, if any, by which the tax payable by the corporation under this Act for the particular taxation year is reduced as a result of a deduction referred to in clause (a) shall be deemed to be an amount paid by the corporation on account of its liability under this Act for the particular year on the day that is the latest of,
<SPARA><N>(i)</N><SPARAP>the first day of the taxation year after the loss year,</SPARAP></SPARA>
<SPARA><N>(ii)</N><SPARAP>the day on which the corporation's return for the loss year is delivered to the Minister, or</SPARAP></SPARA>
<SPARA><N>(iii)</N><SPARAP>the day on which the Minister receives a request in writing from the corporation to reassess the particular taxation year to take into account the deduction referred to in clause (a).</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. Subsection 111(1) of the Federal Act, which is made applicable to the CTA pursuant to s. 34(1) of that Act,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Subsection 34(1) more precisely makes Division C of Part I of the Federal Act apply. Section 111 of the Federal Act is in that Division.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> allows a corporation to carry back and deduct in computing its taxable income a number of kinds of losses (from the loss year) to an earlier taxation year.</P>
<P>13. Here, the Appellant carried back a non-capital loss. Paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Federal Act allows the corporation to carry back a non-capital loss to any of the three preceding taxation years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The term, &ldquo;non-capital loss&rdquo;, is defined in s. 111(8) of the Federal Act. corporation's loss from various sources, including business or property.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Federal Act, only the corporation may choose the year to which it will apply the non-capital loss.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>CCLI (1994) Inc v Canada</SOC><CITE>2007 FCA 185</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. The ultimate effect of s. 111(1) of the Federal Act is that by allowing the corporation to reduce its taxable income by carrying back a non-capital loss, it also allows the corporation to reduce its tax payable for the year.</P>
<P>16. Under s. 79(7)(a), this reduction of tax payable is not permitted for interest and penalty calculation purposes, as well as for certain payments (this refers to ss. 78(4) and (6)). Paragraph 79(7)(a) deems the tax payable for the year to which the loss is carried back to be the corporation's tax payable as if it had <BOLD>not</BOLD> been reduced by the loss carryback.</P>
<P>17. Paragraph 79(7)(b) deems the amount by which the tax payable of a corporation would otherwise be reduced by the loss carryback to be an amount <BOLD>paid</BOLD> toward tax payable for the year to which the loss is carried back only on the latest of the three dates set out in that paragraph. The latest of these three dates is known as the effective interest date.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2)</N><TI>For certain purposes, the deemed meaning of tax payable in s. 79(7)(a) prevails over the general definition of tax payable in s. 1(1)(d) of the CTA</TI>
<P>18. Subsection 79(7) provides its own deemed definition of tax payable. However, there is already a general definition of tax payable in s. 1(1)(d) of the CTA. Paragraph 1(1)(d) reads in part as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>1.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In this Act and in the application of the provisions of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada) that are by this Act made applicable for the purposes of this Act,

<QUOTE><P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>&ldquo;tax payable&rdquo;, by a corporation or other person under any Part of this Act by or under which provision is made for the assessment of tax, means the tax payable by the corporation or other person as fixed by assessment or reassessment, subject to variation on objection or appeal, if any, in accordance with sections 84 to 92, (&ldquo;imp&oc;t payable&rdquo;)</P></QUOTE></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. Where two provisions are in conflict, the conflict may be avoided by applying the more specific provision instead of the general provision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>National Bank Life Insurance, Life Insurance Co v R</SOC><CITE>2006 FCA 161</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Paragraph 79(7)(a) is more specific than s. 1(1)(d). It applies for limited purposes, among them, for &ldquo;the purposes of calculating interest&rdquo; under ss. 79, 82 and 83 in their entirety&mdash;including s. 82(5). It is therefore necessary to understand the phrase &ldquo;for the purposes of calculating interest&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21. The phrase &ldquo;for the purposes of calculating interest&rdquo; is not defined in the CTA. The dictionary meaning of the verb &ldquo;calculate&rdquo;, is:

<P>22. The mathematical procedure for calculating interest involves multiplying (1) a principal amount by (2) an interest rate over (3) a time period.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3)</N><TI>Conclusion on text</TI>
<P>23. The text of s. 79(7) shows that this subsection is specific to the treatment of loss carrybacks in the calculation of interest. This text does not restrict the application of s. 79(7) to any particular step in, or element of, the mathematical procedure for working out an amount of interest. To the extent that ss. 79, 82 and 83 provide for any step in, or element of, this mathematical procedure, they are for the purposes of calculating interest.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>THE CONTEXT SHOWS THAT EACH PART OF SS. 79, 82 AND 83 THAT IS INTEGRAL TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CALCULATING INTEREST</TI>
<P>24. In the context in which s. 79(7) is found, a provision is for the purposes of calculating interest without setting out the entire mathematical procedure for doing so. No one part of ss. 79, 82 or 83 set out the entire mathematical procedure for working out an amount of interest. However, most of the provisions in these sections are integral to this procedure. Each provision that is integral to this procedure must be for the purposes of calculating interest.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1)</N><TI>Interest payable and interest allowed to a corporation under the CTA</TI>
<P>25. Subsection 79(7)'s immediate context is the framework under the CTA for calculating interest payable by or allowable to a corporation.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>a)</N><TI>Interest on surpluses and deficiencies in a corporation's instalment and tax accounts</TI>
<P>26. Section 79 deals in large part with interest payable by a corporation. Sections 82 and 83 deal in large part with interest allowable by the Minister.</P>
<P>27. In broad terms, who owes interest for any given day depends on whether the corporation has a surplus or deficiency on that day in one of two accounts: the instalment account and the tax account.</P>
<P>28. During the course of a taxation year, the corporation must pay instalments of tax payable for the year: s. 78(2)(a).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The instalments are based on the tax payable for the year, the tax payable for the previous year (called the first instalment base), or the tax payable two years before (called the second instalment base): s. 78(2)(b). The first and second instalment bases are defined in ss. 507(1) and (2) of RRO 1990, Reg. 183. Under s. 507(12) of these Regulations, which operates in much the same way as s. 79(7)(a), the tax payable that forms the instalment base does not take into account the loss carryback.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The amounts owing as instalments of tax payable and any interest on those instalments, less any amounts paid or credited or deemed to have been paid or credited to the amounts owing, are tracked in the corporation's instalment account. If the corporation owes more than it has paid or has had credited toward the amounts it owes, it has a deficiency in its instalment account: s. 79(4.1). If the corporation has paid or has been credited with more than it owes, then there is a surplus in its instalment account: s. 83(2).</P>
<P>29. For any day on which there is a deficiency in the account, the corporation must pay interest: s. 79(4). For any day on which there is a surplus in the account, the Minister must allow interest: s. 83(1).</P>
<P>30. At the end of a taxation year (more precisely, depending on the circumstances, either on or before the end of the second or third month following the year: s. 78(2)(b)), the corporation must pay the balance of its tax payable for the year.</P>
<P>31. The amounts owing as tax payable, penalties and interest, less any amounts paid or credited to those amounts, are tracked in the corporation's tax account. If the corporation owes more than it has paid or had credited to the amounts it owes, it has a deficiency in its tax account: s. 79(2). If the corporation has paid or has been credited with more than it owes, then there is a surplus in the tax account: s. 82(7).</P>
<P>32. For any day on which there is a deficiency in the account, the corporation must pay interest: s. 79(1). For any day on which there is a surplus in the account, the Minister must allow interest.</P>
<P>33. The general rule for the allowance of interest by the Minister is set out in s. 82(4):
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(4)</N><TI>Interest allowed</TI><SSECP>Interest at the rate prescribed by the regulations shall be calculated and allowed daily to a corporation on the surplus in the corporation's tax account for a taxation year, for each day there is a surplus in the tax account after the end of the instalment period for the taxation year.</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. The enhanced interest rate is provided through s. 82(5). This subsection reads as follows:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(5)</N><TI>Interest, after objection or appeal</TI><SSECP>Where, by a decision made under section 84 or 92 or by a court, it is finally determined that the tax payable under this Act by a corporation for a taxation year is less than the amount assessed<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pursuant to s. 1(1)(a) of the CTA, s. 248(1) of the Federal Act generally applies. Under the s. 248(1) definition of assessment, an assessment includes a reassessment.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> under section 80 to which the objection was made or from which the appeal was taken, and as a result of the decision there is a surplus in the corporation's tax account for a taxation year or in the corporation's instalment account for a taxation year, the interest rate prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, and not the rate prescribed for the purposes of subsection (4) or 83 (1), as the case may be, shall be used to determine the amount of interest for the purposes of those subsections, for each day that the surplus in the account is attributable to the decision.</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>b)</N><TI>The prescribed interest rates</TI>
<P>35. Interest rates are prescribed in RRO 1990, Reg. 183, s. 503. Interest rates are adjusted on a quarterly basis, on the adjustment date: s. 503(1). The base rate of interest is the average prime rate at a particular point in time: s. 503(2). The rates are as follows:
<P1>a) 3% higher than the base rate, when the corporation must pay interest: s. 503(2)3;</P1>
<P1>b) 3% lower than the base rate when the Minister must allow interest and s. 82(5) does not apply: s. 503(2)4.1; and</P1>
<P1>c) the base rate itself, when the Minister must allow interest and s. 82(5) applies: s. 503(2)5. This is called the enhanced rate of interest in the Appellant's materials.</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>c)</N><TI>The mathematical procedure under the CTA for calculating interest</TI>
<P>36. Given the framework set out above for the calculation of interest payable or allowable to a corporation under the CTA, in broad terms, the mathematical procedure for calculating interest payable or allowable under the CTA consists of the following steps:
<P1>a) determine the principal amount on which interest accrues&mdash;<EM>i.e.</EM>, determine whether there is a surplus or deficiency on a given day, which requires:
<P2>i) determining the tax payable for the taxation year;</P2>
<P2>ii) determining any other amount payable by the corporation (<EM>e.g.</EM>, interest and penalties);</P2>
<P2>iii) determining the amounts paid by, credited to, or deemed to have been paid or credited to the corporation; and</P2>
<P2>iv) determining the interest allowed to the corporation;</P2></P1>
<P1>b) determine the applicable interest rate; and</P1>
<P1>c) multiply the surplus or deficiency on the given day by the applicable interest rate.</P1></P>
<P>37. The same approach, with slight modifications, applies to the calculation of interest on a deficiency or surplus in the instalment account.</P>
<P>38. Where there is an objection or appeal, s. 82(5) provides (a) in part, as well as (b) and (c) of the mathematical procedure for calculating interest on the surpluses in tax and instalment accounts.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2)</N><TI>No part of ss. 79, 82 and 83 supplies the complete mathematical procedure under the CTA for calculating interest</TI>
<P>39. No part of ss. 79, 82 or 83 sets out this entire mathematical procedure for calculating interest. Most of the provisions in these sections are, however, integral to the procedure. If the Legislature wanted to target only parts of ss. 79, 82 and 83, it could have done so. If the Legislature wanted to limit the application of s. 79(7)(a) to only the part of s. 82 that contained a mathematical procedure that calculated interest at the general rate, it would have been easy enough to target s. 82(4). Until 1994, the Legislature <BOLD>did</BOLD> target s. 82(4) (and its predecessors) in s. 79(7) (and its predecessors).</P>
<BLOCK5><N>a)</N><TI>Section 79</TI>
<P>40. Section 79 contains subsections that refer to the calculation of interest. Subsection 79(1) reads in part: &ldquo;Interest ... shall be calculated and charged daily and be payable by a corporation ...&rdquo; Subsection 79(4) reads in part: &ldquo;... the corporation is liable to pay interest ... calculated and charged daily on ...&rdquo; Subsection (4.01) contains the same language as subsection (4).</P>
<P>41. None of these subsections is sufficient in and of itself to calculate an amount of interest.</P>
<P>42. Take s. 79(1). It tells us which interest rate to apply to a deficiency in the tax account over a particular period (each day). Subsection 79(1) does not tell us how to calculate the deficiency. We need to look at s. 79(2). Other subsections define elements of the deficiency calculation (e.g., s. 79(3)&ndash;(3.2), (10)) or limit the interest payables by a corporation (s. 79(9)). No part of s. 79 provides the entire mathematical procedure for calculating interest payable by the corporation. All parts of s. 79 are integral to this procedure.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>b)</N><TI>Section 82</TI>
<P>43. Unlike s. 79, some parts of s. 82 have no bearing on the mathematical procedure for calculating interest. Subsections 82(1), (2), (3), (8) and (11) relate to the refund or other application of overpayments. While interest payable by or allowable to a corporation under ss. 79(1) and 82(4) or (5) is included in the calculation of an overpayment, ss. 82(1), (2), (3), (8) and (11) do not themselves provide any element of the interest calculation. These subsections cannot be for the purposes of calculating interest.</P>
<P>44. Only one subsection in s. 82 uses any variation of the word &ldquo;calculate&rdquo;: This is s. 82(4) itself: &ldquo;Interest ... shall be calculated at the rate prescribed by regulations ...&rdquo;</P>
<P>45. Putting aside s. 82(5) for the moment, the rest of s. 82 provides <BOLD>parts</BOLD> of the mathematical procedure for calculating interest. Subsection 82(4) tells us that the general interest rate applies to a surplus in the tax account over a particular period (daily). This subsection does not tell us what the interest rate is. For this, we need to look at s. 503(5) of the Regulations.</P>
<P>46. Subsection 82(1) also does not tell us how to calculate the surplus. We need to look at s. 82(7). And, to calculate the surplus, s. 82(7) takes us to ss. 79(2)(a) and (b). There are also other subsections that tell us the first day on which interest on a surplus becomes allowable (s. 83(6)) or that limits the total interest allowable over a certain period (s. 83(9)-(10)). Each of these subsections is integral to the calculation of interest, but none of them is sufficient to calculate this interest.</P>
<P>47. Taking s. 82(5) into account, in certain circumstances, this subsection tells us that a different interest rate may apply and that this interest rate applies only to the surplus in the tax account attributed to a decision on an objection or appeal. It also uses language similar to that of s. 82(4) without using a variation of the word calculate: &ldquo;... the interest rate prescribed by the regulations ... shall be used to determine the amount of interest ...&rdquo; It is also integral to the calculation of interest.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>c)</N><TI>Section 83</TI>
<P>48. No part of s. 83 provides the entire mathematical procedure for calculating interest. No part even uses a variation of the word &ldquo;calculate&rdquo;. Subsection 83(1) provides: &ldquo;Interest ... shall be computed ...&rdquo; Putting aside s. 82(5), s. 83(1) tells us that a particular interest rate applies to a surplus in the instalment account over a particular period (each day). This subsection does not tell us what the interest rate is. For this, we need to look at s. 503(5) of the Regulations. Subsection 83(1) also does not tell us how to calculate the surplus. We need to look at s. 83(2). And, to calculate the surplus, s. 83(2) takes us to ss. 79(4.1)(a) and (b). Each of these subsections is integral to the calculation of interest, but none of them is sufficient to calculate this interest.</P>
<P>49. Taking s. 82(5) into account, in certain circumstances, this subsection tells us that a different interest rate may apply and that this interest rate applies only to the surplus in the instalment account attributed to a decision on an objection or appeal.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3)</N><TI>Paragraph 79(7)(a)'s deemed definition works only if it applies to any provision in ss. 79, 82 or 85 that is integral to the calculation of interest</TI>
<P>50. Paragraph 79(7)(a) provides a deemed definition of tax payable. Therefore, it applies where tax payable is relevant to the calculation of interest. None of the provisions that require a corporation to pay interest (<EM>e.g.</EM>, s. 79(1)), or that allow interest to a corporation refer to tax payable (<EM>i.e.</EM>, ss. 82(4) and 83(1)). The only way s. 79(7)(a) works is if it applies to <BOLD>any</BOLD> provision that is integral to the calculation of interest, even if it does not provide the complete mathematical procedure for working out an amount of interest.</P>
<P>51. In ss. 79, 82 and 83, there are few references to tax payable. Section 79 refers to tax payable only in determining whether a corporation has a deficiency in its tax account, under s. 79(2). The <BOLD>only</BOLD> reference to tax payable in section 82 is in s. 82(5). In defining surplus in a tax account, s. 82(7) refers us back to s. 79(2), which itself refers to tax payable. Section 83 does not refer to tax payable at all.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>4)</N><TI>The other provisions to which s. 79(7) applies also do not contain complete or self-contained mathematical procedures</TI>
<P>52. Subsection 79(7) also applies to the determination of amounts of penalties under ss. 76(1) and (2) and tax payable under ss. 78(4) and (6). Like ss. 79, 82 and 83, these four subsections do not contain complete mathematical procedures.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>a)</N><TI>Late-filing penalties under s. 76(1) and (2)</TI>
<P>53. These two provisions impose penalties for the late filing of an income tax return under the CTA. Subsection 76(1) applies a penalty for failing to file a return on a timely basis for the first time. Subsection 76(2) applies a penalty for repeated failures to file.</P>
<P>54. Each of these subsections sets out a mathematical procedure for calculating a penalty, even using the word &ldquo;formula&rdquo;:
<P1>a) In subsection (1): &ldquo;Every corporation ... is liable to a penalty in the amount calculated using the formula ...&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>b) In subsection (2): &ldquo;Every corporation ... is liable to a penalty determined in accordance with the following formula ...&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>55. As with ss. 79, 82 and 83, even these formulas for calculating penalties are incomplete. The penalties are based on the deficiency in the corporation's tax account. Subsections 76(1) and (2) do not tell us how to calculate the deficiency. We need to look at s. 79(2). Under s. 79(2)(a), one element of this deficiency is the tax payable by the corporation.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>b)</N><TI>Dispensing with instalments under ss. 78(4) and (6)</TI>
<P>56. Corporations are required to pay instalments toward their tax liability over the course of a taxation year. These two subsections allow corporations with less than $2,000 in tax payable for the year to dispense with paying instalments. Instead, they may pay a single lump sum toward their tax payable.</P>
<P>57. Subsection 78(4) does not itself contain a mathematical procedure. Subsection 78(6) does provide mathematical procedures, but they are not self-contained.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>5)</N><TI>Conclusion on context</TI>
<P>58. The context gives meaning to the phrase &ldquo;for the purposes of calculating interest&rdquo;. Each of ss. 79, 82 and 83 provides part of the mathematical procedure for working out an amount of interest, but none of them, nor any of their individual subsections, can be used in isolation. This shows that s. 82(5), which provides part of this mathematical procedure, is for the purposes of calculating interest.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>THE PURPOSE OF S. 79(7)(a) DOES NOT PREVENT THE DEEMED DEFINTION OF TAX PAYABLE FROM APPLYING TO S. 82(5)</TI>
<P>59. There is nothing in the rationale behind s. 79(7) that prevents the deemed definition of tax payable from applying to any provision that is integral to the calculation of interest, including s. 82(5). The legislative history of s. 79(7) also suggests that the Legislature intended to apply the deemed definition to s. 82(5).</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1)</N><TI>The rationales behind s. 79(7)</TI>
<P>60. The purpose of s. 79(7)(a) is to disregard a loss carryback for interest, penalty and certain payment calculation purposes. The purpose of s. 79(7)(b) is to recognize the loss carryback but only at a later date, and only in certain contexts.</P>
<P>61. The combined effect of ss. 79(7)(a) and (b) is that, for the calculation of interest on the surplus or deficiency in the corporation's tax account, a loss carryback does not change tax payable for a taxation year, but from the effective interest date may reduce tax payable for that taxation year.</P>
<P>62. There is a reason that loss carrybacks are not immediately taken into account in calculating interest. The loss carrybacks arise from expenses that, from the perspective of the taxation year to which they are being applied, arise in the future. As the Federal Court has pointed out, in dealing with the federal counterpart to s. 79(7), the corporation should not be able to refuse to pay tax owing for the year in the hope or expectation that it has a loss to carry back to that year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For interest payable to the taxpayer: s. 164(5), as it currently reads. For interest payable by the taxpayer: s. 161(7), as it currently reads. <CASEREF><SOC>Connaught Laboratories Ltd v R</SOC><CITE>[1994] FCJ no 1681</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM><COURTJUR>TD</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This rationale gives meaning to both ss. 79(7)(a) and (b). The above rationale also applies to the non-recognition of loss carrybacks for the purposes of applying penalties.</P>
<P>63. But s. 79(7)(a) also stands on its own. There are situations in which s. 79(7)(b) is not relevant:
<P1>a) Under ss. 76(1) and (2), a loss carryback is not ever recognized in the computation of a penalty.</P1>
<P1>b) Paragraph 79(7)(b) has no role in the calculation of interest on the surplus or deficiency in an instalment account. The effective interest date arises <BOLD>after</BOLD> interest in the instalment account stops accruing. Interest on the instalment account is payable only during the corporation's instalment period: s. 79(4). Under s. 79(3)(c), the instalment period begins on the first day of the taxation year and ends on the day the balance of the tax payable must be paid under s. 78(2)(b) (either two or three months after the end of the taxation year). The earliest effective interest day is the day after the end of the loss year.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2)</N><TI>Subsection 79(7) evolved to apply to s. 82(5)</TI>
<P>64. The legislative history of ss. 79(7) and 82(5) suggests that the deemed definition of tax payable was intended to apply to s. 82(5). The predecessors of s. 79(7) applied only to the predecessors of s. 82(4). In 1994, a predecessor of s. 79(7) began to refer to <BOLD>all</BOLD> of s. 82.</P>
<P>65. When Ontario took over the administration of its corporate income tax regime in 1957, the Legislature introduced two predecessors to s. 79(7). One was found in s. 73(6) of the Act and dealt with interest <BOLD>allowed</BOLD> to the corporation:
<QUOTE><P>Where a corporation is entitled to deduct under section 37 in computing its taxable income for a taxation year an amount in respect of a loss sustained in the fiscal year immediately following the taxation year, hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;the loss year&rdquo;, and the amount of the tax payable for the taxation year is relevant in determining an overpayment for the purpose of computing interest under subsection 3 for any portion of a period ending on or before the last day of the loss year, the tax payable for the taxation year shall be deemed to be the amount that it would have been if the corporation were not entitled to deduct any amount under section 37 in respect of that loss.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Corporations Tax Act, 1957</EM>, SO 1957, c. 17, s. 73(6).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. The reference to subsection 3 is to s. 73(3), the provision that provided the corporation with the general interest rate.</P>
<P>67. An &ldquo;overpayment&rdquo; was defined in s. 73(5) as all amounts paid on account of tax payable for a fiscal year minus all amounts payable under the Act.</P>
<P>68. The other predecessor of s. 79(7) was found in s. 70(5). This provision dealt with interest payable by a corporation. It read as follows:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(5)</N><SSECP>Where a corporation is entitled to deduct under section 37 in computing its taxable income for a taxation year an amount in respect of a loss sustained in the fiscal year immediately following the taxation year, hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;the loss year&rdquo;, for the purpose of computing interest and penalty interest under this section on tax or a part or instalment of tax for the taxation year for any portion of the period in respect of which the interest is payable on or before the last day of the loss year, the tax payable for the taxation year shall be deemed to be the amount that it would have been if the corporation were not entitled to deduct any amount under section 37 in respect of that loss.</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>69. At the same time, the Legislature introduced the predecessor of s. 82(5), providing for an enhanced rate of interest on successful objections or appeals (paying 6% rather than 3%).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Corporations Tax Act, 1957</EM>, SO 1957, c. 17, s. 73(4).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It included this provision in s. 73(4), the same section in which the loss carryback provision for interest allowed was found.</P>
<P>70. From 1957 through the early 1990s, the CTA had provisions substantially similar to those in s. 73 of the 1957 version of the Act although the interest rates were moved out of the Act into the regulations (and although the Legislature had at one time modified the regulations to apply the general interest rate even to successful objections and appeals<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See RRO 1990, Reg. 183, s. 503 as originally enacted.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>).</P>
<P>71. In the RSO 1990 version of the CTA,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Corporations Tax Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. C.40, as it read upon enactment.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> s. 79 dealt with interest payable by a corporation and s. 82 dealt with interest allowable on overpayments. Subsection 82(5) already contained the enhanced interest rate provision.</P>
<P>72. As with the 1957 CTA, both ss. 79 and 82 contained provisions that were substantially similar to current s. 79(7). Subsection 79(7) dealt with interest payable by the corporation and s. 82(9) with interest allowable by the Minister.</P>
<P>73. Also, as with the 1957 CTA, s., 82(9) referred <BOLD>only</BOLD> to the general interest rate provision&mdash;that is, the equivalent of today's s. 82(4). Subsection 82(9) read as follows:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(9)</N><SSECP>Where a corporation is entitled to carry-back of loss deduct under subsection 111 (1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada) as made applicable by section 34 of this Act in computing its taxable income for a taxation year an amount in respect of a loss sustained in a taxation year following the taxation year, hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;the loss year&rdquo;, and the amount of the tax payable for the taxation year is relevant in determining an overpayment for the purpose of computing interest <BOLD>under subsection (4)</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In the RSO 1990 version as enacted, s. 82(4) read:

<P1>(b) the day on or before which the balance of the tax payable for the taxation year is required to be paid pursuant to clause 78 (2) (b),</P1>
and ending with the day of refunding or application aforesaid, unless the amount of the interest so calculated is less than $1, in which event no interest shall be paid or applied under this subsection.</P></QUOTE></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> for any portion of a period ending on or before the last day of the loss year, the tax payable for the taxation year shall be deemed to be the amount that it would have been if the corporation were not entitled to deduct an amount under subsection 111 (1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada) as made applicable by section 34 of this Act in respect of that loss. [Emphasis ours.]</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>74. In 1994 the Legislature amended the CTA to leave the loss carryback provision in s. 79, which still dealt almost entirely with interest payable by the corporation, to remove the loss carryback provision from s. 82, and to keep the enhanced interest rate provision in s. 82(5). It did this, by introducing new s. 79(7) which now covered <BOLD>both</BOLD> interest payable by the corporation and allowed by the Minister:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(7)</N><SSECP>For the purposes of calculating interest payable or allowed under this section or section 82 or 83 in respect of a particular taxation year, and for the purpose of determining the amount of a penalty, if any, to be assessed under subsection 76 (1),

<P>75. At the same time, the Legislature enacted s. 82(5) in more or less its current form:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(5)</N><SSECP>Where, by a decision made under section 84 or 92 or by a court, it is finally determined that the tax payable under this Act by a corporation for a taxation year is less than the amount assessed under section 80 to which the objection was made or from which the appeal was taken, and as a result of the decision there is a surplus in the corporation's tax account for a taxation year or in the corporation's instalment account for a taxation year, the interest rate prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, and not the rate prescribed for the purposes of subsection (4) or 83 (1), as the case may be, shall be used to determine the amount of interest for the purposes of those subsections, for each day that the surplus in the account is attributable to the decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Corporations Tax Amendment Act, 1994</EM>, SO 1994, c. 14, s. 40(3).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>76. This history shows that the Legislature moved from a loss carryback provision that targeted the ordinary interest provision (the counterpart to today's s. 82(4)) to one that applied to the whole of s. 82, encompassing s. 82(5), the provision on which the Appellant wants to rely.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The references to ss. 78(4) and (6) were added by SO 1996, c. 29, s. 61(4), deemed to have come into force on February 28, 1995 (per s. 65(17)). The reference to s. 76(2) was added by SO 2002, c. 22, s. 53(2).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It suggests that the Legislature intended that deemed definition of tax payable apply to s. 82(5).</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>F.</N><TI>THE APPLICATION OF S. 79(7)(a) TO S. 82(5)</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>1)</N><TI>Subsection 82(5) is for the purposes of calculating interest</TI>
<P>77. The Appellant suggests that s. 82(5) determines only entitlement to the enhanced interest rate, and is not about calculating interest. However, s. 82(5) is for the purposes of interest calculation. Since s. 82(5) is for the purposes of calculating interest, s. 79(7)(a)'s definition of tax payable applies to it and denies the Appellant the enhanced interest rate.</P>
<P>78. Interpreted in light of its text, context and purpose, s. 79(7)(a) does not require th at a particular provision contain the entire mathematical procedure for working out an amount interest before the deemed definition of tax payable will apply to it. It is enough that the provision be integral to this procedure.</P>
<P>79. In order to calculate interest under s. 82(4) where a corporation has successfully objected to or appealed from an assessment, we must look at another provision. Subsection 82(4) does not tell us the relevant interest rate that we must use, nor does it tell us the part of the surplus that we are to apply this interest rate. Subsection 82(5) gives us this missing information.</P>
<P>80. Subsection 82(5) provides integral parts of the mathematical procedure for the calculation of interest allowable on a surplus in the corporation's tax or instalment accounts, after a successful objection or appeal. It provides:
<P1>a) the principal amount&mdash;the part of the surplus to which the enhanced interest rate is applied. Not all surplus balances in a corporation's instalment and tax accounts on a given day are eligible for the enhanced interest rate. Only the portion of the surplus balance that is attributable to the decision on objection or appeal on that day is eligible for the enhanced rate;</P1>
<P1>b) the interest rate; and</P1>
<P1>c) the time when this interest rate is to be applied to the principal amount&mdash;daily.</P1></P>
<P>81. Given the role of s. 82(5), the deemed definition of tax payable in s. 79(7)(a) applies to s. 82(5).</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2)</N><TI>The purpose of s. 82(5) does not justify departing from the s. 79(7) deemed definition of tax payable</TI>
<P>82. The Appellant repeatedly suggests that the intention behind s. 82(5) is to punish the Minister for a wrong; that wrong being the denial of the non -capital loss carryback. The notion that the Minister is to be punished for a successful objection should not drive the understanding of the interaction between ss. 79(7) and 82(5).</P>
<P>83. There is no enhanced rate of interest under the Federal Act where a taxpayer is successful on an objection or appeal.</P>
<P>84. The rationale for enhanced interest is set out in the Ontario Committee on Taxation's 1967 report:
<P1>a) If the taxpayer and the government agree on the amount to be refunded, interest should be below current borrowing rates to prevent the taxpayer from using the government as a savings deposit bank, and</P1>
<P1>b) If the taxpayer is successful after a dispute over taxes with the government, it should receive interest comparable to market rates.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, Ontario Committee on Taxation, <EM>Report</EM>, vol. Ill (1967), at pp 14-15, paras 20-21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>85. In light of these comments, s. 79(7)(a) should not be interpreted to allow the Minister to be punished under s. 82(5). The purpose of s. 82(5) is not punishment.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3)</N><TI>Despite s. 79(7)(a), the Appellant does receive compensation for the use of its money</TI>
<P>86. The Appellant suggests that, if s. 79(7) applies, the Minister is allowed to hold onto an overpayment with impunity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Factum of the Appellant, para 40(a).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is not the case.</P>
<P>87. While the effect of s. 79(7)(a) is that the Appellant does not get the enhanced rate of interest for the loss carryback, the Appellant may still get interest at the general rate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In some years, though, the general interest rate was nil. See Ontario&mdash;Prescribed Interest Rates, 1&mdash;Ontario Ministry of Finance Interest Rates, as of April 1, 2019 (from v3.taxnetpro.com, accessed May 14, 2019).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>88. Here the effective interest date is June 25, 2010, the day on which the Appellant delivered its return for the 2010 Year (the loss year) to the Minister.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On that day, pursuant to s. 79(7)(b), the loss carryback was deemed a payment toward the Appellant's tax payable (before the application of the loss carryback). If on that date, the payment generated a surplus&mdash;<EM>i.e.</EM>, put simply, if the amounts paid or deemed paid by the Appellant exceeded the amounts payable by it&mdash;the Appellant would obtain interest at the general rate prescribed for s. 82(4).</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>4)</N><TI>Conclusion on purpose</TI>
<P>89. There are two policies in the CTA. One is to provide an enhanced rate of interest after a decision on an objection or appeal reduces tax payable. Another is to calculate tax payable without taking into account, or at least deferring recognition, of loss carrybacks in interest, penalty, and certain payment calculations.</P>
<P>90. The text and context of s. 79(7) have resolved any competition between these policies. Where a provision is for the purposes of calculating interest, tax payable is deemed to be tax payable without taking into account a loss carryback. Because there is no one provision in ss. 79, 82, and 83 that provides a complete mathematical procedure for calculating interest, any provision in ss. 79, 82 and 83 that is integral to the calculation of interest is also for the purposes of calculating interest. A provision integral to the calculation of interest is one that provides the principal amount on which the interest is to be calculated, the interest rate, or the time over which the interest accrues.</P>
<P>91. Subsection 82(5) is an integral provision. In applying s. 82(5), tax payable is deemed to mean tax payable without taking into account the loss carryback.</P>
<P>92. As a result, for interest calculation purposes, there was no difference between the tax payable for the 2008 Year as first reassessed by the Minister, which resulted from the denial of the loss carryback from the 2010 Year, and the tax payable by the Appellant after the decision on the objection, which resulted from reinstating the loss carryback. The enhanced interest rate in s. 82(5) does not apply.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">IV. ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>93. The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Appellant's question whether, in determining a corporation's entitlement to an enhanced refund interest rate under s. 82(5) of the CTA, tax payable must take a deduction from a loss carried back into account. That is, s. 79(7)(a)'s deemed definition of tax payable applies to s. 82(5) and tax payable is the corporation's tax payable before the application of a loss carryback.</P>
<P>94. Costs should be awarded to the Respondent.</P>
