<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE PLAINTIFFS/APPELLANTS, JAMIE CLARK, DONALD BELANGER and STEVEN WATTS</BOLD> (collectively, the &ldquo;Plaintiffs&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Appellants&rdquo;) <BOLD>APPEAL</BOLD> to the Court of Appeal from the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson dated June 13, 2017, made at Toronto, Ontario, striking the Appellants' negligence claim on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of action pursuant to Rule 21 (the &ldquo;Order&rdquo;).</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS ASK:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. That the deadline for delivering the Notice of Appeal and Certificate Respecting Evidence herein be extended to October 3, 2017 on consent;</P>
<P>2. That the Order be set aside and a new Order issue as follows:
<P1>a) <BOLD>THIS COURT ORDERS</BOLD> that the motion brought by the Attorney General of Ontario (the &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;) to dismiss the Appellants' negligence claim shall be and is hereby dismissed;</P1>
<P1>b) <BOLD>THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS</BOLD> that the remainder of the Attorney General's motion to strike shall be and is hereby dismissed;</P1>
<P1>c) <BOLD>THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS</BOLD> that the Attorney General shall pay the Appellants' costs of the motion to strike forthwith;</P1>
<P1>d) <BOLD>THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS</BOLD> that the Attorney General shall pay the Appellants' costs of the appeal forthwith; and</P1></P>
<P>3. For such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>4. The Appellants are officers with the Toronto Police Service. They commenced the underlying action, alleging negligence and misfeasance against the Attorney General, with respect to the alleged conduct of two assistant Crown Attorneys and one appellate Crown counsel, in the course of the criminal prosecution of Randy Maharaj (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maharaj&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Neil Singh (<BOLD>&ldquo;Singh&rdquo;</BOLD>), for armed robbery and forcible confinement;</P>
<P>5. The Appellants were officers in the Hold-Up Squad at the time, and conducted the investigation which led to the prosecution of the two men. The two men claimed that the Appellants assaulted them during the arrest. The allegations were patently false;</P>
<P>6. Despite the denials of the Appellants, the trial Crown Attorneys obtained a stay of the charges against Maharaj in November of 2011 as a result of those allegations;</P>
<P>7. Singh was convicted of the offences, but received a reduced sentence in June of 2012, due to the fact that the Crown conceded that he and Maharaj were assaulted at the time of their arrest by the Appellants;</P>
<P>8. Judges of the Superior Court in March and July of 2012 issued written decisions that were critical of the Appellants' conduct, specifically that they had assaulted the accused. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal overturned Singh's conviction, finding, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Appellants had &ldquo;tortured&rdquo; the accused, Singh. As a result, the Appellants' reputations have been irreparably damaged;</P>
<P>9. The Statement of Claim alleges that the trial and appeal Crowns failed to pursue and put before the Court all of the available evidence that completely contradicted any allegations of assault. The Appellants allege, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the Crowns violated a duty of care owed to them, and thus were negligent in law;</P>
<P>10. In addition to the negligence claim, the Appellants also pleaded the tort of misfeasance in a public office, alleging that the Crown attorneys engaged in deliberate and/or unlawful conduct in their capacity as public officers, and were aware that their conduct was unlawful and likely to harm the Appellants;</P>
<P>11. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Statement of Claim, on the basis that:
<P1>a) It failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action with respect to the torts of negligence and misfeasance in a public office; and</P1>
<P1>b) It was statute-barred pursuant to section 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> because it was alleged that the action was commenced more than two years after the Appellants discovered the material facts on which the claim was based;</P1></P>
<P>12. Stinson J. bifurcated the motion, and the limitations period issue was argued on October 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 2016;</P>
<P>13. On January 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision and dismissed the Attorney General's motion on the limitations issue. The Attorney General has, with the consent of the Appellants, filed a Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal that decision. It was also agreed the motion would be held in abeyance until the remainder of the motion before Stinson J. was dealt with;</P>
<P>14. The second part of the Attorney General's motion, i.e.: to strike the Appellants' claim for no reasonable cause of action with respect to the negligence and tort of misfeasance in a public office, was heard by Stinson J. on February 21<SUP>st</SUP> and 22<SUP>nd</SUP>, 2017. On June 13<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision and made the following findings:
<P1>a) Crown attorneys do not have absolute immunity from civil claims, other than claims for malicious prosecution and intentional non-disclosure;</P1>
<P1>b) Although all of the constituent elements to satisfy a cause of action exist for a police officer to sue the Crown in negligence, for policy reasons, the Court concluded that such a cause of action could not be allowed. As a result, the Appellants' claim of negligence was struck; and,</P1>
<P1>c) On the facts alleged in the Statement of Claim, the Appellants had properly pleaded the claim for the tort of misfeasance in a public office, and thus that aspect of their action was allowed to proceed;</P1></P>
<P>15. On November 29, 2016, the Court released its decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 7222</CITE></CASEREF>, which ruled on a similar motion to strike. That case considered whether Crown attorneys could be liable to police officers in negligence with respect to the provision of legal advice. In the reasons for her decision, the Honourable Justice Matheson held, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>a) It was not plain and obvious that there is no duty of care owed by Crown attorneys to the police; and,</P1>
<P1>b) The claim in negligence should not be struck at the pleadings stage for policy reasons, as a comprehensive factual record was needed to properly consider the policy ramifications of the novel claim at issue;</P1></P>
<P>16. On May 10, 2017, the Honourable Justice Marrocco granted the Defendants leave to appeal to the Divisional Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>;</P>
<P>17. In dismissing the Appellant's claim of negligence in the case at bar, the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson committed errors of law and of mixed fact and law that warrant the intervention of this Honourable Court, including:
<P1>a) Finding that the Plaintiff's negligence claim did not novel issues;</P1>
<P1>b) finding that a <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care could be negated by speculative policy concerns in the absence of a comprehensive (or indeed, <EM>any</EM>) factual record to substantiate those policy concerns;</P1>
<P1>c) striking the Plaintiffs' claim for negligence as against the Attorney General of Ontario at the pleadings stage for speculative policy reasons,
<P2>i. in the absence of a comprehensive factual record necessary to properly consider the policy ramifications of the novel claim at issue; and</P2>
<P2>ii. despite the existence of all constituent elements necessary to satisfy the underlying cause of action in negligence;</P2></P1>
<P1>d) failing to follow the persuasive reasoning and outcome of Madam Justice Matheson's November 29, 2016 decision dismissing a similar motion to strike in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, which remains good law, despite leave to appeal being granted by the Divisional Court;</P1>
<P1>e) failing to award costs payable forthwith by the Attorney General to the Police Officers; and</P1>
<P1>f) such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>18. The Order appealed from is a final Order of a Judge of the Superior Court of Justice dismissing a claim for an amount greater than $50,000, exclusive of costs;</P>
<P>19. Leave to appeal is therefore not required;</P>
<P>20. Sections 6, 19(1)(a), 19(1.2)(a), 19(1.2)(c) and 134 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43;</P>
<P>21. Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194; and</P>
<P>22. Such further and other bases of appellate jurisdiction as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. NATURE OF THIS APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiffs/Appellants, Jamie Clark, Donald Belanger and Steven Watts (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Appellants&rdquo;</BOLD>) appeal from the decision of the Honourable Justice Stinson of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 13, 2017, striking out the Appellants' claim in negligence.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. This appeal raises an important issue concerning the relationship between agents of the Crown who prosecute criminal cases and police witnesses who investigate and prepare those cases for prosecution.</P>
<P>3. For the purposes of this appeal, there is no question that the conduct of the Crown in the carriage of the prosecution of <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Maharaj</SOC></CASEREF> was negligent. That negligence led not only to a stay of proceedings being entered as a result of a fraud being perpetrated on the Court, but also to significant reputational and financial damages to the Appellant police officers. It must also be taken, as pleaded, that had various Crown agents exercised due care and attention in the manner in which they carried out their prosecution, adverse <EM>Charter</EM> findings and adverse legal conclusions that the Appellants had engaged in violent torturous activity against Singh and Maharaj would not have been made.</P>
<P>4. The Appellants' position is that, notwithstanding the significant and important degree of deference shown to prosecutors and a general immunity from civil liability, the Crown must be held accountable in negligence to the Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>5. The public policy argument for precluding a claim in negligence against the Crown in these circumstances should fail. Alternatively, and in any event, at this stage of the proceeding, there was an insufficient record to determine the public policy issue. The motions judge erred in law by making determinations of policy&mdash;which involve conclusions of mixed fact and law&mdash;in the absence of any evidence. He was therefore incorrect in his conclusion that, despite a finding of a <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care, the Appellants' claim in negligence should be struck for public policy reasons.</P>
<P>6. The Appellants request that the appeal be allowed and that the action be restored, and that the Respondent's motion to strike be dismissed in its entirety.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. FACTS</TI>
<P>7. The Appellants rely on the Statement of Claim's more comprehensive version of facts, the most essential of which are provided below.</P>
<P>8. The Appellants, Jamie Clark (<BOLD>&ldquo;Sgt. Clark&rdquo;</BOLD>), Donald Belanger (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Belanger&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Steven Watts (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Watts&rdquo;</BOLD>), (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Officers&rdquo;</BOLD>), are police officers with the Toronto Police Service. They were members of the Hold-Up Squad at the relevant time.</P>
<P>9. In February 2009, the Officers investigated a very serious robbery and forcible confinement at a commercial establishment. The perpetrators had brandished a firearm, zip-tied the victim, duct-taped his mouth and forcibly confined him while stealing approximately $389,000 of copper tubing.</P>
<P>10. On or about June 11, 2009, after a thorough investigation, the Officers formulated reasonable and probable grounds to arrest Neil Singh (<BOLD>&ldquo;Singh&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Randy Maharaj (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maharaj&rdquo;</BOLD>) and charge them with various offences in connection with the crime. Upon their arrest, both accused gave statements, which were video recorded. The accused elected to have a preliminary inquiry following which they were committed to stand trial.</P>
<P>11. For the first time, over two and a half years later<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>During a June 12, 2009 bail hearing, counsel for Maharaj said that his client had suffered injuries&mdash;bumps and scratches behind his ear&mdash;during the arrest. Counsel did not allege any assaultive conduct by the Officers during the interrogations. Nor was it alleged that there was any injury to Maharaj's rib. During the preliminary inquiry, counsel asked the police witnesses about physically assaulting the accused, and the Officers categorically denied the assault had taken place.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, at the trial in the Superior Court of Justice before Justice Thorburn, the two accused brought applications to stay proceedings based on alleged physical mistreatment at the hands of the Officers following their arrest. Maharaj alleged that he had been physically assaulted before he provided his inculpatory statement. T he nature of the assault was so vicious that he alleged he had suffered a &ldquo;cracked rib&rdquo; in the process. To attempt to buttress his claim, his counsel provided the Crown with an X-ray of Maharaj's chest taken after his arrest.</P>
<P>12. The Crown assigned to the case, Sheila Cressman (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Cressman&rdquo;</BOLD>), consulted Dr. Farley Moss (<BOLD>&ldquo;Dr. Moss&rdquo;</BOLD>) at Scarborough Centenary Hospital regarding the X-Ray. Dr. Moss confirmed the X-Ray showed a fractured rib, and said that this injury would cause excruciating pain if a person moved his upper arms or body. Dr. Moss said it was <BOLD><UNDER>possible</UNDER></BOLD> the rib injury occurred on the day of the arrest.</P>
<P>13. Dr. Moss was not provided with a copy of Maharaj's videotaped statement to assess whether or not it was consistent with someone having just had their rib broken, as Maharaj had alleged. During that videotaped statement, Maharaj is seen freely using his arms and carrying on in such a way that it was not possible he had sustained the rib injury at the time (this will be dealt with more fully below).</P>
<P>14. The Appellants have pleaded that Ms. Cressman failed to take further obvious and appropriate steps to investigate Maharaj's allegation. In particular, Ms. Cressman:
<P1>(a) never asked Dr. Moss to review the videotaped statement, in which Maharaj is seen making various movements with his arms that were incompatible with having a fresh rib injury;</P1>
<P1>(b) never asked Dr. Moss further questions regarding other potential time periods in which the injury could have occurred;</P1>
<P1>(c) never made inquiries of staff at Maplehurst Detention Centre (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maplehurst&rdquo;</BOLD>), where Maharaj was incarcerated during his trial, about Maharaj, even though she was in possession of Maharaj's medical records from the facility that showed no complaints about a rib injury any time after his arrest;</P1>
<P1>(d) did not properly review the transcripts of the bail hearing to understand the inconsistent injuries reported then as opposed to those reported at the time of the stay application; and</P1>
<P1>(e) did not seek further advice or comment from the Officers who had testified at the preliminary hearing and adamantly denied assaulting Maharaj.</P1></P>
<P>15. Despite her failure to take any steps to properly investigate the unsubstantiated allegation, Ms. Cressman, in consultation with senior Crown Attorney Frank Armstrong (<BOLD>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong&rdquo;</BOLD>), decided that Maharaj's statement would not be admissible because of involuntariness and therefore there would be no case against him. Mr. Armstrong did not direct Ms. Cressman or anyone else to conduct a farther investigation into the allegation. The Crown decided to stay the charges against Maharaj on November 22, 2011.</P>
<P>16. Singh's trial commenced on November 28, 2011. Singh also sought to stay the proceedings against him on the basis of abusive police conduct. He falsely testified that he also had been assaulted by the Officers. He relied on the purported mistreatment of Maharaj at the hands of the police to buttress his claim. On the ensuing application, Maharaj provided <EM>viva voce</EM> evidence that he had been assaulted by the Officers.</P>
<P>17. Although aware that the Officers had previously testified under oath that they did not engage in any assaultive conduct and would testify to that effect if called as witnesses, Ms. Cressman called no evidence to challenge or contradict the false testimony. Rather, she essentially accepted that the alleged assaults had occurred. She did so notwithstanding that she had assured Det. Sgt. Watt that he and the other Officers would be called as witnesses. However, after the first day of hearing, Ms. Cressman informed Det. Sgt. Watt she would not require the Officers' evidence. Though Det. Sgt. Watt expressed his concern to Ms. Cressman about how this decision would adversely affect the outcome of the case and findings that might be made against the Officers, Ms. Cressman would not change her position and the Officers were prevented from testifying.</P>
<P>18. The Officers were not parties to the proceeding involving the Respondent and Singh and, to the knowledge of the Crown, had no standing to adduce evidence or make representations to the Court. The Officers relied on the Respondent to ensure that findings of illegal and improper conduct were not made against them in the absence of a full and complete record. Although the Crown could not control whether a Court might make those findings, the Crown could control whether the trial Court had all information relevant to the Officers' conduct given the potential for adverse findings against the Officers.</P>
<P>19. Ms. Cressman did not require Singh's counsel to prove the nature of the alleged assault, nor did she test the evidence in any way. She simply conceded that the assaultive conduct, as falsely alleged, had occurred and that there had been a serious <EM>Charter</EM> violation. Ms. Cressman knew at the time that doing so would have serious repercussions not only for the case she was prosecuting but for the Officers as well.</P>
<P>20. In the face of the Crown's factual and legal concessions, Justice Thorburn concluded that the conduct alleged by Maharaj and Singh had occurred as they alleged. Essentially, it was the Court's view that in the absence of any competing evidence, the only conclusion available was to accept the evidence of Maharaj and Singh, which the Court did in a judgement released on March 28, 2012.</P>
<P>21. However, Thorburn J. did not stay the proceedings. Singh was subsequently convicted by a jury of armed robbery and forceful confinement. Though Justice Thorburn dismissed Singh's stay application, she reduced Singh's sentence because of the Officers' &ldquo;brutality&rdquo; and &ldquo;thoroughly reprehensible&rdquo; behaviour in the case. The Court's findings were widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet. Singh appealed the decision of Thorburn J. refusing to stay the proceedings to this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>22. Following the judgment, the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal notified the Chief of Police of their concerns about the Officers' conduct. The Special Investigations Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;SIU&rdquo;</BOLD>) invoked its mandate to conduct an investigation. However, Maharaj refused to be interviewed or to participate in the investigation, and the SIU withdrew its mandate in July 2012.</P>
<P>23. After the SIU withdrew its mandate, the Toronto Police Service Professional Standards Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;TPSPS&rdquo;</BOLD>) conducted a comprehensive and independent review of the allegations of misconduct against the Officers. The investigators concluded that, based on an analysis of all the evidence, the allegations that the Officers used excessive force could not be substantiated.</P>
<P>24. In and around November 2012, the Crown Law Office was made aware of these new material facts that demonstrated the serious injustice that had been done to the Officers. The Crown took no action in response.</P>
<P>25. Before Singh's appeal was argued, Det. Sgt. Watt met with Amy Alyea (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Alyea&rdquo;</BOLD>), who was going to argue the appeal on behalf of the Crown. He told Ms. Alyea that an egregious mistake had occurred. He advised Ms. Alyea of the results of the TPSPS report, of which she had a copy, and of Ms. Cressman's conduct. He asked Ms. Alyea to correct the injustice that had occurred in the lower court in whatever manner was appropriate.</P>
<P>26. Despite Det. Sgt. Watt's efforts, Ms. Alyea: (i) took no steps to investigate further, (ii) took no steps to rectify and repair the damage that had been done to the Officers' reputations, and (iii) took no steps to prepare and file an application to introduce fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal. During oral arguments in the appeal, the Court asked several questions about the Officers' behaviour, but Ms. Alyea never adequately advised the Court of the new material facts the Crown had learned or of the TPSPS's exculpatory findings regarding the Officers' conduct. Any attempt made by Ms. Alyea to alert the Court to the TPSPS findings or the substance of the report fell far below what was required in the circumstances. The report was not properly be fore the Court nor had it been properly disclosed to counsel for Mr. Singh.</P>
<P>27. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal released its judgment, in which it granted the appellant's stay application. The Court condemned the &ldquo;egregious nature of the police misconduct,&rdquo; which it equated with &ldquo;torture.&rdquo; It found that the alleged abusive interrogation techniques were &ldquo;calculated, prolonged and skilfully choreographed.&rdquo; The Court stated that Crown counsel was unable to provide any details of the results of the TPSPS investigation. The Court adverted several times to the fact that the Defence's allegations were uncontradicted or uncontested by the Crown. The Court found the case for a stay more compelling because the allegations of &ldquo;serious criminal conduct&rdquo; by the police had gone unchallenged.</P>
<P>28. The Court of Appeal's judgment was also widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet. Articles about the case repeated Singh's and Maharaj's false and defamatory allegations, and condemned the Officers' behaviour.</P>
<P>29. Following the Court of Appeal judgment, the SIU re-opened their investigation. Maharaj agreed to be interviewed. The investigators reviewed all of the records and obtained opinion evidence. That investigation concluded that Maharaj's rib injury post-dated the time of arrest, and that his physical demeanour in the videotaped statement was inconsistent with his having sustained any rib injury at the time of arrest (during his video-recorded interview Maharaj is moving about in a way that would not have been possible had he suffered the cracked rib injury he alleged he had suffered at the hands of the Officers). The SIU found that the allegations by Maharaj were not substantiated.</P>
<P>30. Also following the Court of Appeal judgment, the Chief of the Toronto Police Service asked the Ontario Provincial Police (<BOLD>&ldquo;OPP&rdquo;</BOLD>) to conduct an independent review of the TPSPS investigation. The OPP review was conducted by an experienced, high-ranking investigator. On April 9, 2015, the OPP investigator concluded the TPSPS review had been thorough and she had no reason to refute its conclusions that the allegations of police misconduct were unsubstantiated.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Appellants Commence an Action Against the Attorney General of Ontario</EM></TI>
<P>31. As alleged in the Appellants' Statement of Claim, several months after the Court of Appeal released its judgment, the Officers retained counsel. Counsel had the opportunity to review the entire record and listen to the audio of the oral arguments that were made in the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>32. After due consideration, counsel formed a legal opinion that they communicated to the Officers: the conduct of the Respondent may be tortious, and a novel claim in negligence and misfeasance in a public office could be pursued. It was only at this point that the Officers discovered that there was a viable claim, albeit a novel one.</P>
<P>33. The Appellants issued their Claim on June 22, 2016. In it, they claim as against the Attorney General damages for negligence and misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>34. In particular, the Claim alleges that Crown Attorneys owe a duty of care to investigating police officers and that this duty was breached through the conduct of Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea, and their superiors. The Claim also alleges that Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea and their superiors engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct that they knew to be inconsistent with their professional obligations, and that they did so in bad faith, with the knowledge that this misconduct would likely injure the Officers.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Attorney General's Motion to Strike</EM></TI>
<P>35. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 on the basis that:
<P1>(a) The action is statute-barred because the limitation period has expired: the Plaintiffs failed to commence it within two years of discovering the material facts on which the Claim is based. In particular, the Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Cressman by at least July 2012. The Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Alyea by at least December 12, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(b) The claims in negligence and misfeasance are not tenable at law. As Crown Attorneys do not owe a duty of care to investigating police officers, it is plain and obvious that the claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action in negligence and has no reasonable prospect of success. As the Attorney General states in its factum, &ldquo;[Aside from malicious prosecution,] no other action in tort is available against a Crown Attorney&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The claim in misfeasance is frivolous and vexations, as it did not provide full particulars to support this cause of action.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Decisions of the Motions Judge</EM></TI>
<P>36. Stinson J. bifurcated the motion, and heard arguments on the limitation issue first. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike on the basis of the limitation period argument by finding, <EM>inter alia</EM>: due to the legal and factual complexities of the case, it was not plain and obvious that the limitation issue would be decided against the Plaintiffs and the issue should only be determined after a complete factual context is placed before the Court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 43</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD><UNDER>Appellants' Book of Authorities</UNDER> (&ldquo;<UNDER>BOA</UNDER>&rdquo;). Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. <UNDER>The Respondent has been granted leave to appeal Stinson J.'s decision on the limitation period issue, and that appeal has now been joined with this appeal on the negligence issue.</UNDER></P>
<P>38. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision on the second part of the Attorney General's motion, i.e. to strike the Appellants' claim for no reasonable cause of action with respect to the claims of negligence and misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>39. In regard to both claims, Stinson J. held that it was not plain and obvious that Crown Attorneys have absolute immunity from civil claims, other than claims for malicious prosecution and intentional non-disclosure of exculpatory evidence. He therefore declined to strike the Officers' Claim on the basis of common-law Crown Attorney immunity.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 3683</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Clark</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 77, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. In regard to the claim of misfeasance, Stinson J. held that the Appellants had pleaded the essential elements of the tort, and that a determination of whether the Crown Attorneys acted within the scope of their duties and did not breach any legal obligations is a matter properly determined at trial. He therefore declined to strike the claim of misfeasance.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras. 149-150, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. <UNDER>The Attorney General has been granted leave to appeal Stinson J.'s decision in regard to misfeasance, and that appeal has now been joined with this appeal on the negligence issue.</UNDER></P>
<P>42. In regard to the claim in negligence, Stinson J. conducted an analysis for recognizing a new private-law duty of care according to the test set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</SOC></CASEREF> and followed by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Cooper v. Hobart</SOC></CASEREF>. He found that a relationship of proximity could arise from the fact that significant interests of the Plaintiffs are engaged when they are subject to misconduct allegations on <EM>Charter</EM> motions that only Crown Attorneys are in a position to defend against. Stinson J. therefore held that it is not plain and obvious that there is no <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care owed by trial Crown Attorneys to police officers to take reasonable care in the course of investigating and defending <EM>Charter</EM> motions alleging serious misconduct by police officers.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 104, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. At the second stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> test, Stinson J. considered whether there were any policy concerns that would negate the <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care, and made the following findings:
<P1>(a) There is no absolute requirement for an evidentiary record to assess competing policy arguments;</P1>
<P1>(b) Recognizing a duty of care in these circumstances <UNDER>would</UNDER> interfere with Crown Attorneys' ability to do their jobs by diverting them from their basic and primary responsibilities;</P1>
<P1>(c) It would alter what should be a cooperative relationship between the police and Crown Attorneys to a <UNDER>potentially</UNDER> adversarial one;</P1>
<P1>(d) It would carry the <UNDER>risk</UNDER> of increased time spent litigating criminal cases for non-core reasons; and</P1>
<P1>(e) There are alternative and more proper forums for determination of allegations of police misconduct, including police complaints processes, police disciplinary tribunals and civil actions.</P1></P>
<P>44. On the basis of these findings, Stinson J. concluded that there were important policy reasons to negate the <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care Crown Attorneys owe to investigating police officers.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras. 29, 113, 134&ndash;137, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. <UNDER>On February 21, 2018, the Divisional Court issued its decision on appeal in the parallel case,</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Attorney General of Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> <UNDER>(the &ldquo;<EM>Smith Appeal</EM>&rdquo;). The Court in that case held that common-law prosecutorial immunity shielded Crown Attorneys from civil liability for simple negligence in the provision of legal advice to police officers. The Appellants in the case at bar address the Court's decision in the <EM>Smith Appeal</EM> and its relevance to this case below.</UNDER></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">III. ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>46. The sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether Stinson J. made errors of law and/or mixed fact and law in striking the Appellants' claim in negligence.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Motions Judge Erred by Ruling Without an Evidentiary Record</EM></TI>
<P>47. The Supreme Court has stated that the test applicable to a motion to strike is that,
<QUOTE><P>[I]t is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 17, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>48. A motion to strike is designed to weed out claims that are &ldquo;hopeless,&rdquo; &ldquo;certain to fail,&rdquo; or &ldquo;could not possibly succeed.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM> at para. 19;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Paton Estate v. Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 458</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Paton Estate</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 2 and 48;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Addison Chevrolet Buick GMC Ltd. v. General Motors of Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 324</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 3, 4 and 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>49. The motion to strike is a tool that must be used with care. This is especially the case where the Court considers novel claims. In these cases, courts must be generous and err on the side of permitting the novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM> at para. 21; <EM>Paton Estate</EM> at paras. 11-12, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 3 and 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. When claimants assert a novel duty of care in negligence claims, any policy concerns that might negate or limit that duty of care must be adequately demonstrated. As the Supreme Court has stated, &ldquo;policy concerns raised against imposing a duty of care <UNDER>must be more than speculative; a real potential for negative consequences must be apparent.</UNDER>&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 41</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Hill</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 48;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Fullowka v. Pinkerton's of Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2010 SCC 5</CITE><PARANUM>57</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Fullowka</EM>&rdquo;) (emphasis added), <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 6 and 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>51. For that reason, this Honourable Court has repeatedly emphasized that courts should not strike claims on the basis of policy considerations without an evidentiary record. Again, this is especially the case where a novel claim is asserted. With out an evidentiary record, a court cannot analyze the strengths and weaknesses of competing policy arguments, and cannot confidently make judgments about legal and policy issues raised by the parties. To attempt to apply policy considerations without the benefit of a factual record is contrary to the principles on which case law has been understood to develop.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haskett v. Equifax Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2003] O.J. No. 771</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Haskett</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 52; <EM>Paton Estate</EM> at paras. 35-36 and 48;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Anger v.

<P>52. Stinson J. noted that courts have conducted evaluations of policy arguments without an evidentiary record in the context of claims against Crown Attorneys, citing the cases of <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario, Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF> as instances where the Supreme Court has engaged in this analysis. He concluded that, &ldquo;an evidentiary record is not necessarily a prerequisite to evaluating policy considerations relevant to imposing liability.&rdquo; He further held that, since courts deal with the conduct of and relationships between Crown Attorneys and police on a daily basis, they are better equipped to assess policy issues involving these justice system participants than in other, unusual contexts. He therefore engaged in an analysis of policy considerations in the case at bar without the benefit of any evidence and even without a statement of defence having been filed.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 133, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>53. With respect, all of the cases Stinson J. cited are distinguishable from the case at bar. All of these cases involved accused persons in criminal proceedings bringing claims against prosecutors. None of them involved the relationship between Crown Attorneys and investigating police officers and a possible duty of care owed by Crown Attorneys to those police. For that reason, as will be further detailed below, the policy considerations applying to the duty of care in the case at bar are different from those in the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM>. It was inappropriate and purely speculative for Stinson J. to &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; policy concerns from the context of claims by accused persons to the present context.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bridgmount Development v. Tarion Warranty Corp.</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 6190</CITE><PARANUM>32-33</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. Moreover, the fact that courts deal with justice system participants such as Crown Attorneys and investigating police on a daily basis does not obviate the need for evidence to assess policy arguments. It is the nature of the claim, and not the frequency with which certain litigants appear before courts, that dictates the need for a factual record to understand competing policy considerations.</P>
<P>55. It is undeniable that the case at bar involves a novel claim&mdash;asserting a new kind of right and a new duty of care&mdash;and unusual circumstances. As Mathieson J. correctly noted in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The Crown successfully sought leave to appeal this decision to the Divisional Court (<CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 2854</CITE></CASEREF>). <UNDER>The Divisional Court issued its decision, 2018 ONSC 993, on February 21, 2018. The Appellants address the Divisional Court's decision below.</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Certainly, aspects of the relationship between these two parts of the criminal justice system have previously been considered, but not sufficiently to strike out this claim at the pleadings stage.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 7222</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Smith</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 11, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. In considering whether or not common-law immunity would bar a crossclaim by police against Crown Attorneys for the negligent provision of legal advice, Mathieson J. remarked on the inapplicability of the cases Stinson J. mentions (i.e. the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM>) to the context of relations between Crown Attorneys and police:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>The extensive body of law about common law immunity simply does not focus on lawsuits by the police against Crown Attorneys. The <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy and related cases all have, as a common starting point, a member of the public aggrieved by the impact of the justice system upon him or her who wishes to claim relief outside the criminal justice system.</UNDER> <EM>Proulx</EM> spoke of the individuals &ldquo;caught up in the justice system&rdquo;: at para. 4. <EM>Miazga</EM> spoke of the &ldquo;victims of a clear miscarriage of justice&rdquo;: at para. 2. This forms part of the analysis in each of the key cases. In <EM>Nelles</EM>, Lamer J. had regard, in his analysis, for the victim of the alleged malicious prosecution who wished to bring a civil claim: at para. 50. The rationale based on <CASEREF><SOC>Roncarelli v. Duplessis</SOC></CASEREF> employed by McIntyre J. in <EM>Nelles</EM> and emphasized by Charron J. in <EM>Miazga</EM> is also fundamentally focused on responsibilities to members of the public.</P>
<P>As recently confirmed by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Hinse v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>... the high threshold in the <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy flows from the &ldquo;choice made to preserve a balance between the right of individual citizens to be free from groundless criminal prosecutions and the public interest in the effective and uninhibited prosecution of criminal wrongdoing&rdquo;... <UNDER>The focus of these cases is the rights of individual citizens, not the rights of police</UNDER>.</P>
<P>Thus, the common law immunity grounded in the trilogy and related cases has been recognized <UNDER>only within the context of civil claims by members of the public. I am not prepared, at this preliminary stage, to divorce common law immunity from that context</UNDER>...</P></QUOTE>

<P>57. In contrast to Stinson J., Mathieson J. decided not to import the policy concerns from those cases to analyze potential policy issues in the context of the relationship between Crown Attorneys and police, which, she noted, is &ldquo;sophisticated, complex and of critical importance to the justice system.&rdquo; Mathieson J. correctly observed that &ldquo;a more comprehensive factual record is needed to properly consider this novel claim,&rdquo; and held that it was not plain and obvious that the claim should be struck in the absence of such a record.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Smith</EM> at paras. 170&ndash;173, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. Stinson J. said that the common elements to cases where courts found an evidentiary record was required to evaluate policy arguments were, &ldquo;the factual relationship underlying the alleged duty of care was specific and unusual,&rdquo; and there was a &ldquo;novel situation and relationship.&rdquo; The case at bar meets all of these criteria. Aside from <EM>Smith</EM>, there are no reported cases of investigating police officers claiming a duty of care from Crown Attorneys. The facts of the case at bar are unusual and the claim is novel. The policy concerns applying to the relationship between the parties has not been properly assessed with a comprehensive evidentiary record.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 121; see</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Vogler v. Lemieux</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 825</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 2 and 13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>59. In the absence of an evidentiary record, Stinson J.'s policy analysis was purely speculative. His Honour's importation of a policy analysis from another context to the case at bar was unfair to the Appellants. No &ldquo;real potential for negative consequences&rdquo; was demonstrated in the context of the Appellants' Claim. For these reasons, Stinson J. erred in law by striking the Appellants' claim in negligence at the second stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> test.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Motions Judge's Speculative Policy Analysis Was Incorrect</EM></TI>
<P>60. Stinson J.'s speculative policy analysis, importing concerns from the context of the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM> without an evidentiary record and applying them to a novel claim, was incorrect. Stinson J. erred in law by making conclusions on policy considerations that were findings of mixed fact and law, in the absence a factual basis.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(a)</N><TI>There is No Concern of Indeterminate Liability</TI>
<P>61. Stinson J. predicted that &ldquo;the type of liability the officers are asking the court to impose would create a whole new class of potential claimants.&rdquo; This concern seems to echo the policy consideration of indeterminate liability or the potential for &ldquo;an avalanche of interlocutory civil proceedings and civil trials&rdquo; if courts were to recognize the novel duty of care that is proposed. This concern is not warranted in the circumstances here.</P>
<P>62. The class of potential claimants is clearly circumscribed: it is limited to investigating police officers on a particular case. As an accused could only allege the kind of misconduct at issue against these particular officers, it is to them alone that Crown prosecutors assume a duty to manage the risks of potential reputational harm. Since the class of persons to whom the duty would be owed would be within the knowledge and control of the Crown Attorneys, concerns of indeterminate liability do not arise.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Haskett</EM> at para. 45; <EM>Rausch</EM> at para. 81; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 8 and 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. As the absence of any reported cases demonstrates, it is also rare that an accused alleges the type of serious misconduct that led to the harm in the case at bar. Finally, the class of potential claimants would be limited by the requirement of establishing compensable injury caused by prosecutors' negligence in performing their duties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Further concerns about potentially overbroad liability could be addressed through the formulation of the standard of care for the reasonably prudent prosecutor. See <EM>Rausch</EM> at paras. 23 and 80; <EM>Fullowka</EM> at para. 73; and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 24</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Henry</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 88. As presented below, Crown Attorneys have duties not only to cause further investigation of allegations of serious police misconduct when it impinges on the prosecution of a case, but also <UNDER>to present</UNDER> all relevant evidence that is necessary to the narrative to the trier of fact in order to effectively prosecute a case. What is required from a prosecutor to meet the standard of care for the proposed duty in this case would parallel the requirement from <EM>Henry</EM>: the Crown would be liable if it failed to properly investigate and present information that would exculpate investigating officers from allegations of serious misconduct. The evidentiary burden for such liability could also parallel that set out by the Court in <EM>Henry</EM>: i.e. the claimant would have to prove that prosecutors were actually in possession of the information and failed to put it before the Court, or that the prosecutors were put on notice of the existence of the information and failed to obtain it. (See <EM>Henry</EM> at paras. 31 and 86). In the case at bar, the prosecutors were in possession of the information and were put on notice of the Crown Attorneys' mistakes, but failed to present the evidence to the Court.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI>Recognizing a Duty of Care Would Not Divert Crown Attorneys from Their Primary Duties</TI>
<P>64. Stinson J. reasoned that recognizing a duty of care in the circumstances of this case would divert prosecutors from their primary duties of assessing whether there are reasonable and probable grounds to prosecute a case, deciding whether it is in the public interest to do so, and protecting and respecting the rights of the accused. It would also add extraneous concerns of protecting police officers' reputations to the Crown Attorneys' reasons for litigating cases and would cause &ldquo;conflict and disruption&rdquo; in the relationship between prosecutors and police.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras 134-135, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>65. First, without the benefit of a full evidentiary record for this novel claim, it is not clear how Stinson J. was able to assess the risk or potential for the conflict of duties he warns about. The concerns he lists seem to be lifted from the context of cases like <EM>Henry</EM> and <CASEREF><SOC>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D.</SOC></CASEREF>, and the malicious prosecution trilogy. But, in those cases there was an <UNDER>inherently adversarial</UNDER> relationship between the parties: in <EM>Henry</EM> and the trilogy, the relationship was between prosecutors and accused persons; in <EM>Syl Apps</EM>, the relationship was between Children's Aid Societies and the parents of children who had been removed from their homes. By contrast, the relationship between Crown Attorneys and investigating police is complimentary: while they perform separate functions, they are both key players in the administration of justice and must cooperate and rely on each other.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D.</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 38</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 15.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. Second, the kind of prosecutorial negligence at issue in this case does not relate to the exercise of &ldquo;core&rdquo; prosecutorial discretion&mdash;&ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; decisions such as whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased; whether it is in the public interest to prosecute a case; and protecting or respecting the rights of the accused. It also does not relate to routine tactical decisions at trial. The Plaintiffs allege that Crown Attorneys negligently failed to carry out their statutory duties: they failed to investigate and challenge allegations of egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations, and they failed to put before the Court all relevant facts, thereby undercutting the effective prosecution of a crime. The Crown Attorneys knew, or should have known, that these failures would cause the Plaintiffs serious harm <UNDER>and</UNDER> would undermine the search for truth and the administration of justice.

<P>67. Third, rather than diverting Crown Attorneys from their duties, recognizing the proposed duty of care to investigating police officers and agencies would <UNDER>harmonize</UNDER> with and buttress Crown Attorneys' duties. This is illustrated by attending to Crown Attorneys' duties and to the relationship between Crown Attorneys and investigating police.</P>
<P>68. As the Appellants pointed out to the motions judge,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Stinson J. adverted to this argument in his decision at <EM>Clark</EM>, para. 111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the relevant statutes, Crown policies and case law set out the duties of Crown Attorneys in the prosecution of a case. These include:
<P1>(a) <UNDER>The duty to cause charges to be further investigated, and additional evidence to be collected</UNDER>, and further information that is likely to shed light on what did or did not happen to be provided, with the assistance of police, <UNDER>so that prosecutions may not fail for want of proof</UNDER>;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>This duty on Crown Attorneys parallels police officers' duty of reinvestigation when new information emerges in a case. As the Supreme Court said in <EM>Hill</EM>, &ldquo;Reasonable prudence may require [the police] to re-examine their prior theories of the case, to test the credibility of new evidence and to engage in further investigation provoked by the new evidence&rdquo; (<EM>Hill</EM> at para. 84).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) <UNDER>To see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented before the court</UNDER> for a determination on the merits, and that this is done fairly, but also firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength;</P1>
<P1>(c) To be firm while being fair in prosecuting the accused <UNDER>so that the Court will not be duped by defences which are not thoroughly examined</UNDER> in Court. While the criminal law leaves to the Crown Attorney many discretions as to whom and what to prosecute, and the conduct of the Crown's case, it &ldquo;does not equate a good and fair Crown Attorney with a weak lawyer&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(d) <UNDER>To call all material witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative</UNDER> of events on which the Crown's case is based, so that the elements of the offence are properly proved and <UNDER>the Crown does not risk losing its case or obtaining an unreasonable verdict that is vulnerable on appeal;</UNDER><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>As the Alberta Court of Appeal said in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. L.L.</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 222</CITE></CASEREF>, the Crown's duty to lay before the jury all material facts includes calling important, but possibly unreliable witnesses to rebut the strong testimony of the opposing party. The prosecution is not required to &ldquo;throw in the towel&rdquo; when it encounters such obstacles (paras. 14-15), <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(e) <UNDER>To see to it that every material point is made which supports the prosecution's case or destroys the case put forward for the defence</UNDER>. The prosecutor must present the case against the prisoner relentlessly, but with scrupulous fairness.</P1>

<P>69. As in <EM>Hill, Rausch</EM> and <EM>Williams</EM>, imposing a duty of care on prosecutors to investigating officers would <UNDER>complement</UNDER>&mdash;not conflict with&mdash;prosecutors' statutory duties to the general public and would have positive policy ramifications. The duty of care to investigating officers is <UNDER>pursuant</UNDER> to prosecutors' duties to the public: to effectively prosecute crime, to cause new charges or allegations to be thoroughly investigated, and to ensure all relevant evidence is put before the court in support of a conviction. Obligating prosecutors to investigate allegations of serious police misconduct, and to challenge those allegations in court, <UNDER>enhances</UNDER> the Crown's ability to prosecute a case and uphold the proper administration of justice. Investigating officers <UNDER>share</UNDER> the public's interest in seeing Crown prosecutors reasonably and diligently perform their functions, including investigating allegations thoroughly, presenting all relevant evidence, and advocating forcefully.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Hill</EM> at paras. 36, 41&ndash;43; <EM>Rausch</EM> at paras. 67&ndash;71; <EM>Williams</EM> at paras. 67 and 69; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 6, 10, 14.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>70. The proposed duty of care in this case is co-extensive with Crown Attorneys' duties pursuant to statute, case law and their own policy manual. To require Crown Attorneys to exercise due care towards investigating police officers in the face of allegations of egregious misconduct is to require them to abide by their own policies. As this Honourable Court has said, where the complaint is that the Respondent failed to follow its own policies, the Respondent cannot claim that following its own policies would &ldquo;pose a real potential for negative policy consequences.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Heaslip Estate v. Mansfield Ski Club Inc.</SOC><CITE>96 O.R. (3d) 401</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para. 28; <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, s. 11(a) and (b); Crown Policy Manual, &ldquo;Police: Relationship with Crown Counsel&rdquo;; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 24 and 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>71. In <EM>Smith</EM>, Mathieson J. was alive to this complimentary relationship between the duties of Crown Attorneys and the proposed duty of care regarding the provision of legal advice:
<QUOTE><P>[H]ow would the availability of a tort claim for negligent legal advice interfere with the relationship between these two important parts of the criminal justice system? Why is it inconsistent with independence? The provision of competent independent legal advice to the police would, it seems to me, serve the administration of justice. How would legal responsibility for negligent advice interfere?</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Smith</EM> at para. 169, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>72. Because there was no evidentiary record substantiating the policy argument that the recognition of the proposed duty of care would have a chilling effect on Crown Attorneys and would undermine the administration of justice, Mathieson J. refused to strike the claim. By contrast, Stinson J. struck the Appellants' negligence claim on the basis of purely speculative policy arguments that run contrary to Crown Attorneys' recognized duties.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Smith</EM> at paras. 172-173, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. While Stinson J.'s policy concerns were purely speculative, the facts underlying this action vividly demonstrate the <UNDER>actual</UNDER> consequences of prosecutorial negligence. The Crown Attorneys' failure to thoroughly investigate the false and unsubstantiated allegations of egregious misconduct, and failure to adduce available evidence to challenge the allegations, resulted in irreparable harm to the Officers' reputations. It also tarnished the reputation of the police force. The charges against Maharaj were stayed. The conviction of Singh was overturned. The administration of justice was brought into disrepute. Had the Crown Attorneys exercised due car e to the Officers in their investigations and prosecution, it would have increased the probability that the guilty were convicted and the convictions affirmed. The administration of justice would have been served, and the unfortunate results of this prosecution could have been avoided.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Hill</EM> at para. 43, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI>Recognizing a Duty of Care Would Not Alter the Relationship Between Crown Attorneys and Investigative Police</TI>
<P>74. Stinson J. was incorrect in his speculation that recognizing a duty of care &ldquo;would alter what should be a co-operative relationship between the police and Crown Attorneys into a potentially adversarial one.&rdquo; The case at bar illustrates the converse: it is the negligence of Crown Attorneys and the failure to recognize a duty of care to investigating police that has altered the co operative relationship to an adversarial one.</P>
<P>75. There is a special relationship&mdash;one of proximity&mdash;between Crown Attorneys and investigating police officers. Case law, Crown policy manuals and independent reports recognize that, while the roles of the Crown and the police are separate and distinct&mdash;with the police primarily in an investigative role, and the Crown in a prosecutorial role&mdash;the two must be able to work together closely and rely on each other in order to enforce criminal laws effectively. The close cooperation and collaboration between the two is essential for the effective administration of justice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. McNeil</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 3</CITE><PARANUM>22-23</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Regan</SOC><CITE>[2002] S.C.J.

<P>76. If Crown Attorneys fail to investigate and challenge evidence that investigating police intentionally committed egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations, the relationship of trust and mutual reliance between these players in the justice system will be broken. Police officers may be reluctant to collaborate with Crown Attorneys who do not fulfil their roles and whom they do not trust.</P>
<P>77. In any event, it is not clear precisely what the repercussions of failing to recognize a duty of care owed by Crown Attorneys to investigating officers would be, as there is no factual record. It was inappropriate for Stinson J. to speculate on the effects such a duty would have on the relationship between the parties. As Mathieson J. remarked on the subject of this relationship in <EM>Smith</EM>,
<QUOTE><P>[I]t has become apparent to me that a more comprehensive factual record is needed to properly consider this novel claim. Much of what was discussed in the <EM>Cooper-Anns</EM> analysis in <CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</SOC></CASEREF> arose from a full record. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Regan</SOC></CASEREF>, there was evidence from a number of witnesses about the relevant Crown practices. The facts about the relationship between the police and Crown Attorneys in cases and in these reports are not a proper basis to strike out a claim under Rule 21(1)(b) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>The submissions regarding the <EM>Cooper-Anns</EM> test have raised important issues regarding the relationship between the police and Crown Attorneys, including policy issues... A motion for summary judgment or trial is more appropriate in this case.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Smith</EM> at paras. 171-172, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>78. In addition, the reputational interests of investigating officers in the case at bar are not &ldquo;extraneous&rdquo; to the duties of Crown Attorneys. The failure of the underlying prosecution in this case resulted directly from allegations of police abuse and <EM>Charter</EM> violations that amounted to &ldquo;torture.&rdquo; It is not difficult to see how a failure to challenge such allegations will redound to undermine prosecutions and bring the administration of justice into disrepute in both the courts and the minds of the public: this Honourable Court stated as much in the underlying appeal. Crown Attorneys have analogous reputational interests in not being accused of intentionally tampering with or suppressing evidence in the manner addressed in <EM>Henry</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 750</CITE><PARANUM>44 and 46</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>; <EM>Henry</EM> at para. 69; <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 27 and 17.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>79. The reputational integrity of investigating police is essential to public confidence in the administration of justice. The failure to challenge such outrageous allegations and to impose a duty of care on Crown Attorneys would be an invitation to every accused to allege police misconduct in the hope that the prosecutors will negligently fail to investigate and challenge them.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI>Alternative Remedies Are Inadequate and Inappropriate</TI>
<P>80. Stinson J. incorrectly found that internal police complaints processes and tribunals are adequate and more proper forums for the determination of allegations of police misconduct.</P>
<P>81. Internal complaints processes cannot adequately remedy the wrong done to the Officers in this case. For one thing, the findings of an internal administrative process simply do not have the same force&mdash;either in the court system or in the minds of the public&mdash;as a pronouncement from the highest Court in the province that these Officers committed &ldquo;torture&rdquo; with &ldquo;prolonged and grave&rdquo; beatings that were in &ldquo;flagrant breach&rdquo; of the <EM>Charter</EM>.</P>
<P>82. The case at bar is a glaring example of the devaluation of administrative decisions. The Officers presented Crown Attorneys with the results of internal police investigations that exculpated them from the alleged misconduct. However, even the Crown Attorneys did not accord the results of these investigations sufficient weight to present them to the Court.</P>
<P>83. Finally, as internal police investigations and administrative procedures cannot provide remedies in damages, they are not an adequate alternative to recognizing a cause of action in negligence. To deny a remedy in tort for the damages the Officers have suffered would be to deny justice.

<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>The Divisional Court Decision in the</EM> Smith Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>84. <UNDER>The Divisional Court overturned Matheson J.'s decision in <EM>Smith</EM>. It is the Appellant's position that the case is distinguishable on the factual matrix of that case or, alternatively, the decision is wrong. In the <EM>Smith Appeal</EM>, the Divisional Court concluded that immunity from negligence for Crown prosecutors was based on two policy concerns discussed in the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM>. The Court found that the same policy concerns shielded the Crown from negligence claims when providing legal advice to police officers regarding the conduct of a police investigation.</UNDER>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Attorney General of Ontario</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 993</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Smith Appeal</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 31&ndash;33.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>The Divisional Court Decision in the</EM> Smith Appeal <EM>is Incorrect and Distinguishable</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>85. <UNDER>Neither Mathieson J. in <EM>Smith</EM> nor Stinson J. in this case found that a claim in negligence against Crown Attorneys brought by police in certain circumstances <EM>would</EM> succeed. Nor did they find that Crown Attorneys necessarily owed a duty of care to police officers. Instead, both judges found that, in the circumstances of their respective cases&mdash;which both involve <EM>novel</EM> claims&mdash;a claim in negligence was not absolutely precluded by existing case law. This was be cause prior cases that considered claims of negligence against Crown prosecutors arose in very different contexts.</UNDER></P>
<P>86. <UNDER>Contrary to the finding of the Divisional Court, there is no basis to conclude that, because Crown Attorneys may be diverted from their duties or engage in defensive lawyering if they were exposed to civil suits from accused persons, they would likewise be diverted or engage in defensive lawyering if they were liable to investigating police officers in specific situations. There was no evidence in <EM>Smith</EM> to support this conclusion. The Court did not engage in any analysis of <EM>how</EM> or <EM>why</EM> Crown Attorneys would be diverted from their duties or would engage in defensive lawyering. The Court did not explain how the potential for a conflict of duties in the context of the inherently adversarial relationship between the parties from cases like <EM>Nelles</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM> translates to the context of the relationship between police and Crown Attorneys. Instead. The Court based its conclusion, without any evidence, on the suppositions that there was a &ldquo;risk&rdquo; of diverting Crown Attorneys from their duties and exposing them to civil liability &ldquo;could&rdquo; lead to defensive lawyering.</UNDER></P>
<P>87. <UNDER>As argued above, the Court of Appeal has repeatedly stressed that courts should not strike claims&mdash;especially novel claims&mdash;on the basis of policy considerations without an evidentiary record. Similar speculative policy concerns were raised in <EM>Nelles</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM>, and yet the law evolved to encompass those novel claims. Policy determinations are conclusions of mixed fact and law. Without a factual basis, a court cannot properly analyze the strengths and weaknesses of competing policy arguments in novel contexts, and cannot confidently adjudicate the merits of a case. As there is no factual record at the pleadings stage, no &ldquo;real potential for negative consequences&rdquo; was demonstrated. The Divisional Court erred in law by basing a conclusion of mixed fact and law on law and unfounded speculation.</UNDER></P>
<P>88. <UNDER>Even if the Divisional Court in the <EM>Smith Appeal</EM> did not err in law, its conclusions are not applicable to the circumstances in the case at bar. The policy concerns underlying prosecutorial immunity do not, <EM>prima facie</EM>, militate against the police officers' claims in this case.</UNDER></P>
<P>89. <UNDER>As argued above, in this case. Crown Attorneys would not be diverted from their duties because the proposed duty of care <EM>harmonizes</EM> with and compliments their prosecutorial duties in the effective administration of justice. In other words. Crown Attorneys would be liable to officers where their breach of the duty of care is also a breach of their duties to prosecute fairly and effectively. Obligating Crown Attorneys to investigate allegations of serious police misconduct that could undermine an effective prosecution, and to challenge those allegations in court, enhances the Crown's ability to prosecute a case and accords with all of the duties ascribed to Crown Attorneys pursuant to statute, case law and Crown policy manuals. Indeed, the Court of Appeal's judgment in the underlying appeal perfectly illustrates how the Crown Attorneys' failure to take care with respect to the officers' reputations breached their prosecutorial duties. The Crown Attorneys' failure to adequately investigate and call available rebuttal evidence resulted in the charges being staved and the administration of justice being brought into disrepute.</UNDER></P>
<P>90. <UNDER>The imposition of the proposed duty of care would not have a chilling effect or cause prosecutors to act defensively. First, Crown prosecutors are indemnified from <EM>personal</EM> civil liability in the course of exercising their professional duties. This significantly reduces the prospect that their fear of civil liability will make them more defensive in prosecuting cases. Second, because the proposed duty to investigating police is co-extensive with its prosecutorial duties, as argued above, the Respondent cannot claim that following its own policies and performing its duties would &ldquo;pose a real potential for negative policy consequences.&rdquo; Third, because the proposed duty of care compliments their prosecutorial duties, the likelihood that similar situations will arise&mdash;where Crown Attorneys simply concede egregious, systemic and intentional <EM>Charter</EM> violations without doing an adequate investigation or presenting available rebuttal evidence&mdash;is extremely small. The lack of judicial precedent on this speaks to the rarity of these circumstances, and not to the supposed impregnability of prosecutorial immunity.</UNDER>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Hill</EM> at paras. 56-57, 59;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Heaslip Estate v. Mansfield Ski Club</SOC><CITE>96 O.R. (3d) 401</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>91. <UNDER>In any event, arguments about the &ldquo;risk&rdquo; of diversion from duties and the possibility of a chilling effect are purely speculative. To establish any likelihood of such consequences requires that this Claim be allowed to proceed so that an evidentiary record on these policy issues can be established. Additionally, there is no risk that prosecutors would feel compelled, for fear of a negligence claim, not to concede any <EM>Charter</EM> breach whatsoever even if it is patently obvious there was a <EM>Charter</EM> breach. The officer who engages in conduct which clearly establishes a Charter breach would have no claim against a Crown for conceding the same. The claim of negligence would only arise against the Crown who not only fails in her duties but also where it is established that, had she complied with her duties, the <EM>Charter</EM> claim would not have been conceded.</UNDER></P>
<P>92. <UNDER>Moreover, unlike the <EM>Smith Appeal</EM>, in the case at bar there is a countervailing policy consideration: the erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice. It is abundantly clear from the judgment of this Honourable Court in the underlying appeal that the alleged, uncontradicted and egregious misconduct eroded public confidence in the administration of justice:</UNDER>
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>In my opinion, this is one of those rare cases [in which the &ldquo;misconduct is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the light of it will be offensive&rdquo; because the &ldquo;exceedingly serious abuse could [bring] such continuing disrepute upon the administration of justice&rdquo;].</UNDER></P>
<P><UNDER>The conduct [alleged here] goes to the heart of the integrity of the justice system... This case calls for the imposition of a stay...</UNDER></P>
<P><UNDER>... What occurred here was the administration of a calculated, prolonged and skillfully choreographed investigative technique developed by these officers to secure evidence. This technique involved the deliberate and repeated use of intimidation, threats and violence, coupled with what can only be described as a systematic breach of the constitutional rights of detained persons...</UNDER></P>
<P><UNDER>... What took place here sullies the reputations of the many good officers in our country, whose work is integral to the safety and security of our society...</UNDER></P>
<P><UNDER>... Just as the fabrication of evidence by the police violates the integrity of the administration of justice, so too does the police misconduct in question here...</UNDER></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 750</CITE><PARANUM>39&ndash;49</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>93. <UNDER>The gravity of the alleged misconduct and its serious, negative effect on the public perception of the administration of justice and the integrity of the justice system distinguish the circumstances of this case from those in the <EM>Smith Appeal</EM>.</UNDER></P>
<P>94. <UNDER>Another characteristic that distinguishes this case from <EM>Smith</EM> is that the Appellants have alleged bad faith conduct on the part of the Attorney General in their Claim, and on this basis have also pleaded the tort of misfeasance in a public office. The Crown Attorneys' bad faith is not essential to the Appellants' negligence claim. However, an inference of bad faith can be drawn from the allegation that the Crown Attorneys acted outside the scope of their prosecutorial duties by failing to investigate the grave allegations made by the accused and to call available rebuttal evidence in both the underlying trial and appeal. Striking the negligence claim at this stage will not end the proceedings against the defendant. This also favours not striking the claim at this time.</UNDER></P>
<P>95. <UNDER>Finally, in the case at bar, the Appellants suffered serious harm <EM>personally</EM> as a result of the Crown Attorneys' misconduct. This harm included having their reputations grievously and irreparably damaged when this Honourable Court identified them personally as responsible for torture and egregious and flagrant breaches of the accused's <EM>Charter</EM> rights in the underlying appeal. The Appellants deserve some vindication and compensation for these damages, which cannot be compensated for through any alternative administrative process.</UNDER></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Conclusion</EM></TI>
<P>96. This Honourable Court has repeatedly stated that courts should not assess policy considerations that would negate or limit a novel claim in tort in the absence of a comprehensive evidentiary record. The motions judge in this case erred in law by importing policy considerations from another context to make findings of mixed fact and law without a factual basis, and then incorrectly dismissed the Appellants' claim in negligence.</P>
<P>97. Stinson J.'s policy concerns were purely speculative and are outweighed by countervailing policy concerns. The Respondent did not demonstrate a <UNDER>real potential for negative policy consequences</UNDER>.</P>
<P>98. For these reasons, it was not plain and obvious that the Appellants' claim in negligence had no reasonable prospect of success, and it should be allowed to proceed to trial.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The appellants' appeal should be dismissed. Based on the jurisprudence of this Honourable Court and that of the Supreme Court of Canada in its quartet of decisions on Crown Attorney liability, the motion judge could come to no other reasonable conclusion than to dismiss the appellants' claim in negligence.</P>
<P>2. Policy considerations negating a private law duty of care can be, and routinely are, determined on preliminary motions without a full evidentiary record, even where such claims are &ldquo;novel&rdquo;. This is particularly so with respect to the liability of Crown Attorneys, where there is a substantial body of case law considering the policy implications of imposing a private law duty of care.</P>
<P>3. In this case, it is clear that imposing a private law duty of care against Crown Attorneys to an entirely new class of claimants&mdash;investigating police officers&mdash;would insert extraneous considerations into their determinations of whether and how to proceed with a prosecution. Further, it has the potential to invite a flood of litigation from police officers dissatisfied with how a Crown Attorney proceeds with respect to charges they have laid. This would divert Crown Attorneys from their important public duties. The Supreme Court has noted that such concerns are &ldquo;very real&rdquo;, not speculative, as alleged by the appellants. These considerations outweigh the fact that the appellants would be denied the ability to collect damages if a duty of care is not imposed.</P>
<P>4. While the motion judge ultimately came to the correct, and inevitable result, it is the Attorney General's position that he did err in failing to find that the existing jurisprudence regarding Crown Attorney liability was dispositive of the issues on the motion. Further, the motion judge erred by failing to consider the conflict between the alleged private law duty of care and the public duties owed by Crown Attorneys at the proximity stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> analysis. Had he done so, based on his findings with respect to the second stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> test, he would have found that there was no proximity. The Attorney General requests that this Court exercise its error correcting function to correct these errors in the motion judge's analysis.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Response to the Appellants' Version of the Facts</TI>
<P>5. Although the appellants have not attributed the facts set out in their factum to particular paragraphs of their Statement of Claim (Claim), the Attorney General accepts that the facts do emanate from the Claim with the following exceptions:
<P1>i) The appellants did not plead that the review conducted by the Toronto Police Service Professional Standards Unit (TPSPS) was &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, as alleged in paragraph 23 of their factum. In fact, TPSPS were investigating their own officers;</P1>
<P1>ii) The allegation at paragraph 26 of the appellants' factum that &ldquo;[a]ny attempt made by Ms. Alyea to alert the Court to the TPSPS findings or the substance of the report fell far below what was required in the circumstances. The report was not properly before the Court nor had it been properly disclosed to counsel for Mr. Singh&rdquo; was not pleaded in the Claim. This allegation against Ms. Alyea in the appellants' factum appears to be a response to the finding of the motion judge that the appellants have no viable claim against Ms. Alyea because they cannot establish causation with respect to her conduct.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras. 31&ndash;33, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 6; Transcript, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, Ontario Court of Appeal, October 18, 2013, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1 at p. 65-66; Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC><PARANUM>93</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>iii) The allegation at paragraph 32 of the appellants' factum that &ldquo;[a]fter due consideration, counsel formed a legal opinion that they communicated to the Officers: the conduct of the Respondent may be tortious, and a novel claim in negligence and misfeasance in public office could be pursued. It was only at this point that the Officers discovered that there was a viable claim, albeit a novel one&rdquo; is not pleaded in the Claim. The issue of the &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; of the Claim was raised for the first time in response to the Attorney General's motion to strike based on the expiry of the applicable limitation period.</P1></P>
<P>6. With respect to paragraph 11 of the appellants' factum, it is correct that the accused did not bring an application to stay the prosecutions against them based on the involuntariness of their confessions until trial. However, as noted at footnote one of the appellants' factum and paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Claim, counsel for Mr. Maharaj noted on the record at the bail hearing that his client had visible injuries resulting from his arrest and again raised the issue of violence against Mr. Maharaj at the preliminary inquiry.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paragraph 11, Appeal Book and Compendium (Appeal Book), Tab 6</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Additional Facts on Which the Attorney General Relies</TI>
<P>7. It is correct as alleged at paragraph 19 of the appellants' factum that Ms. Cressman determined that she would not call any evidence in response to the allegations by either Mr. Singh or Mr. Maharaj and stayed the charges against Mr. Maharaj. However, she also advised the Court that the evidence demonstrated that whatever happened to Mr. Singh was not as extreme as he suggested, but that the evidence did meet the low threshold required to establish a <EM>Charter</EM> breach. She suggested the proper remedy with respect to the charges against Mr. Singh, was not a stay of proceedings, but a reduction of sentence.

<P>8. Neither the appellants nor the Toronto Police Association moved to intervene in the appeal of Justice Thorburn's decision to this Court.

<BLOCK4><N>i)</N><TI>Decision of the Motion Judge on the Negligence Issue</TI>
<P>9. The motion judge made six key findings on the negligence issue:
<P1>1) The novelty of the Claim was not dispositive of the motion;</P1>
<P1>2) That competing policy considerations could be determined on a motion to strike without an evidentiary record, particularly where the civil liability of Crown Attorneys was being considered;</P1>
<P1>3) That existing case law regarding Crown Attorney liability was not dispositive of the issues on the motion;</P1>
<P1>4) There was proximity between the police officers and the trial Crowns;</P1>
<P1>5) There is no viable claim against the appellate Crown as the facts as pleaded do not give rise to causation and no viable claim against the trial Crowns with respect to the stay of proceedings against Mr. Maharaj; and</P1>
<P1>6) A cause of action in negligence was negated by residual policy considerations.</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><N>1)</N><TI>Novelty of the Claim is not Dispositive</TI>
<P>10. The appellants argued that the Court should err on the side of allowing their action to proceed because it was novel. The motion judge rejected this argument and, relying on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco</SOC></CASEREF>, found that the novelty of a claim is &ldquo;not determinative&rdquo; on a motion to strike. A claim should not be struck for its novelty alone, but a claim does not get a &ldquo;free pass&rdquo; to proceed just because it is novel. Instead of focusing on the novelty of a claim, a Court must determine whether, assuming the facts pleaded are true, there is a reasonable prospect that the claim will succeed, reading the claim generously and erring on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 24&ndash;29</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>2)</N><TI>Policy Considerations can be Determined Without a Full Evidentiary Record</TI>
<P>11. The appellants also argued that a full evidentiary record was required to determine the policy issues raised by their Claim. The motion judge also rejected this argument, finding that while there were some cases suggesting that Courts should be reluctant to strike claims that raise competing policy considerations, &ldquo;Courts can and do consider competing policy considerations on preliminary motions&rdquo; and &ldquo;the case law indicates that there is no absolute requirement for an evidentiary record to assess competing policy arguments&rdquo;. With respect to claims against Crown Attorneys in particular, the motion judge found:
<QUOTE><P>The four Supreme Court decision [sic] I have just mentioned (<EM>Nelles, Proulx, Miazga</EM>, and <EM>Henry</EM>) all demonstrate that, in the context of claims against Crown Attorneys, an evidentiary record is not necessarily a prerequisite to evaluating policy considerations relevant to imposing liability. Courts deal with the conduct of and relationships between Crown Attorneys and the police on a day-to-day basis. As such they are far better equipped to weigh policy issues involving these justice system participants&mdash;without the need for an evidentiary record&mdash;than situations involving casino regulators, municipalities and tenants, or credit reporting agencies, [the situations in the cases relied on by the appellants]. I therefore do not consider the absence of an evidentiary record a bar to completing the final phase of the &ldquo;<EM>Anns</EM> test&rdquo; in the present case.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 28&ndash;29, 133</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>3)</N><TI>Existing Case Law on Crown Attorney Liability not Dispositive of the Issues on the Motion</TI>
<P>12. The motion judge found that the existing case law regarding Crown Attorney liability, which makes clear that there is no cause of action against a Crown Attorney in negligence <EM>vis a vis</EM> a person whom they have prosecuted, was not dispositive of the issues on the motion because the jurisprudence did not specifically consider whether there would be a cause of action in negligence against Crown Attorneys by police officers. In so doing, the motion judge relied on the decision of the Superior Court of Justice in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>In short, I have reviewed the case law and agree with Matheson J.'s observations in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><PARANUM>136</PARANUM></CASEREF> that &ldquo;[t]he extensive body of law about common law immunity simply does not focus on lawsuits by the police against Crown Attorneys&rdquo; and (at para. 138) that &ldquo;the common law immunity grounded in the trilogy and related cases has been recognized only within the context of civil claims by members of the public.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The existing case law focuses on the duties owed by Crown Attorneys to accused persons. The cases also set out broader principles that are applicable to Crown Attorney civil liability more generally. That said, for the reasons that follow, in my view it is not plain and obvious that the existing case law on Crown Attorney civil liability definitively bars <UNDER>all</UNDER> claims by <UNDER>all</UNDER> persons against Crown Attorneys other than claims by former accused persons for malicious prosecution or intentional non-disclosure. Instead, since I do not find that the existing case law is dispositive, I find it necessary to review it to identify generally applicable principles that will assist in the &ldquo;<EM>Anns</EM> test&rdquo; analysis later in these reasons.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 39-40</P1></P>
<P>13. However, while the motion judge noted that leave to appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> had been granted by the Divisional Court, he did not note that leave had been granted on the basis that there was &ldquo;good reason to doubt the correctness of the decision&rdquo;. <UNDER>In the appeal decision of the Divisional Court in <EM>Smith</EM>, released after the motion judge's decision in this case, a unanimous panel overturned the decision of the motion judge in <EM>Smith</EM>, finding errors in her reasoning and analysis. Thus, the motion judge's analysis in <EM>Smith</EM> no longer has any authoritative weight and should not inform the determination of the issues before this Court.</UNDER>

<BLOCK5><N>4)</N><TI>Crown Attorneys in a Proximate Relationship with the Appellants</TI>
<P>14. With respect to the first stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> analysis, the Attorney General conceded that it was foreseeable that a decision a Crown Attorney makes in the conduct of a prosecution may have a negative impact on an individual (i.e. a police officer, witness or complainant). However, foreseeability is not sufficient to establish a duty of care. A proximate relationship must first exist. The Attorney General argued that there was no proximate relationship between the Crown Attorneys and the appellants &ldquo;because such a relationship would be in direct conflict with the public nature of a Crown Attorney's duties, which are derived from statutes such as the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> and <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act&rdquo;</EM>. While recognizing that a duty of care can also arise based on specific interactions between a government actor and a claimant where the government actor may have made representations on which a claimant relied, the Attorney General did not deal with this issue in depth because the appellants did not plead that there were representations and reliance in their Claim. The appellants did however raise this issue in defence to the motion even though it had not been pleaded, arguing that the alleged duty of care arose from either a combination of statutory duties and specific interactions or simply specific interactions.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 101&ndash;104</P1></P>
<P>15. The motion judge found that it was not plain and obvious that the trial Crowns were not in a proximate relationship with the appellants. He found that a Crown Attorney may owe a duty to officers facing serious allegations of misconduct to take reasonable care to investigate such allegations and to adduce material evidence arising from those investigations in Court. He agreed with the Attorney General that, standing alone, the statutory duties of the Attorney General and Crown Attorneys appear to be public in nature and do not impose a private law duty of care with respect to investigating police officers, but the question before him was whether a duty of care is made out from a combination of statutory duties and specific interactions (or just specific interactions) and whether such a duty would conflict with a Crown Attorney's &ldquo;overarching duty to the public&rdquo;. Nevertheless, the motion judge did not conduct any analysis with respect to the &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; between a Crown Attorney's public duties and the alleged private law duty of care at the proximity stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> test. The duty of care cases of the Supreme Court have found that a conflict between public duties and the imposition of a private law duty of care is a compelling policy reason for refusing to find proximity.

<BLOCK5><N>5)</N><TI>No Viable Claim Against the Appellate Crown or Arising from the Withdrawal of the Charges Against Mr. Maharaj</TI>
<P>16. The motion judge found that there was no viable claim against the appellate Crown counsel because causation was not made out on the facts as pleaded. The motion judge also found there could be no liability against the trial Crowns with respect to the decision to withdraw the charge against Mr. Maharaj because the decision to withdraw or proceed with a prosecution was solely within the discretion of a Crown Attorney and there is no duty to take the interests of police into account when making that decision.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 101&ndash;104</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>6)</N><TI>Policy Considerations Negate a Duty of Care</TI>
<P>17. Despite having found that the trial Crown Attorneys were in a proximate relationship with the appellants, the motion judge found that residual policy considerations negated any duty of care. He found that the policy considerations set out in the Supreme Court quartet were applicable in this case: namely that the spectre of civil liability against Crown Attorneys could divert them from their duties by having to defend against a litany of civil claims, and could make them more defensive in their approach. If recognized, the duty of care alleged by the appellants would create a whole new class of potential claimants and Crown Attorneys would be required to consider the reputational interests of investigating police officers when making decisions about the conduct of a prosecution. The recognition of this duty of care would also divert Crown Attorneys from their basic responsibility to assess whether there are reasonable grounds to prosecute a case and to decide whether it is in the public interest to do so while protecting and respecting the rights of the accused. Finding a duty of care would impose considerations extraneous to their responsibilities as Crown Attorneys and would consequently divert them from those important functions.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at paras. 133-135</P1></P>
<P>18. Finally, the motion judge also found that there were alternative and more proper forums for the determination of allegations of police misconduct, such as the police complaints process, disciplinary proceedings or civil actions against the police where the police could fully respond to such allegations.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at para. 136</P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;RESPONSE TO THE APPELLANTS' ISSUES</TI>
<P>20. It is the Attorney General's position that the motion judge was correct in finding that policy considerations negate a duty of care in this case; was correct in finding that novelty is not determinative on a motion to strike; and was correct in determining that even though the appellants' claim in negligence was &ldquo;novel&rdquo; it should be dismissed.

<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>21. A motion judge assessing whether a statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action is engaged in a purely legal analysis and therefore the standard of review on appeal is correctness. Because the standard of review is correctness, this Court is free to replace the opinion of the motion judge with its own.

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Novelty of a Claim is Not a &ldquo;Free Pass&rdquo; on a Motion to Strike</TI>
<P>22. The motion judge was correct in determining that the novelty of a claim was not a complete answer to a motion to strike. While a claim should not be struck for its novelty alone, a claim does not get a &ldquo;free pass&rdquo; to proceed simply because it is novel. Instead of focusing on the novelty of a claim, a Court must determine whether, assuming the facts pleaded are true, there is a reasonable prospect that the claim will succeed, reading the claim generously and erring on the side of permitting a novel, but arguable claim to proceed to trial. The Court must evaluate a claim, novel or otherwise, in the context of the facts pleaded and the applicable jurisprudence. The motion judge's approach was endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco</SOC></CASEREF> and by this Court in <EM>Paton Estate</EM>.

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Evidentiary Record Not Required to Determine the Policy Issues in this Case</TI>
<P>23. The motion judge was also correct in finding that he could determine the policy issues in this case without a full evidentiary record even though the cause of action was &ldquo;novel&rdquo;.</P>
<P>24. Whether the policy considerations required to ascertain whether a duty of care exists can be determined without a full evidentiary record is decided on a case-by-case basis. The Courts hearing the cases cited by the appellants determined that a full evidentiary record was required in those cases. However, in other cases, the Supreme Court and this Court have determined no evidentiary record is required to determine whether policy considerations negate a duty of care.

<P>25. This is particularly so with respect to the civil liability of Crown Attorneys, where the Supreme Court has given extensive consideration to the policy implications of actions in negligence against Crown Attorneys on appeals arising from motions to strike. <UNDER>While the appellants argue at paragraphs 86 and 87 of their factum that the appeal decision in</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> <UNDER>is wrongly decided because there was &ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; that the policy considerations set out in <EM>Henry</EM> would be engaged if a duty of care is imposed in that case, it is clear from the Supreme Court jurisprudence that evidence is not required to determine whether or not a Crown Attorney is liable for a particular cause of action.</UNDER>

<P>26. In <CASEREF><SOC>Arora v. Whirlpool Canada LP</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court recognized that its dicta in <CASEREF><SOC>Haskett v. Equifax Canada Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, relied on by the appellants, was not a hard and fast rule which applied in every case, and &ldquo;in certain circumstances...a policy analysis can be conducted on a pleadings motion&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>It is notable that Feldman J.A., who authored the Court's decision in <EM>Haskett</EM>, was also on the panel that determined <EM>Arora</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For example, where there is no <EM>genuine</EM> legal or factual issue, a trial and complete record are not required.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Arora v. Whirlpool Canada LP</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 92</P1></P>
<P>27. Moreover, where the Court already has the benefit of a significant body of jurisprudence to assist in answering the question before the Court, an evidentiary record is less likely to be required. Given the significant body of case law regarding Crown Attorney liability emanating from the Supreme Court and from this Court, the motion judge and this Court are well placed to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of competing policy arguments without the need for a full evidentiary record.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Arora v. Whirlpool Canada LP</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 92</P1></P>
<P>28. In determining whether a full evidentiary record is required, it is important for the Court to consider, what, in a particular case, an evidentiary record could reasonably be expected to add to the Court's determination. In this case, the appellants repeatedly state that a full evidentiary record is required to determine the policy issues, but do not state how evidence would actually assist the Court in this determination or provide any &ldquo;meaningful indication of the nature of the policy evidence [they] would lead if the matter proceeded to trial&rdquo;. The facts pleaded, which are comprehensive and detailed when it comes to the Crown Attorneys' actions, must be taken as true and assumed to be provable&mdash;evidence establishing those facts will add nothing to the Court's determination of the policy issues. Further, there is extensive case law regarding the policy issues engaged with respect to the civil liability of Crown Attorneys. The issue on this appeal is not whether the appellants <UNDER>can</UNDER> prove their factual assertions. Instead, the <UNDER>issue</UNDER> is that even if all of their assertions are accepted as true, their claims would fail because of the risk of indeterminate liability and the resulting diversion of Crown Attorneys from their important public duties <UNDER>if a duty of care were imposed</UNDER>. An evidentiary record cannot cure this defect.

<P>29. Moreover, deciding policy issues on a motion to strike can have a beneficial effect on access to justice. As the Supreme Court held in <CASEREF><SOC>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. D. (B.)</SOC></CASEREF>, the benefit of testing the viability of a novel claim on a motion to strike is obvious: &ldquo;If there is no legally recognized duty of care... there is no legal justification for a protracted and expensive trial.&rdquo; Access to justice would not be served by forcing these parties on to an even more costly trial.

<P>30. Both <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF> dealt with &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims&mdash;in <EM>Nelles</EM>, the Supreme Court found, for the first time, that Crown Attorneys could be subject to the tort of malicious prosecution and in <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court determined, for the first time, that the state should be liable for the constitutional tort of the intentional failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to an accused person.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM></P1></P>
<P>31. The determination by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> that Crown Attorney liability should be strictly circumscribed and that Crown Attorneys should be immune from suit for any cause of action other than malicious prosecution was a matter of policy. While the Court found that individuals who were the victims of deliberate or malicious conduct by a Crown Attorney should have some recourse, the Court was careful to state that the inherent difficulty in proving an action for malicious prosecution created the appropriate balance of interests. The Court was also careful to note that an action in malicious prosecution did not involve errors in judgment, negligence or second-guessing the discretionary decisions of prosecutors. Only where malice or the deliberate misuse of the office of the Crown Attorney could be proven would liability lie. This high threshold was required to ensure Crown Attorneys were not diverted from their important duties by a flood of litigation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 48&ndash;56</P1></P>
<P>32. These policy considerations were reiterated by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF> and more recently in <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>. In <EM>Proulx</EM>, the Court affirmed the findings in <EM>Nelles</EM> and stated:
<QUOTE><P>Under our criminal justice system, prosecutors are vested with extensive discretion and decision-making authority to carry out their functions. Given the importance of this role to the administration of justice, courts should be very slow indeed to second-guess a prosecutor's judgment calls when assessing Crown liability for prosecutorial misconduct.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The Court further noted that liability would not be established if the conduct of a Crown Attorney was reckless, negligent or even grossly negligent. Liability would only lie if there was evidence of a willful and intentional effort on the Crown Attorney's part to abuse or distort its proper role within the criminal justice system.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec</SOC><CITE>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 9</CITE><PARANUM>4 and 35</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 5</P1></P>
<P>33. The Court in <EM>Miazga</EM> came to a similar conclusion, finding that only malicious conduct could lead to liability and that mistakes made because of &ldquo;inexperience, incompetence, negligence, or even gross negligence&rdquo; were not actionable.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 51</CITE><PARANUM>49, and 80-81</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 16</P1></P>
<P>34. As noted above, in <EM>Henry</EM>, the Supreme Court created a new cause of action in addition to malicious prosecution because it found that the disclosure of evidence did not come within the purview of discretionary decisions made by Crown Attorneys, but instead was a constitutional obligation. Nevertheless, the Court found that the policy concerns raised in the malicious prosecution trilogy are not confined to the malicious prosecution realm. Instead, those concerns have a broader reach and are implicated wherever there is a risk of undue interference with the ability of prosecutors to freely carry out their duties in furtherance of the administration of justice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columba</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 76</P1></P>
<P>35. The Court in <EM>Henry</EM> determined that lowering the threshold for Crown Attorney liability to a negligence standard ignored &ldquo;the basic realities of conducting a criminal prosecution&rdquo; and that &ldquo;a duty of care paradigm risks opening up a Pandora's box of potential liability theories&rdquo;. The Court noted that the problems with a negligence-based standard are even more apparent when considering how this lower threshold would operate at the pleadings stage: the lower the threshold, the greater the number of claims that would have to be defended. The mere fact of having to respond to an onslaught of litigation, even if ultimately unsuccessful, would influence the actions of prosecutors and divert them from properly performing their important public functions. It would be far too easy for a claimant with a weak claim to plead facts disclosing a cause of action for negligence&mdash;<EM>simpliciter</EM> or gross&mdash;and thus drive prosecutors into civil court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><PARANUM>43, 92-93</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>36. In summary, the Court found that imposing liability in negligence on Crown Attorneys:
<P1>i) Would undermine the ability of prosecutors to discharge their important public duties, with adverse consequences for the administration of justice;</P1>
<P1>ii) May influence the decision-making of prosecutors and make them more &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; in their approach. The public interest is not well served when Crown counsel are motivated by fear of civil liability, rather than their sworn duty to fairly and effectively prosecute crime; and,</P1>
<P1>iii) Would open up the floodgates of civil liability and force prosecutors to spend undue time and energy defending their conduct in court instead of performing their duties.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><PARANUM>40-41 and 72&ndash;74</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2></P1></P>
<P>37. Further, rather than being &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; as alleged by the appellants, the Court found these concerns to be &ldquo;very real&rdquo; and that they provided &ldquo;compelling reasons&rdquo; why the liability of Crown Attorneys in negligence should not be imposed.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>38. This Court and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice have also repeatedly determined that there is no cause of action in negligence against a Crown Attorney.

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The Motion Judge's Policy Analysis Was Correct, Not Speculative</TI>
<P>39. In determining that policy considerations negated a duty of care in this case, the motion judge relied on dicta of the Supreme Court in the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM>. He found that increasing the spectre of civil liability to negligence claims against Crown Attorneys by an entirely new class of claimants could divert Crown Attorneys from their duties by requiring them to defend against a litany of civil claims, and could make them more defensive in their approach. The motion judge found that the duty of care alleged would require Crown Attorneys to consider, in each case, whether the reputational interests of the police dictated a certain approach. It would also divert Crown Attorneys from their basic responsibilities in assessing whether there are reasonable grounds to prosecute a case and deciding whether it is in the public interest to do so while protecting and respecting the rights of the accused. Finding a duty of care would impose considerations extraneous to their responsibilities. The motion judge was correct in these findings as the Supreme Court in <EM>Henry</EM> recognized these as real and compelling concerns.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM></P1></P>
<P>40. While the appellants attempt to dismiss the substantial body of case law regarding Crown Attorney liability for negligence in one fell swoop by relying on the fact that it deals only with Crown Attorney liability <EM>vis a vis</EM> individuals they have prosecuted, and not <EM>vis a vis</EM> investigating police officers, the fact that the claimant is different does not change the policy analysis. <UNDER>Further, in the appeal decision in</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF><UNDER>, a unanimous panel of the Divisional Court found that Matheson J. was in error when she took the same approach. The Court also implicitly rejects the approach taken by the motion judge on the motion below, which it found &ldquo;essentially follows the analysis of the motion judge&rdquo; in <EM>Smith</EM>.</UNDER>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> (appeal decision), supra, at paras. 24&ndash;38</P1></P>
<P>41. The same policy considerations which upheld a Crown Attorney's immunity from suit save for claims for malicious prosecution and intentional wrongful non-disclosure apply and are, in fact, even more salient with respect to the appellants for two reasons. First, if Crown Attorneys are found to have a duty of care to investigating police officers as alleged in the Claim, they face the potential of litigation whenever a police officer is dissatisfied with the way a Crown Attorney handles a case (i.e. when a Crown Attorney determines there is no reasonable prospect of conviction and withdraws charges laid by police), or at least whenever a Crown Attorney decides he or she must concede a <EM>Charter</EM> breach by the police. Defending such claims would cause significant diversion from their duties. Secondly, such a duty of care would force a Crown Attorney to consider the possibility of civil litigation by investigating officers when making decisions with respect to a prosecution. The only factors that a Crown Attorney should be required to consider are whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute and whether the rights of the accused are being protected during the process. The imposition of a duty of care, which does not strike the important balance of interests between claimants and Crown Attorneys as in malicious prosecution or the intentional failure to disclose cases, risks distorting criminal prosecutions by inserting extraneous factors.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>Reliance <UNDER>on the Decision of the Superior Court of Justice in</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> is Misguided</TI>
<P>42. In attempting to negate all previous case law regarding Crown Attorney liability as irrelevant, the appellants rely heavily on the decision of the motion judge in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>. <EM>Smith</EM> <UNDER>was</UNDER> the only Canadian case to find that a Crown Attorney may owe a private law duty of care to a police officer, <UNDER>or to anyone, and has now been overturned by a unanimous panel of the Divisional Court.</UNDER>

<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, <UNDER>(Div. Ct. appeal decision), <EM>supra</EM>.</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>43. <UNDER>The Divisional Court found that the motion decision in <EM>Smith</EM> was wrongly decided because:</UNDER></P>
<P>1) <UNDER>The motion judge erred in finding that the existing case law with respect to Crown Attorney liability was not applicable because it dealt with the rights of individual citizens and not the police (as did Stinson J. on the motion below). The Divisional Court found that it was plain and obvious that given existing appellate authority on prosecutorial immunity, which required malice or intentional nondisclosure to find liability, the claim in negligence would fail.</UNDER></P>
<P>2) <UNDER>The motion judge erred in drawing a distinction between existing jurisprudence and the case before her on the basis of the identity of the complainant. There was no justification for the conclusion that the scope of prosecutorial immunity should be different when the police, rather than a member of the public, was claiming negligence.</UNDER></P>
<P>3) <UNDER>The scope of immunity of Crown Attorneys does not depend on the function performed. The Divisional Court noted that <EM>Nelles</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM> make clear that the functional approach to determining Crown Attorney liability is &ldquo;both impractical and unsound&rdquo;. Even if the functional approach were applicable, all actions taken within the sphere of core prosecutorial discretion would be protected by immunity.</UNDER></P>
<P>4) <UNDER>The motion judge erred in her conclusions regarding the policy considerations at issue in determining the question before her. The Divisional Court found that the policy considerations articulated by the Supreme Court in <EM>Henry</EM> and the malicious prosecution trilogy were implicated whenever there is a risk of undue interference with the ability of prosecutors to carry out their duties, which it found there was in the case before it. Unlike the motions judge, the Divisional Court found that the policy considerations could be determined on the basis of the existing Supreme Court jurisprudence, and did not require additional evidence. The policy considerations discussed in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence lead to the conclusion that there should not be a further exception to immunity for civil claims.</UNDER>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> (appeal decision), <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 24&ndash;38</P1></P>
<P>44. <UNDER>Because the Divisional Court decided the appeal on the basis of prosecutorial immunity, it found it unnecessary to deal with the second issue on the appeal: whether Crown Attorneys owe a duty of care to the police, and as a result expressed no opinion on the motion judge's duty of care analysis. However, the Attorney General submits that the motion judge erred in the analysis of the duty of care.</UNDER> Her Honour did not conduct any analysis of why a police officer who relies on legal advice <UNDER>from a</UNDER> Crown is in a closer or more proximate relationship to a Crown Attorney than a person whom a Crown Attorney has prosecuted who could lose their liberty as a result of a Crown Attorney's actions. <UNDER>Further</UNDER>, there was no analysis of why the reasonably foreseeable harm of a lawsuit if a police officer were to rely on negligent legal advice is more deserving of protection than the reasonably foreseeable harm of wrongful incarceration.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> (appeal decision), <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 39</P1></P>
<P>45. <UNDER>It is the Attorney General's position that the Divisional Court's decision on the <EM>Smith</EM> appeal is correctly decided and well-founded on binding appellate jurisprudence. In any event, it is also the Attorney General's position that the duty of care alleged by the motion judge in</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> <UNDER>is completely distinguishable from the duty of care alleged in this case.</UNDER><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Smith</EM>, the motion judge found that proximity between the officers and the Crown Attorneys was supported by four factors which are not present in this case:
<P1>i) In pleading that they had relied on the legal advice given by the Crown Attorneys in good faith and made decisions about the investigation based on that advice, the police met the representations and reliance aspect of the proximity test. In this case, the appellants did not plead representations and reliance (although they relied on this aspect Although they have not pleaded representations and reliance, the appellants did rely on this aspect of the proximity test in defence to the motion to strike by alleging that they relied on the Crown Attorneys. However, this is insufficient to sustain an argument in representations and reliance. In order to establish representations and reliance, one must plead that representations were made on which a party relied to his or her detriment either by failing to take action or taking a certain action as a result of the representations and suffered harm as a result. <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>.</P1>
<P1>ii) The previous recognition of the existence of solicitor-client privilege as between the police and the Crown in the case law, specifically in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Campbell</SOC></CASEREF>. In this case, there has been no previous recognition of any duty of care akin to the private law relationship between a Crown Attorney and a witness/investigating police officer alleged in the Claim;</P1>
<P1>iii) The recognition that Crown Attorneys are subject to the same ethical obligations as other lawyers in the Supreme Court's decision in <EM>Krieger</EM> and that ethical obligations include the provision of competent legal advice to a client. There is no ethical obligation akin to what is being alleged in the Claim; and</P1>
<P1>iv) There was insufficient evidence regarding the policy implications of how a tort claim for negligent legal ad vice would interfere in the relationship between the two important parts of the justice system. In this case, it is submitted that the policy implications are evident. The duty alleged would require a Crown to consider the interests of the police in deciding on whether or how to proceed with a prosecution and this would engage all the policy considerations set out in <EM>Henry</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>Consequently, the decision of Matheson J. in <EM>Smith</EM> is not a relevant or applicable authority on the issue of whether proximity should be recognized in this case.

<P>46. <UNDER>In any event, even if the duty of care alleged in</UNDER> <EM>Smith</EM> <UNDER>was analogous to the duty alleged in this case</UNDER>, the <EM>Anns</EM> test must still be applied rigorously. In <CASEREF><SOC>Childs v. Desormeaux</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court warns against imposing a duty of care based on analogy:
<QUOTE><P>The differences just discussed mean that the existence of a duty on the part of commercial providers of alcohol cannot be extended by simple analogy to the hosts of a private party. The duty proposed in this case is novel. We must therefore ask whether a duty of care is made out on the two-stage Anns test.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>F.</N><TI>Duty of Care Would Conflict With, Not Complement, a Crown Attorney's Duties</TI>
<P>47. The appellants assert that finding a duty of care in this case would not conflict with the duties of Crown Attorneys, but rather that a duty of care <UNDER>&ldquo;harmonizes with and compliments</UNDER>&rdquo; their duties. The motion judge considered and rejected this argument, finding that &ldquo;Crown Attorneys should not have to consider the interests of police officers in deciding whether to bring or stay proceedings, both because such a duty would conflict with core prosecutorial discretion and because any harm would be too remote&rdquo;. The motion judge was correct in making this finding. <UNDER>To require Crown Attorneys to essentially act as the defence counsel for police officers as suggested at paragraph 89 of the appellants' factum would create a direct conflict with a Crown Attorney's public duty to the administration of justice.</UNDER>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at para. 110</P1></P>
<P>48. In paragraph 67 of their factum, the appellants list a number of alleged duties of Crown Attorneys. To the extent that these duties have been recognized, each has been found to be owed to <EM>the accused</EM> and to <EM>the administration of justice</EM>&mdash;not to the police or other participants in the justice system. The appellants have not proffered any authority, civil or criminal, which supports the proposition that a Crown Attorney owes a police officer any duty of any kind in the conduct of a prosecution.</P>
<P>49. The appellants have also failed to cite any authority in which it has been found that a Crown Attorney may not, or should not, concede a <EM>Charter</EM> breach by police and no authority which indicates that a Crown Attorney must oppose applications for a declaration that an accused's <EM>Charter</EM> rights have been breached. As noted by the appellants, the Crown owes a duty to the accused to be scrupulously fair. A Crown Attorney owes no duty to a police officer in the course of a criminal prosecution.</P>
<P>50. The appellants suggest that the alleged duty would complement a Crown Attorney's duty &ldquo;to ensure all relevant evidence is put before the Court in support of a conviction&rdquo;. It is clear from many of the authorities cited by the appellants that it is not the role of the Crown Attorney to secure a conviction. It is a Crown Attorney's duty to prosecute only where there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute. Surely, it cannot be the duty of a Crown to proceed with a prosecution where they have determined a <EM>Charter</EM> breach has raised an issue of involuntariness with respect to a confession.</P>
<P>51. In any event, the appellants' argument that the alleged duty of care would complement rather than conflict with a Crown Attorney's duties is built on the erroneous premise that the duties of Crown Attorneys set out at paragraph 67 of their factum are somehow owed to police. It is clear they are instead owed to the accused and to the public at large.</P>
<P><UNDER>51. a. Further, the appellants' argument at paragraph 90 of their factum that the policy considerations articulated in <EM>Henry</EM> and <EM>Nelles</EM> would not be engaged in this particular case must be rejected. In <EM>Henry</EM>, the Supreme Court found that such policy considerations are engaged whenever the expansion of Crown Attorney liability is being considered. Moreover, it is the very fact that Crown Attorneys would be forced to consider the interests of police in exercising their prosecutorial discretion that engages the policy considerations.</UNDER></P>
<P>52. The public nature of a Crown Attorney's duties, which are derived from statutes such as the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> and <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, were recognized by the Supreme Court in <EM>Miazga</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>In exercising their discretion to prosecute, Crown prosecutors perform a function inherent in the office of the Attorney General that brings the principle of independence into play. Its fundamental importance lies, not in protecting the interests of individual Crown attorneys, but in advancing the public interest by enabling prosecutors to make discretionary decisions in fulfilment of their professional obligations without fear of judicial or political interference, thus fulfilling their <EM>quasi-</EM> judicial role as &ldquo;ministers of justice&rdquo;:..L'Heureux-Dub&ea; J. acknowledged the importance of limiting judicial oversight of Crown decisions in furtherance of the public interest:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he Attorney General is a member of the executive and as such reflects, <UNDER>through his or her prosecutorial function, the interest of the community to see that justice is properly done</UNDER>. The Attorney General's role in this regard is not only to protect the public, but also to honour and express the community's sense of justice. Accordingly, <UNDER>courts should be careful before they attempt to &ldquo;second-guess&rdquo; the prosecutor's motives when he or she makes a decision</UNDER>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Thus, the public good is clearly served by the maintenance of a sphere of unfettered discretion within which Crown attorneys can properly pursue their professional goals. (citations omitted)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 47 and 48</P1></P>
<P>53. In Ontario, the duties of the Attorney General are set out in section 5 of the <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM> and include: the duty to see that the administration of public affairs is in accordance with the law; to superintend all matters connected with the administration of justice in Ontario; to advise the Government upon all matters of law connected with legislative enactments and legislation; to advise the heads of the ministries and agencies of Government upon all matters of law; and to conduct and regulate all litigation for and against the Crown and to superintend all matters connected with judicial offices.
<P1><EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c M.17, <EM>s</EM>. 5</P1></P>
<P>54. The duties of a Crown Attorney are set out in section 11 of the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> and include aiding in the local administration of justice and performing duties assigned to them by law, including: examining informations setting out offences and ensuring relevant evidence with respect to such matters are brought before the Courts in a timely way; conducting prosecutions with respect to indictable and summary conviction offences; conducting summary conviction appeals; superintending private prosecutions; advising justices of the peace regarding offences; and conducting bail hearings and ensuring sureties are in place. These duties, along with those of the Attorney General, are public in nature and relate to the administration of criminal justice.
<P1><EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c C.49, <EM>s. 11</EM></P1></P>
<P>55. Moreover, one need look no further than the appellants' allegation about what the trial Crown Attorneys in this case <EM>should</EM> have done to see the conflict. Ms. Cressman was advised that the accused were going to bring <EM>Charter</EM> applications to stay their prosecutions based on the fact that their confessions were involuntary due to violence perpetrated against them by the appellants and was presented with evidence of a rib injury and allegations of other injuries such as cuts and bruises. The doctor viewing the test showing the rib injury said it was possible that the rib injury could have occurred the day of the arrest. Ms. Cressman then determined, after consulting with a senior Crown Attorney, that given the low threshold required to establish involuntariness, the confessions would be found to be involuntary. She then further determined that without the confession, she did not have a reasonable prospect of conviction against Mr. Maharaj and did not proceed against him. However, she determined that she did have a reasonable prospect of conviction against Mr. Singh, proceeded with that prosecution and dealt with the <EM>Charter</EM> breach on sentencing.</P>
<P>56. However, the appellants allege, that even given the evidence of injuries that she had, and the low threshold required to establish involuntariness, Ms. Cressman should have opposed the <EM>Charter</EM> applications, maintained the prosecution against Mr. Maharaj, searched for evidence to support the police and called them as witnesses for the purpose of defending their reputations&mdash;all regardless of her duties to the accused, and to the administration of justice and contrary to the requirement that she determine that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction before proceeding. Essentially, the appellants suggest that Ms. Cressman should have acted as their defence counsel. The conflict is clear. A Crown Attorney simply cannot be required to take the interests of the police into account in deciding how to conduct a prosecution.</P>
<P>57. The appellants cite a number of authorities discussing the relationship between Crown Attorneys and the police with respect to criminal prosecutions. While it is clear that the Crown and police must work together, it is toward the goal of furthering the administration of justice, a quintessentially public duty. There is no indication that the relationship gives rise to a private law duty of care or a responsibility to consider the interests of the other in deciding what action to take in an investigation or a prosecution. The interests considered are that of the administration of justice. Further, as set out in the Crown Policy Manual excerpts relied on by the appellants, it is clear that the roles of police and the Crown are distinct and public in nature:
<QUOTE><P>Although Crown counsel work closely with police, the separation between police and Crown roles is of fundamental importance to the proper administration of justice ... Crown counsel will proceed with prosecutions which present a reasonable prospect of conviction and where the prosecution is in the public interest. A distinct line between these two functions, which allows both the police and Crown counsel to exercise discretion independently and objectively, forms part of a system of checks and balances.</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>Police: Relationship to Crown Counsel</P>
<P>Police have the sole responsibility for charging decisions except where the consent of the Attorney General is required by statute. Crown counsel are solely responsible for determining whether a charge is to proceed once it is laid.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>There is nothing in the relationship between Crown Attorneys and the police that indicates there is any private law duty of care owed.
<P1>Crown Policy Manual Excerpts, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 29</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>G.</N><TI>Lack of a Comparable Remedy does not Guarantee the Imposition of a Duty of Care</TI>
<P>58. It is the Attorney General's position that the motion judge was correct in determining that there were &ldquo;alternative and more proper forums for determination of allegations of police misconduct, including police complaints processes, police disciplinary tribunals and civil actions&rdquo; each of which focus &ldquo;on the types of allegations the officers in this case face and affords a proper opportunity to participate and respond to such allegations, separate and apart from the criminal process&rdquo;.
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark et al v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at para. 136</P1></P>
<P>59. While the appellants allege in their factum that &ldquo;the findings of an internal administrative process simply do not have the same force&rdquo; as a pronouncement of a Court in the justice system or in the minds of the public, this is completely speculative. The evidence gathered in, and findings of, the investigations into the appellants have not been made public so it cannot be assumed what effect they would have in the minds of the public.</P>
<P>60. In any event, the existence of another remedy in law is only one factor of many to be considered in determining whether a duty of care should be imposed:
<QUOTE><P>This brings us to the second stage of the Anns test. As the majority of this Court held in Norsk, at p. 1155, residual policy considerations fall to be considered here. These are not concerned with the relationship between the parties, but with the effect of recognizing a duty of care on other legal obligations, the legal system and society more generally. Does the law already provide a remedy? Would recognition of the duty of care create the spectre of unlimited liability to an unlimited class? Are there other reasons of broad policy that suggest that the duty of care should not be recognized?</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Cooper v. Hobart</SOC><CITE>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 537</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 14</P1></P>
<P>61. While it is correct that the alternative remedies available to the appellants do not afford an opportunity for damages, the availability of damages is not a prerequisite to finding that there is another available remedy. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court determined that the ability to launch an appeal with respect to child protection proceedings provided an adequate remedy such that imposing a duty of care, and a cause of action for damages, was not required. In this case, the Attorney General submits that broad policy considerations and the spectre of indeterminate liability far outweigh the fact that the appellants will be denied a means to obtain damages.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ADDITIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE RESPONDENT</TI>
<P>62. Although the Attorney General was ultimately successful on the negligence issue, it is submitted that the motion judge made two errors in his analysis:
<P1>1) By failing to find that the existing case law regarding Crown Attorney liability was dispositive of the negligence issue; and</P1>
<P1>2) By finding there was proximity between the appellants and the Crown Attorneys.</P1></P>
<P>The Attorney General requests that this Court exercise its error correcting function with respect to those errors.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 8, 10 and 28</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Existing Case Law Should Have Been Dispositive of the Issues on the Motion</TI>
<P>63. As noted above, the case law of the Supreme Court and this Court makes clear that there is no cause of action in negligence against a Crown Attorney <EM>vis a vis</EM> an accused person. It is submitted that there is no principled basis why this jurisprudence should not apply where the claimant is an investigating police officer. As noted above, the policy considerations for negating a duty of care in the malicious prosecution trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM> are even more salient where the claimant is an investigating police officer.</P>
<P>64. In coming to the conclusion that the existing case law was not dispositive of the issues on the motion, the motion judge relied heavily on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and did not conduct any analysis as to why the Supreme Court dicta regarding negligence did not have the same force with respect to the appellants. Although the motion judge noted that leave to appeal from the <EM>Smith</EM> decision had been granted, he did not note that it was on the basis that there was good reason to doubt the correctness of the decision. <UNDER>And of course, as noted above, this approach was found to be in error by the Divisional Court on the <EM>Smith</EM> appeal.</UNDER></P>
<P>65. In <EM>Nelles</EM>, the Supreme Court rejected the American approach to prosecutor liability which held that prosecutors enjoyed absolute immunity from liability where the functions they performed were quasi-judicial in nature, but could be liable with respect to &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; or &ldquo;investigative&rdquo; functions. The line between these functions turned out to be difficult to draw in practice and the Supreme Court rejected the American approach as unprincipled; and instead it imposed liability for all functions only where the strict test for malicious prosecution was met.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 15&ndash;27</P1></P>
<P>66. In finding that the existing case law which soundly rejects a cause of action in negligence against Crown Attorneys did not apply where the claimant was someone other than an accused, the motion judges in this case and in <EM>Smith</EM> essentially applied a functional approach. Although they accepted that a Crown Attorney could not be liable in negligence <EM>vis a vis</EM> an accused person, they found that a Crown Attorney may be liable when performing a function other than deciding whether to initiate or continue a prosecution, i.e. when providing legal advice or when determining whether or not to concede an alleged <EM>Charter</EM> breach by police. This does not accord with the principals first articulated in <EM>Nelles</EM> and reiterated in <EM>Proulx, Miazga</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM>. Further, as noted above, the motion judge in this case and <EM>Smith</EM> performed no analysis as to <EM>why</EM> the appellants should be afforded a remedy not available to a former accused person.</P>
<P>67. It is submitted that the motion judge erred in failing to find the existing case law was not dispositive of the issues on the motion, and in going on to perform the <EM>Anns</EM> analysis to determine whether a duty of care exists.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Motion Judge Erred in Finding Proximity Between the Appellants and the Crown Attorneys</TI>
<P>68. The motion judge also erred in finding that there was proximity between the police and the Crown Attorneys. Specifically, the motion judge failed to consider whether there was a conflict between the public nature of the duties of a Crown Attorney and the private law duty of care alleged at the proximity stage of the duty of care analysis. Had he done so, it is submitted the motion judge would not have found a proximate relationship.</P>
<P>69. To establish &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; a plaintiff must prove that a defendant had a sufficiently close and direct, or &ldquo;proximate&rdquo;, relationship to them such that the failure to take reasonable care might foreseeably cause loss or harm to the plaintiff.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 39</P1></P>
<P>70. Proximity and foreseeability are two aspects of one inquiry: the inquiry into whether the facts disclose a relationship that gives rise to a <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care at common law. Foreseeability is the touchstone of negligence law. However, not every foreseeable outcome will attract a commensurate duty of care. Foreseeability must be grounded in a relationship of sufficient closeness, or proximity, to make it just and reasonable to impose an obligation on one party to take reasonable care not to injure the other. For example, a government actor may reasonably foresee that some of his or her decisions made in the public interest may negatively impact an individual. However, this is not enough to create a duty of care. A relationship of proximity must first exist.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 41</P1></P>
<P>71. Legislation plays an important role in determining whether a government actor owes a <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care. An alleged duty of care may arise explicitly or by implication from the statutory scheme. It may also arise where the alleged duty of care arises from interactions between the claimant and the government, which is not negated by statute. The first situation will be rare as most statutes are &ldquo;aimed at public goods&rdquo; and do not lend themselves to an inference that the legislature intended to create a private law duty of care. Where an alleged duty of care is found to conflict with an overarching statutory or public duty there is also a compelling policy reason for refusing to find proximity. Such a conflict exists where the imposition of the proposed duty of care would prevent the defendant from effectively discharging its statutory duties:
<QUOTE><P>In <EM>Cooper</EM>, for example, a duty to individual investors on the part of the Registrar of Mortgage Brokers was rejected because it was found to &ldquo;potentially conflict with the Registrar's overarching duty to the public&rdquo;...Similarly, in <EM>Edwards</EM> a private law duty of care on the part of the Law Society to the victim of a dishonest lawyer was rejected at the proximity stage since &ldquo;[d]ecisions made by the Law Society require the exercise of legislatively delegated discretion and involve pursuing a myriad of objectives consistent with public rather than private law duties&rdquo; ... In both cases, the serious negative policy consequences of these conflicting duties were found to justify denying a finding of proximity. (citations omitted)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras.43 -44</P1></P>
<P>72. The second situation where proximity might exist is where a duty of care arises due to a series of specific interactions between a government actor and the claimant. In these cases, the government actor may have made representations on which a claimant relied to their detriment (either by failing to do something based on the representation or taking some action because of the representation). Through this conduct the government actor may have entered into a special relationship with the plaintiff sufficient to establish proximity. However, even in these cases the governing statute is still relevant to the analysis&mdash;if the finding of proximity would conflict with the state's general public duty established by statute it is unlikely that a finding of proximity would arise. In this case, the appellants have not pleaded that there were representations on which they relied to their detriment. However, on the motion below they argued that specific interactions did give rise to a duty of care.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras.45, 51&ndash;55</P1>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, June 13, 2017, <CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, Appeal Book, Tab 6, at para. 98</P1></P>
<P>73. Where a statute establishes only general duties to the public and no private law duties to particular individuals no private law duty of care will be imposed.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras.50</P1></P>
<P>74. In this case, the appellants allege that the Crown Attorney with carriage of the prosecutions against Mr. Singh and Mr. Maharaj owed them a duty of care because:
<QUOTE><P>41. Any careless, negligent and/or unlawful decisions made by a crown attorney, during the course of a prosecution, could result in irreparable harm to the livelihood and reputation of the investigating police officers. The prosecution is conducted under the sole discretion of the crown attorney, and a police officer is powerless to ensure that there is no injustice to themselves or the administration of justice. As a result, this foreseeability and proximity establishes a prima face duty of care that the crown attorney has to the investigating police officers.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 41, Appeal Book, Tab 6</P1></P>
<P>75. However, this does not accord with the established jurisprudence with respect to a finding of proximity. As noted above, it may well be that a Crown Attorney could foresee that a decision he or she makes in the course of a prosecution in the public interest may have a negative impact on an individual associated with a prosecution (i.e. a police officer, witness or complainant). However, foreseeability is not sufficient to establish a duty of care. A proximate relationship must first exist. It is the Attorney General's position that a proximate relationship cannot be found to exist between an investigating police officer and a Crown Attorney because such a relationship would be in direct conflict with the public nature of a Crown Attorney's duties, which are derived from statutes such as the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> and <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, and which have been set out in detail above.</P>
<P>76. The motion judge failed to consider this potential conflict at the proximity stage of the duty of care analysis. Instead, the motion judge considered the potential conflict at the second stage of the analysis, where he found that such a conflict existed and negated a duty of care. It is submitted that the motion judge found proximity based on reasonable foreseeability alone. Had the motion judge examined the potential for a conflict in duties at the correct stage of the analysis he would not have found a proximate relationship existed. Although the Attorney General was ultimately successful on the negligence issue, this is an important issue with respect to the development of Crown Attorney liability and should be corrected.

<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> the Attorney General of Ontario (hereafter, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD>), appeals to the Divisional Court from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson, dated January 4, 2017, made in Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the judgment be set aside and an Order be made:</P>
<P>1. Allowing the Appellant's motion to strike out and dismiss the Respondents' Statement of Claim on the basis that it is statute-barred by section 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act 2002</EM>, S.O. 2002, c 2 4, Sch. B;</P>
<P>2. The costs of the appeal; and,</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Claim</TI>
<P>1. The Respondents, officers with the Toronto Police Service, commenced the underlying action alleging negligence and misfeasance against the Attorney General for the alleged conduct of two Assistant Crown Attorneys and one appellate Crown Counsel in the course of the criminal prosecution of Randy Maharaj and Neil Singh for armed robbery.</P>
<P>2. The Respondents, who conducted the investigation which led to the prosecution, allege that the prosecutors were negligent or acted deliberately in failing to rebut allegations by the accused individuals that the Respondents assaulted them following their arrest.</P>
<P>3. Prosecutors obtained a stay of the charges against Mr. Maharaj in November 2011, but proceeded against Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh was convicted, but received a reduced sentence in July 2012 due to the alleged conduct of the Respondents.</P>
<P>4. The Superior Court issued decisions which were critical of the Respondents' conduct on March 28, 2012 and July 27, 2012. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal overturned Mr. Singh's conviction on the basis of the alleged abuse and issued reasons critical of the Respondents. These decisions, including the criticism of the Respondents, were the subject of contemporaneous media coverage.</P>
<P>5. On June 22, 2016, the Respondents commenced this action against the Attorney General by issuing the Statement of Claim (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>6. The Respondents Claim admits that they knew the salient material facts relating to their claim against the trial Crown Attorneys prior to the argument of Mr. Singh's appeal on October 18, 2013. The Claim also suggests the Respondents knew the material facts relating to the claim against the appellate Crown counsel on, or around, December 12, 2013. Finally, the Claim states that the Respondents waited several months after the Court of Appeal released its decision on December 12, 2013 before seeking legal advice regarding their claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The motion to strike</TI>
<P>7. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim on the basis that it was plain and obvious that it is statute-barred pursuant to s. 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> because it was commenced more than two years after the respondents discovered the material facts on which the Claim is based.</P>
<P>8. The Attorney General also moved to strike the claim because it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. The motion was bifurcated and the limitations issue was heard on October 25, 2016 before the Honourable Justice Stinson (the <BOLD>&ldquo;motion judge&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>9. On the limitation issue, the Attorney General asserted that it was plain and obvious that the respondents were aware of the material facts giving rise to the Claim in relation to the Assistant Crown Attorneys at trial by July 2012, the date of the last trial ruling.</P>
<P>10. The Attorney General argued that the Respondents were aware of the material facts giving rise to the Claim as against the appellate Crown Counsel by December 12, 2013, the date of the Court of Appeal's ruling.</P>
<P>11. While the Respondents served notice of their intention to commence a claim against the Attorney General on October 20, 2015, they did not commence the Claim until June 22, 2016, almost four years after the last trial decision, in July 2012, and more than two years and six months after the Court of Appeal's decision, in December 2013.</P>
<P>12. In response to the motion, the Respondents asserted that the matter could not be resolved on a Rule 21 motion because the Claim raised live factual issues regarding the limitation period. In particular, the Respondents asserted that they did not know that a lawsuit was the appropriate means to seek a remedy, an element of discoverability under section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, until they met with counsel &ldquo;several months after&rdquo; the release of the Court of Appeal's decision and &ldquo;discovered their cause of action&rdquo;. They also argued that they required legal advice to discover their claim because it was &ldquo;novel&rdquo;, although this is not pleaded in the Claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge</TI>
<P>13. On January 4, 2017, the motion judge released his decision dismissing the Attorney General's motion on the limitations issue. The motion judge held that the action was not one of the exceptional cases in which a limitations issue could be decided on a Rule 21 motion because the underlying issues in the action were factually and/or legally complex.</P>
<P>14. The motion judge held that although, generally, &ldquo;the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop a limitation period from running&rdquo; an exception exists where a plaintiff is asserting a novel cause of action.</P>
<P>15. Based on the recognition of this exception, the motion judge held that because the Respondents are asserting a new kind of right&mdash;i.e. the existence of a duty of care owed by prosecutors to investigating police officers&mdash;it was inappropriate to determine in a Rule 21 motion the question of whether the Respondents should have known that a lawsuit was an appropriate means to seek a remedy before they obtained legal advice.</P>
<P>16. The motion judge did not address the admission by the Respondents in the Claim that they did not seek legal advice until several months after the release of the Court of Appeal's decision.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Honourable Motion Judge Erred</TI>
<P>17. Stinson J. erred in law by:
<P1>i. Failing to apply the proper legal test on a motion to strike based on the expiry, of a limitation period before a statement of defence is filed;</P1>
<P1>ii. Finding that there is an exception to the general rule that discoverability is dependent on when a claimant knew the material facts necessary to commence an action, and not when that claimant received legal advice regarding the legal significance of those facts, where the claim asserted is &ldquo;novel&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>iii. Finding that a motion to strike based on an expired limitation period should not be granted where underlying issues in the action, not related to the limitations issue, are factually or legally complex;</P1>
<P1>iv. Misapplying and misinterpreting <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. V. CUMIS General Insurance</SOC><YEAR>2010</YEAR><CITE>104 O.R. (3d) 16</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, which did not deal with a motion to strike on the basis of a limitation period; and</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> the Attorney General of Ontario (hereafter, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD>), appeals to the Divisional Court from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson, dated June 13, 2017, made in Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the judgment be set aside and an Order be made:</P>
<P>1. Allowing the Appellant's motion to strike out and dismiss the Respondents' allegations of misfeasance in public office for the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action and for the failure to plead the constituent elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office;</P>
<P>2. The costs of the appeal; and,</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Claim</TI>
<P>1. The Respondents, officers with the Toronto Police Service, commenced the underlying action alleging negligence and misfeasance in public office (&ldquo;misfeasance&rdquo;) against the Attorney General for the alleged conduct of two Assistant Crown Attorneys and one appellate Crown Counsel in the course of the criminal prosecution of Randy Maharaj and Neil Singh for armed robbery.</P>
<P>2. The Respondents, who conducted the investigation which led to the prosecution, allege that the prosecutors were negligent or acted deliberately in failing to rebut allegations by Mr. Singh and Mr. Maharaj that the Respondents had assaulted them following their arrest.</P>
<P>3. Prosecutors obtained a stay of the charges against Mr. Maharaj in November 2011, but proceeded against Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh was convicted, but received a reduced sentence in July 2012 due to the alleged conduct of the Respondents.</P>
<P>4. The Superior Court issued decisions in the criminal proceedings which were critical of the Respondents' conduct on March 28, 2012 and July 27, 2012. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal overturned Mr. Singh's conviction on the basis of the alleged abuse and issued reasons critical of the Respondents. These decisions, including the criticism of the Respondents, were the subject of contemporaneous media coverage.</P>
<P>5. On June 22, 2016, the Respondents commenced this action against the Attorney General by issuing the Claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The motion to strike</TI>
<P>6. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim on the basis that it is statute-barred pursuant to s. 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> because it was commenced more than two years after the Respondents discovered the material facts on which the Claim is based.</P>
<P>7. The Attorney General also moved to strike the claim on the basis that it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action because Crown Attorneys are not liable for negligence and misfeasance, particularly with respect to the Respondents in this matter (investigating police officers). Stinson J. bifurcated the motion and the limitations issue was heard on October 25, 2016.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge on the limitations issue</TI>
<P>8. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision dismissing the Attorney General's motion on the limitations issue. He held that the action was not one of the exceptional cases in which a limitations issue could be decided on a Rule 21 motion because the underlying issues in the action were factually and/or legally complex. He further held that because the claim was novel, it could not have been discovered until the Respondents sought legal advice.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The motion to strike on the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action issue</TI>
<P>9. On this portion of the motion, the Attorney General took the position that there was no cause of action against a Crown Attorney in negligence or misfeasance based on the quartet of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with Crown Attorney liability (<CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 170</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec</SOC><CITE>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 9</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC><CITE>[2009] 3 S.C.R. 339</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>[2015] 2 S.C.R. 214</CITE></CASEREF>) and the dicta of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <CASEREF><SOC>Thomson v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1998] O.J. No. 3917</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC><YEAR>2005</YEAR><CITE>205 O.A.C. 188</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Miguna v. Ontario</SOC><YEAR>2005</YEAR><CITE>205 O.A.C. 257</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 5566</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>10. Alternatively, with respect to the negligence allegations, the Crown argued there was no duty of care owed by Crown Attorneys to investigating police officers because there was no proximity and residual policy considerations negated a duty of care.</P>
<P>11. Alternatively, with respect to the misfeasance allegations, the Attorney General argued that courts are loath to review the discretionary and tactical decisions made by Crown Attorneys in the criminal context short of flagrant impropriety and the civil court should be equally or more loath to do so in the civil context.</P>
<P>12. Further, the Attorney General argued that the residual policy considerations negating a duty of care in negligence also negate the imposition of liability for misfeasance, particularly in a case such as this, where the Respondents were not the subjects of the prosecution.</P>
<P>13. Finally, Ontario argued that the pleadings with respect to negligence and misfeasance were bald and otherwise did not conform to the rules of pleading.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge on the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action issue</TI>
<P>14. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. issued his decision on the part of the motion to strike based on the failure to. disclose a reasonable cause of action. Stinson J. struck the allegations in negligence, but allowed the action to continue with respect to some of the allegations of misfeasance.</P>
<P>15. Stinson J. found that the claim in misfeasance was different from the claim in negligence because misfeasance was a recognized cause of action, whereas the negligence claim was an attempt to extend the liability of Crown Attorneys to a new sphere. As a result, he held that his analysis would be different, and would be limited to a review of the claim to determine whether it contains sufficient allegations that, if proven, would establish the cause of action.</P>
<P>16. Stinson J. found that the ability of the criminal court to review the discretionary and tactical decisions of a prosecutor was not as circumscribed as the Attorney General argued and was not a basis to find that the claim in misfeasance was untenable. He further found that the allegations in the statement of claim, if proven, could give rise to liability in misfeasance. With respect to the existence of an unlawful act, a required element in a claim for misfeasance, Stinson J. agreed with the Respondents that a breach of the Crown Attorney's duties and oath of office under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990 c. C.49 could qualify.</P>
<P>17. In arriving at his decision on misfeasance, Stinson J. did not conduct any analysis with respect to the policy considerations regarding the expansion of Crown Attorney liability set out in <EM>Nelles</EM> or <EM>Henry</EM> on which he relied to strike the negligence claim. Stinson J. made no finding as to whether those policy considerations had any bearing on his decision to expand Crown Attorney liability to include claims in misfeasance. Stinson J. allowed the claim for misfeasance in public office to continue in respect of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct absent any allegations of malice, which the Courts have consistently required to establish liability in all cases alleging civil liability for non<EM>-Charter</EM> claims for damages.</P>
<P>18. In deciding the motion, Stinson J. refused to consider any documents incorporated by reference into the Claim, or conduct any analysis of the law which permits the consideration of such evidence on a Rule 21 motion.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Honourable Motion Judge Erred</TI>
<P>19. Stinson J. erred in law by:
<P1>i) Declining to consider the documents incorporated by reference in the statement of claim in deciding the motion, even though the consideration of such evidence is permissible on a Rule 21 motion;</P1>
<P1>ii) Finding that the Supreme Court quartet and the Court of Appeal decisions in <EM>Thomson, Gilbert, Miguna</EM> and <EM>Brummell</EM> were not dispositive of the issues on the motion;</P1>
<P1>iii) Finding that the misfeasance claim differed from the negligence claim in that it was a recognized cause of action against Crown Attorneys and therefore required a different analysis;</P1>
<P1>iv) Failing to analyze the policy considerations set out in <EM>Nelles</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM> regarding the expansion of the Crown Attorney liability in the context of the claim for misfeasance;</P1>
<P1>v) Relying on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2016] O.J. No. 6163</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, when this Court found that there is good reason to doubt the correctness of that decision and granted leave to appeal (<CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2017] O.J. No. 2370</CITE></CASEREF>); and,</P1>
<P1>vi) Failing to find that the elements of the cause of action of misfeasance were not properly pleaded in the claim, and failing to strike a non<EM>-Charter</EM> claim for damages alleging prosecutorial misconduct absent allegations of malice.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Other Grounds</TI>
<P>20. Rules 21, 25 and 62.02 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg 194;</P>

<P1>ii. The Order of the Honourable Justice Stinson regarding the misfeasance allegations dated June 13, 2017 is interlocutory; and</P1>

<P>Counsel for the Appellant, Attorney General of Ontario</P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This is an appeal by the Attorney General of Ontario (Ontario) from the January 4, 2017 decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson, which dismissed Ontario's motion to strike out the respondents' statement of claim and dismiss their action due to the expiry of the applicable limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pursuant to the March 7, 2018 Order of this Court, this appeal is to be heard at the same time as both parties' appeals from the June 13, 2017 decision of Stinson J. arising out of Ontario's motion to strike out the respondents' statement of claim on the basis that it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Ontario submits that Stinson J. erred in declining to strike the claim as being statute-barred and the appeal should be granted.</P>
<P>2. The respondents are police officers with the Toronto Police Service (TPS) and were the investigating police officers with respect to a complaint of armed robbery and forcible confinement which took place in 2009. Two individuals were charged. The Deputy Crown Attorney and Assistant Crown Attorney (Crowns) assigned to the prosecutions stayed the charges against one of the accused (Mr. Maharaj) because he alleged that his confession was involuntary as a result of an assault by two of the respondents. The other accused (Mr. Singh) was convicted, but his sentence was reduced when the trial judge found that he had also been assaulted by one of the respondents while another stood by and did not intervene. The trial Crowns exercised their prosecutorial discretion not to challenge the allegations of assault and not to call the investigating police officers to testify at Mr. Singh's trial,</P>
<P>3. Subsequent to the trial, the Professional Standards Unit of the TPS (PSU) investigated the complaints of assault. Neither Mr. Singh or Mr. Maharaj, nor the respondents, agreed to be interviewed as part of the investigation. The PSU found that the allegations of assault could not be substantiated. At the hearing of Mr. Singh's appeal, Crown counsel with carriage of the appeal advised this Court of the existence of the PSU report, but the Court declined to consider it. This Court found that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay Mr. Singh's conviction due to the conduct of the respondents and overturned his conviction.</P>
<P>4. The respondents later commenced an action alleging that Ontario is liable to them in negligence and misfeasance in public office because of the conduct of the three Crowns with carriage of the prosecutions and the appeal. The respondents al lege that the Crowns were negligent and misfeasant in failing to further investigate the claims of assault and for not calling evidence (including their testimony) to refute the allegations. They further allege that the Crown should have brought a fresh evidence application to file the PSU report with this Court on Mr. Singh's appeal.</P>
<P>5. Ontario moved to strike the action on the basis that the action was statute-barred and there was no issue of discoverability. It is plain and obvious from the allegations in the Claim that the respondents knew all of the material facts necessary to pursue their Claim more than two years prior to the issuance and service of the Claim; and because the action fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action and fails to plead the necessary material facts to support the causes of action alleged.</P>
<P>6. Stinson J. bifurcated Ontario's motion to strike and determined he would decide the limitations issue first. Stinson J. dismissed Ontario's motion to strike based on the limitation period, finding that:
<P1>1) A motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period before a statement of defence was filed was not available where the underlying issues in the action were factually or legally complex; and</P1>
<P1>2) There was an &ldquo;arguable exception&rdquo; to the general rule that a claim was discovered on the day that the material facts giving rise to the claim were known for &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims. Where a claim was novel, a claim may not be discovered until legal advice regarding a possible cause of action is received by the claimant.</P1></P>
<P>7. Ontario submits its appeal from the limitations decision should be granted because Stinson J. erred:
<P1>1) <BOLD>By applying the wrong test on the motion.</BOLD> The test on a motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period before the close of pleadings is whether it is plain and obvious that there are no other facts that could be pleaded to alter the conclusion that the limitation period has expired and there is no issue of discoverability, and not whether the underlying issues in the action are factually or legally complex;</P1>
<P1>2) <BOLD>By finding that there is an arguable exception to the general rule of discoverability for &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims.</BOLD> This Court has repeatedly held that a limitation period commences when a person has knowledge of the material facts to support his or her claim, not when they appreciate the legal significance of those facts. A person who is asserting a novel claim is in the same position as anyone else who does not appreciate the legal significance of the material facts giving rise to their claim; and</P1>
<P1>3) <BOLD>By failing to consider or conduct an analysis regarding the respondents' admission that they did not seek legal advice about a possible claim until several months after this Court's decision on the appeal in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>. The law is dear that claimants must act with diligence and must not &ldquo;sleep on their rights&rdquo;. Stinson J. failed to consider this case law or to conduct an analysis of the law in relation to the respondents' admission.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>On a motion to strike, and any appeal therefrom, the Court must assume that the facts pleaded in the Claim are true. The facts pleaded may be disputed should the action proceed.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION GIVING RISE TO THE ACTION</TI>
<P>8. The respondents investigated a complaint into an armed robbery which took place in February 2009. On June 11, 2009, the officers arrested Neil Singh and Randy Maharaj. Mr. Singh was interviewed and provided an exculpatory statement to the respondents Mr. Watts and Mr. Clark. Mr. Maharaj confessed to the crime to the respondents Mr. Watts and Mr. Belanger.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 7&ndash;9, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Attorney General (Appeal Book), Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>9. At his bail hearing on June 12, 2009, Mr. Maharaj's lawyer put on the record that his client had been injured during his arrest and had very visible bumps and scratches.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 10, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>10. The preliminary hearing for both accused was held between July 16, 2010 and November 9, 2010. The respondents were called as witnesses. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj questioned the respondents about his client's accusations of being assaulted (kicked in the head and beaten) during his arrest. They denied the assault. Mr. Singh and Mr. Maharaj were committed to stand trial.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 11, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>11. The trial commenced on November 28, 2011. Deputy Crown Attorney Sheila Cressman had carriage of the prosecution. In advance of the trial, counsel for Mr. Maharaj brought an application to stay the proceedings against him and to exclude his confession, relying on doctrines of abuse of process and voluntariness based on the allegation that he was assaulted by two of the respondents prior to his confession.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 13, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>12. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj advised Ms. Cressman that Mr. Maharaj received a serious rib injury due to an alleged assault by police after his arrest and before he gave his statement. Mr. Maharaj does not appear to have complained about this specific issue when he was admitted to Maplehurst Correctional Centre (Maplehurst) prior to trial. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj provided Ms. Cressman with a CD containing an X-ray purporting to support his allegations. Ms. Cressman spoke to Dr. Moss, a doctor at the hospital where Mr. Maharaj had been treated who told her that he had viewed the X-rays with a thoracic surgeon and that it was possible that the injuries could have occurred on the day of Mr. Maharaj's arrest. Dr. Moss also advised that such an injury could result in pain if a person were to move their arms or upper body. In his videotaped statements, Mr. Maharaj is seen moving his arms. Ms. Cressman did not seek Dr. Moss's opinion regarding whether the movements on the video were consistent with the injury having occurred on the day of the arrest.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 13&ndash;17, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>13. Ms. Cressman consulted with senior Assistant Crown Attorney Frank Armstrong, who agreed that Mr. Maharaj's statement would not be admissible as it could not be proven to be voluntary due to all of the injuries he had allegedly suffered. As a result, on November 22, 2011, Mr. Armstrong stayed the charges against Mr. Maharaj.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 18, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>14. On November 28, 2012, the trial of Mr. Singh proceeded before the Honourable Madam Justice Thorburn. Mr. Singh was convicted of armed robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement. Mr. Singh's counsel brought a <EM>Charter</EM> application to stay the conviction, relying on the evidence of his client and that of Mr. Maharaj. Mr. Maharaj testified he had been assault ed by the respondents Mr. Belanger and Mr. Clark. Mr. Singh testified that he had been assaulted by Mr. Clark while Mr. Watts stood by and did not intervene. In the Claim, the respondents allege the testimony of Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh was false.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 19, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Judgment, Thorburn J., <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC><PARANUM>1-2</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Matthew Howe, sworn September 19, 2016 (Howe Affidavit), Appeal Book, Tab 14D</P1></P>
<P>15. Ms. Cressman determined that she would not call any evidence in response to the allegations. She advised the Court that the evidence demonstrated that whatever happened to Mr, Singh was not as extreme as he suggested, but that the evidence did meet the low threshold required to establish a <EM>Charter</EM> breach. She suggested the proper remedy was not a stay of proceedings, but a reduction of sentence.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 21 - 22, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Transcript, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, March 27, 2012, at p. 92, Exhibit C to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14C</P1></P>
<P>16. On March 28, 2012, Justice Thorburn dismissed Mr. Singh's stay application. Justice Thorburn noted that the evidence of the accused had not been contradicted and found that while a stay was not warranted, Mr. Singh's sentence should be reduced due to the assault he suffered at the hands of the respondents.
<P1>Judgment, Thorburn J., <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC><PARANUM>46&ndash;51</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Exhibit D to the Howe Affidavit, Tab 14D</P1>
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 23 - 24, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>17. In paragraphs 24 to 28 of their Claim the respondents set out in great detail what occurred after Justice Thorburn's ruling, including:
<P1>1) That their reputations had been irreparably harmed by extensive media coverage which focussed on whether or not the officers had faced any ramifications for their &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>2) That after having viewed the videotaped statement of Mr. Maharaj on the night of his arrest in which he raised and moved his arms, Dr. Moss opined such movement would have been painful if the rib injury had occurred that day, and that while it was possible for the injury to have occurred on the arrest date, he believed the injury must have been older than that, and in fact, had already healed at the time of the videotaped interview.</P1>
<P1>3) That Mr. Maharaj had not complained of a rib injury while incarcerated at Maplehurst Detention Centre and none had been observed by the doctor who examined him while he was there.
<P2>Statement of Claim, at paras. 24&ndash;27, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P2></P1></P>
<P>18. With respect to Ms. Cressman, the respondents allege that &ldquo;[subsequent to Justice Thorburn releasing her reasons, the officers learned some disturbing facts with respect to Ms. Cress man's conduct&rdquo;:
<P1>i) Her only reason for contacting Dr. Moss, was to confirm in her mind, whether it was possible that the injury he suffered could have occurred on the arrest day, she did not ask any questions to prove further when the injury had likely occurred;</P1>
<P1>ii) She never met with Dr. Moss to show him the video of Mr. Maharaj's interview with the officers. Had she done so, Dr. Moss would have advised her, as he advised the investigators, that because of the movement of Mr. Maharaj during the interview, it would have been highly unlikely that he would have received his injuries at the time he said he did;</P1>
<P1>iii) She had the transcripts from Mr. Maharaj's bail hearing but did not properly review those transcripts to understand the inconsistent injuries reported then as opposed to what was reported at the time of the stay application;</P1>
<P1>iv) She had the medical records from Maplehurst as well as all the statements from all the medical staff, but did not do anything with the fact that those records and interviews clearly showed that Mr. Maharaj never complained of rib injuries at the time;</P1>
<P1>v) She did not call the officers to testify and allow them the opportunity to deny the allegations of abuse as they had done so under oath at the preliminary hearing;</P1>
<P1>vi) She did not call any witnesses or evidence to refute any of the allegations brought forward by Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh. She simply conceded a Charter breach, which left to the trial judge Justice Thorburn no choice but to rule in the way she did.&rdquo;
<P2>Statement of Claim, at para. 28, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P2></P1></P>
<P>19. The Claim contains an admission that the respondents had learned these &ldquo;disturbing facts&rdquo; about Ms. Cressman sometime after Justice Thorburn released her decision, on March 28, 2012, and before October 18, 2013, the date that Mr. Singh's appeal was argued before this Court:
<QUOTE><P>32. Before the appeal was argued, Det. Sgt. Watt met with Amy Alyea (&ldquo;Ms. Alyea&rdquo;) who was going to argue the appeal on behalf of the Crown. He advised Ms. Alyea that an egregious mistake had occurred. He advised her of what the officers had learned about Ms. Cressman's conduct. Despite this, Ms Alyea and the senior crown's [sic] she reported to: (i) took <UNDER>no</UNDER> steps to investigate further, (ii) took <UNDER>no</UNDER> steps to rectify and repair that damage that had been done to the officers' reputations or (iii) took<UNDER>no</UNDER> steps to prepare and file an application to introduce fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 32, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>20. Further, although no specific time frame is given for when the respondents learned that their reputations &ldquo;were irreparably harmed&rdquo;, media articles about the rulings of Justice Thorburn were published on May 24, 2012 and July 28, 2012.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 31, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Newspaper Articles, Exhibits <EM>&ldquo;J&rdquo;</EM> and &ldquo;K&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tabs 14J and 14K</P1>
<P1>Judgment, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, Ontario Court of Appeal, dated December 13, 2013, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14H</P1></P>
<P>21. Mr. Singh appealed his conviction and sentence. Before the appeal was heard, the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal notified the Chief of the TPS about concerns regarding the respondents' conduct. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) was notified and invoked its mandate. However, Mr. Maharaj refused to be interviewed or participate in the investigation and the SIU withdrew its mandate. However, between July 4, 2012 and October 31, 2012, the PSU conducted a review of the allegations of misconduct and use of excessive force. In a written report, the PSU concluded the use of excessive force &ldquo;could not be substantiated&rdquo;. Neither Mr. Singh or Mr. Maharaj, nor the respondents, were interviewed as part of the PSU investigation.

<P1>Toronto Police Service Court Review, dated October 31, 2012, Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14F</P1></P>
<P>22. The Claim alleges that prior to the argument of Mr. Singh's appeal, the respondent Mr. Watt spoke to the appellate Crown counsel with carriage of the appeal and advised her about what the respondents had learned about Ms. Cressman's alleged failure to investigate the allegations of assault and the contents of the PSU report. The Claim states that despite this knowledge, the appellate Crown, either negligently or deliberately, failed to advise the Court about the new material facts she had learned about the trial Crowns' conduct and the &ldquo;exculpatory findings&rdquo; with respect to the respondents, and she did this to protect her colleagues. However, the transcript of the hearing before this Court reveals that Ms. Alyea advised the Court of the existence of the PSU report and repeatedly offered to provide it for the Court's review, but the panel hearing the appeal ultimately declined to consider it.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 31&ndash;33, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Transcript, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, Ontario Court of Appeal, December 13, 2013, at pgs, 62 - 63, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14G</P1></P>
<P>23. Neither the respondents nor the Toronto Police Association moved to intervene in the appeal of Mr. Singh's conviction.
<P1>Judgment, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, Ontario Court of Appeal, dated December 13, 2013, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14H</P1></P>
<P>24. On December 12, 2013, this Court released its decision setting aside the conviction because it found that Mr. Singh was a victim of conduct &ldquo;which might well be characterized as &lsquo;torture&rsquo;&rdquo; at the hands of the respondent Mr. Clark. In the Claim, the respondents allege that this was a result of the failure of the Crown to apprise the Court of the &ldquo;new material facts that established that Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh had most certainly fabricated the allegations of assault by the officers&rdquo;.

<P>25. The Claim states that the decision of this Court was widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet and that it became the subject of conversations and communication among Crown Attorneys, the judiciary and the criminal defence bar.

<P>26. The Claim states that after the release of this Court's decision, the SIU re-opened their investigation and that this time Mr. Maharaj agreed to be interviewed. The Claim states that the SIU investigators reviewed all the records, including the videotape of Mr. Maharaj, and determined the rib injury post-dated the time of arrest and his physical demeanour during his videotaped statement was inconsistent with having sustained any rib injury. As such, the allegations were not substantiated. The report is not in evidence and it is unclear whether the report dealt with the allegations of abuse by Mr. Maharaj beyond the rib injury or with the allegations of Mr. Singh. It does not appear that the respondents were interviewed as part of the investigation.

<P>27. On May 26, 2014, the Chief of the TPS asked the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) to conduct an independent review of the review conducted by the PSU. In her report dated April 9, 2015, the OPP investigator concluded she had no reason to refute the conclusion of the PSU that the allegations could not be substantiated. It is unclear whether any additional witnesses were interviewed or evidence gathered. Ontario does not have a copy of this report.

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>THE RESPONDENTS' ACTION</TI>
<P>28. On October 20, 2015, the respondents served notice that they intended to commence an action against Ontario due to the alleged negligence and misfeasance in public office committed by Ms. Cressman, Mr. Armstrong, Ms. Alyea and &ldquo;senior officials in the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal&rdquo;, pursuant to section 7(1) of the <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM> (PACA) which requires 60-days' notice before a claim against the Crown is commenced. The Notice attached a draft claim.
<P1>Notice, <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM>, s. 7(1), served October 20, 2015, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Tab 14I Section 7(1)(2), <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 27</P1></P>
<P>29. However, the respondents did not issue and serve their claim until June 22, 2016, some eight months after serving their PACA notice. The Claim alleges that Crown Attorneys have a duty of care to investigating police officers and may be found liable in negligence and misfeasance. The respondents allege that but for the negligent and misfeasant conduct of the trial and appellate Crowns, the Superior Court and this Court would not have made the findings they did and the respondents' reputations would not have been damaged.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 42 - 43, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>30. Finally, the respondents recognized that there was a limitations issue with respect to their Claim. They plead at paragraph 50:
<QUOTE><P>50. Several months after the Court of Appeal released its judgement in December of 2013, the officers retained counsel, who had the opportunity to review the entire record, and to listen to the audio of the oral arguments that were made in the Court of Appeal. It was only then that the officers were made fully aware of the tortious conduct of the defendant, and discovered their causes of action in negligence and malfeasance in a public office.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>ONTARIO'S MOTION TO STRIKE</TI>
<P>31. Ontario brought a motion to strike out the action pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 on the basis that the action is statute-barred because the limitation period had expired. The Claim makes clear that the respondents knew all of the material facts necessary to pursue their Claim more than two years prior to the commencement of the Claim. Ontario also moved to strike the Claim on the basis that it failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action and failed to plead the material facts necessary to support the causes of action alleged. Stinson J. bifurcated the motion and determined he would decide the limitations issue first.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI>Motion on the Limitations Issue</TI>
<P>32. Ontario argued that this case was one in which a motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period could be determined before a statement of defence was filed because it was plain and obvious from a review of the Claim that no additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that the limitation period had expired before the Claim was commenced. Ontario focused on three key parts of the Claim.</P>
<P>33. The first was the admission in paragraphs 28 and 32 that the respondents had learned about Ms. Cressman's alleged misconduct sometime between the time of Justice Thorburn's decision on March 28, 2012 and the hearing of the appeal of that decision on October 18, 2013. Having failed to commence the action until June 22, 2016, the respondents had missed the limitation period for a claim arising from the conduct of the trial Crowns by at least eight months.</P>
<P>34. Second, while Ontario acknowledged that the Claim did not plead the exact date that the respondents became aware of the alleged misconduct of the appellate Crown, Ontario argued that the decision allowing Mr. Singh's appeal would have come to the respondents' attention on the date it was released, December 12, 2013, or very soon thereafter (with which Stinson J. agreed) and the limitation period would have therefore expired on December 12, 2015. However, pursuant to section 7(2) of PACA, where Notice pursuant to section 7(1) is served within the limitation period, the limitation period will be extended to the end of seven days after the expiration of the Notice period. In this case, because the Notice was served on October 20, 2015, the limitation period was extended to December 27, 2015. As a result, the respondents missed the deadline to commence a claim arising from the conduct of the appellate Crown by approximately six months.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 7(2) of the <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM> states: Where a notice of a claim is served under subsection (1) before the expiration of the limitation period applying to the commencement of an action for the claim and the sixty-day period referred to in subsection (1) expires after the expiration of the limitation period, the limitation period is extended to the end of seven days after the expiration of the sixty-day period.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>35. Finally, Ontario took the position that paragraph 50 of the Claim, which states that the respondents had not retained legal counsel until several months after the Court of Appeal decision on Mr. Singh's appeal, did not save the Claim from being statute-barred because the binding appellate authority was clear that a limitation period begins to run from the date that all materials facts are known to a claimant, not on the date on which legal advice with respect to the legal significance of those facts is received.
<P1>Factum of the Moving Party, Motion to Strike, at para. 53, Appeal Book, Tab 12</P1></P>
<P>36. In response, the respondents argued that the motion should be dismissed because striking a claim on the basis of a limitation period under Rule 21 before a statement of defence was filed should only be done in the rarest of cases, and this was not one of those cases. They also argued that there were live factual issues on the limitations issue which were expressly raised in the Claim and precluded determination of the question on a pleadings-based motion.
<P1>Endorsement, Stinson J., January 4, 2017, at para. 12, Appeal Book, Tab 9</P1></P>
<P>37. Finally, the respondents argued, although it was not pleaded in their Claim, that they did not know that a lawsuit was an appropriate means to seek a remedy until they received legal advice because the cause of action they were al leging was novel. They premised this argument on a brief statement by the Honourable Madam Justice Low of the Superior Court of Justice in <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto</SOC></CASEREF>, a 2011 decision:
<QUOTE><P>Section 5(1)(a)(iv) [of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>] does not import an idiosyncratic limitation period calibrated by the claimant's familiarity with or ignorance of the law. The test is an objective one.

<P1>Endorsement, Stinson J., January 4, 2017, at paras. 18&ndash;20, Appeal Book, Tab 9</P1></P>
<P>38. The respondents did not argue that they did not know the material facts giving rise to their Claim during the limitation period, nor did they identify what specific additional facts could be asserted with respect to the limitations issue.
<P1>Factum of the Responding Party, Appeal Book, Tab 13</P1></P>
<P>39. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. dismissed Ontario's motion to strike based on the limitation period. His Honour found that this was not one of the exceptional cases in which the limitations issue could be decided on a rule 21 motion because the underlying issues in the action were factually and/or legally complex. Stinson J, did not find that the limitations issue itself was factually or legally complex, although he stated that there could be additional, unspecified facts pleaded on the limitations issue.
<P1>Endorsement, Stinson J., January 4, 2017, at para. 12, Appeal Book, Tab 9</P1></P>
<P>40. Further, Stinson J. found that although, generally, &ldquo;the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop a limitation period from running&rdquo;, the &ldquo;arguable exception&rdquo; in <EM>Boyce</EM> applied because the respondents were asserting a new or novel cause of action. Consequently, the limitation period may not have started to run until the receipt of legal advice. Finally, Stinson J. did not address the admission made by the respondents in their Claim that they did not seek legal advice until several months after the release of the Court of Appeal's decision allowing Mr. Singh's appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario's motion to strike the Claim for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action in negligence and misfeasance was heard on February 21 and 22, 2017.

On January 26, 2018, the Divisional Court granted Ontario's motions for leave to appeal the limitations and misfeasance decisions, both of which were interlocutory decisions. The respondents appealed Stinson J.'s negligence decision as of right to this Court. On March 7, 2018, this Court ordered that Ontario's appeals be heard at the same time as the respondents' appeal on the negligence issue.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;LAW &amp; ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>41. The sole issue to be determined on this appeal is whether Stinson J. erred in dismissing Ontario's motion to strike out the respondents' Claim on the basis that the applicable limitation period had expired. It is Ontario's position that Stinson J. erred:
<P1>1) By applying the wrong test on the motion;</P1>
<P1>2) By finding that there is an exception to the general rule of discoverability for &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims; and,</P1>
<P1>3) By failing to consider or conduct any analysis regarding the respondents' admission that they did not seek legal advice until several months after the Court of Appeal's decision on the appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>1)</N><TI>MOTION TO STRIKE BASED ON A LIMITATION PERIOD IS AVAILABLE IN THIS CASE</TI>
<P>42. In <CASEREF><SOC>Beardsley v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court determined that while, generally, the expiration of a limitation period is a defence to be pleaded rather than the basis for a motion to strike, where it is plain and obvious that no additional facts could be pleaded that would alter the conclusion that the limitation period had expired such a motion is appropriate. Further, the Court found it would be unduly technical to require a defence to be delivered where the plain and obvious test is met.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Beardsley v. Ontario</SOC><YEAR>2001</YEAR><CITE>[2001] O.J. No. 4574</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at paras. 21-22, Book of Authorities, Tab 2</P1></P>
<P>43. In <CASEREF><SOC>Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc. v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court recently considered the effect of the enactment of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> on its <EM>dicta</EM> in <EM>Beardsley</EM>, and ultimately concluded that because the basic limitation period in the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> is now premised on the discoverability rule, discoverability had to form part of the test on a motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc. v. Lalonde</SOC><CITE>[2017] O.J. No. 3188</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 45, Book of Authorities, Tab 3</P1></P>
<P>44. <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> involved an appeal from a motion to strike out certain claims in a complex bankruptcy matter. One of the bases of the motion to strike was that certain causes of action pleaded were statute-barred. A determination of the limitations issue required a determination of whether the respondent was a person advancing a claim through a predecessor right under section 12 of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>, and whether the limitation period began to run when the trustee in bankruptcy had knowledge of the claim or when the bankrupt had knowledge of the claim. The motion judge found that the claims were not statute-barred because they had only been discoverable in May 2014, less than two years before the Claim was issued.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 21</P1></P>
<P>45. The issue before this Court on the appeal was whether the decision below was final, such that this Court could hear the appeal. Although the appellants did not rely on rule 21.01(1)(a) in their Notice of Motion, they argued that they had relied on it in their factum and in oral submissions on the motion, and were in fact seeking a determination on a question of law regarding the limitation period from the motion judge and that the motion judge had made findings in that regard.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 14&ndash;21</P1></P>
<P>46. However, this Court found that the appeal was interlocutory for three reasons. First, the Notice of Motion did not refer to rule 21.01(1)(a) and the formal Order from the motion simply dismissed the motion, with no reference to a determination of a question of law. Second, although the motion judge had referred to the appellant's arguments regarding rule 21.01(1)(a) in his reasons, the Court was not persuaded that his reasons intended to make a binding determination on the limitations issue. Finally, and most relevant to this appeal, the Court found that it was not satisfied that the motion judge had the authority to make a binding determination under rule 21.01(1)(a) in that case.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 25&ndash;51</P1></P>
<P>47. The Court stated that the test set out in <EM>Beardsley</EM> for motions to strike based on a limitation period before the close of pleadings &ldquo;has likely been overtaken by the enactment of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>&rdquo;. The Court also stated &ldquo;we are also of the view that the comment in <EM>Beardsley</EM> was never intended to apply to a case that is factually or legally complex&rdquo;. The Court did not cite any authority for these conclusions and it is unclear to what extent, if any, the Court heard argument on these issues. The Court noted that in stating the test, the Court in <EM>Beardsley</EM> gave the example of a matter &ldquo;where it is clear that the discoverability rule did not apply&rdquo;. Because the basic limitation period in the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> is now premised on the discoverability rule, the Court questioned whether there was any situation in which a limitations issue could be determined on a rule 21.01(1)(a) motion unless pleadings are closed and it is clear the facts are undisputed.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 42&ndash;45</P1></P>
<P>48. The Court concluded that in any event, <EM>Beardsley</EM> was not intended to apply to the situation before <EM>them</EM>&mdash;where the fact situation involving the limitation period was not straightforward and required factual determinations, and because the claim was novel in that the trustee in bankruptcy was purporting to act in a representative capacity for unsecured creditors, which was a novel role for a trustee.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 46</P1></P>
<P>49. In conclusion, the Court in <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> appears to suggest that the <EM>Beardsley</EM> test will apply where there is an undisputed fact situation in which the cause of action has accrued and to which the discoverability rule did not apply, which was unlike the case before them.
<P1><EM>Golden Oaks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 49</P1></P>
<P>50. As noted above, the extent to which the Court heard argument from the parties on the issue of the effect of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> on the test in <EM>Beardsley</EM> or the jurisdiction of the motion judge is unclear. In this regard, it may be that the Court's conclusions are <EM>obiter</EM>. In any event, <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> cannot be viewed as overturning <EM>Beardsley</EM> because a five-member panel of this Court would be required to overturn a previous decision of the Court. Certainly, <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> cautions that motions to strike on the basis of a limitation period before the close of pleadings are the exception, not the rule, and will not be permitted where discoverability is an issue. However, the decision does not stand for the proposition that such motions can never be brought.</P>
<P>51. The current test for a motion to strike on the basis of an expired limitation period prior to the close of pleadings was summarized by Perell J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Kaynes v. B.P. P.L.C.</SOC></CASEREF>, where His Honour had the opportunity to consider <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> (also cited as <CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>) and <EM>Beardsley</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>On a rule 21.01(1)(a) motion, the court may determine a limitations issue before a statement of defence is filed, where discoverability is not in issue and no additional facts could be pleaded that would alter the conclusion that a limitation period has expired: <CASEREF><SOC>Beardsley v.

<P>52. The test for such a motion is met in this case. The limitations issue in this case is straightforward and discoverability is not at issue because there are no additional facts that could be pleaded that would alter the conclusion that the respondents knew all of the material facts necessary to commence an action more than two years before their Claim was commenced.</P>
<P>53. Paragraphs 28 and 32 of the Claim make clear that the respondents learned the material facts on which they rely to support their claim against the trial Crowns after March 28, 2012 (Justice Thorburn's decision) and before the argument of Mr. Singh's appeal at this Court (October 18, 2013). Giving the respondents the benefit of the latest date, by commencing their claim on June 22, 2016, they missed the limitation period with respect to a claim against the Attorney General based on the conduct of the trial Crowns by approximately eight months. With respect to the conduct of the appellate Crown, the decision on Mr. Singh's appeal was released on December 12, 2013 and, as found by Stinson J., &ldquo;it is a reasonable inference that [it] came to the respondents' attention at that time or soon thereafter&rdquo;. As such, the limitation period would normally have expired on December 12, 2015. However, the limitation period was extended by section 7(2) of <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM> until December 27, 2015. Consequently, the respondents missed the limitation period against the appellate Crown by approximately six months.

<P1>Statement of Claim, Appeal Book at paras. 28 and 32, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>54. The respondents state in paragraph 50 of their Claim that they did not &ldquo;discover&rdquo; their claim until they received legal advice. On the motion below, they argued that this was because the Claim was novel (although this was not pleaded in the Claim). However, as will be explored more fully below, the legal advice received by the respondents did not provide them with further material facts regarding their Claim. Instead, it provided them with information about the legal effect of those facts. In those circumstances, the receipt of legal advice does not extend the limitation period, Therefore, the &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; of the respondents' Claim does not alter when the claim was &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;.</P>
<P>55. Consequently, this case does not have the complexity or novelty present in <EM>Golden</EM> Oaks and it is submitted that the limitations issue can be determined without the delivery of a Statement of Defence or Reply. The limitations issue in this case is strictly a legal question: does the novelty of the respondents' claim extend the limitation period?</P>
<P>56. Stinson J. did not have the benefit of <EM>Golden Oaks or Kaynes</EM>, both of which were released after his decision on the limitations issue. However, it is submitted that His Honour erred in the test he <EM>did</EM> apply by failing to apply <EM>Beardsley</EM> and instead finding that a motion to strike on the basis of an expired limitation period should not be permitted where the underlying issues in an action are factually or legally complex. In so doing, he relied on the following statement in the Superior Court's decision in <EM>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd</EM>.:
<QUOTE><P>... I do not accept the submission of the Credit Union that its Rule 21 motion falls within the category of cases alluded to in <EM>Beardsley</EM> &ldquo;where, it is plain and obvious from a review of a statement of claim that no additional facts could be asserted&rdquo;. In <EM>Beardsley</EM> the possibility of bringing a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion before the close of pleadings was discussed in the context of a determination as to whether an action was statute-barred&mdash;for example, such as in cases where the injuries suffered in a car accident occurred on a date certain and nothing more could be said about that fact. That type of case is a far cry from the complex claim asserted in this proceeding. [Footnote omitted.]</P></QUOTE>

<P1>Endorsement, Stinson J., January 4, 2017, at paras. 18&ndash;20, Appeal Book, Tab 9</P1></P>
<P>57. However, this was a misinterpretation and misapplication of <EM>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union</EM>. That case involved a motion under rule 21 for the determination of two complex questions of law before the close of pleadings, was not a motion to strike based on a limitation period, and did not deal with limitation periods in any way. In the paragraph relied on by Stinson J., the Court found that a rule 21 motion to strike before the close of pleadings <EM>may be appropriate in circumstances where it is plain and obvious from the statement of claim that the action had been commenced beyond the limitation period</EM>, but it was not appropriate in the case before the Court because the legal questions raised by the motion, which had nothing to do with a limitation period, were too complex.
<P1><EM>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 33</P1></P>
<P>58. Stinson J. therefore erred in relying on <EM>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union</EM>. He further erred by relying on this Court's statement in <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Real Estate Assn. v. American Home Assurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF> that &ldquo;the exception in <EM>Beardsley</EM> must be confined to cases that involve no legal or factual complexities.&rdquo; In so finding, this Court was referring to a case in which the <EM>limitations issue</EM> was factually or legally complex, not the underlying issues in the action.

<P>59. Stinson. J. made no reference to the specific paragraphs in the Claim in which the respondents set out when they learned the material facts necessary to commence their action and did not apply the plain and obvious test to those paragraphs. While the respondents argued that they should have the opportunity to plead additional facts about the limitation period in reply to a limitations defence, they failed to articulate what facts could be pleaded that would alter the conclusion that the limitation period expired. As such, it is Ontario's position that the motion judge's decision with respect to the limitation period cannot stand. Certainly, the limitation period issue must now also be assessed in the light of the dicta in <EM>Golden Oaks</EM> and <EM>Kaynes</EM>. When that test is applied to the case before this Court, it is plain and obvious that the limitation period expired before the Claim was commenced, and that there is no genuine issue of discoverability. The action should be struck as being statute-barred.</P></BLOCK3>

<P>61. However, in examining the issue of discoverability in the context of the respondents' claim, Stinson J. found:
<QUOTE><P>Generally, the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop a limitation period from running. However, there is an arguable exception for novel claims. In <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 53</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Low J. stated:

<P>Aside from the limitation issues addressed in this endorsement, the balance of the defendant's Rule 21 motion asserts that this case involves &ldquo;a new kind of right ... that has not been hitherto protected&rdquo;: i.e. the duty owed (if any) by Crown attorneys to police officers who are engaged as participants and witnesses in the criminal justice process. On this basis, the exception posited by Low J. in <EM>Boyce</EM> is engaged.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Endorsement, Stinson J., January 4, 2017, at para. 19, Appeal Book, Tab 9</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 23</P1></P>
<P>62. Stinson J. erred in finding that there is an &ldquo;arguable exception&rdquo; to the general rule that a claim is discovered when a claimant knows the material facts necessary to commence a claim where the right being asserted is &ldquo;novel&rdquo;, and that in such a case the running of the limitation period will be stopped until the claimant learns the legal significance of those material facts.</P>
<P>63. Stinson J.'s ruling was in error for four reasons:
<P1>i) The comment in <EM>Boyce</EM> regarding novel claims was <EM>obiter</EM> and has no precedential value;</P1>
<P1>ii) The comment in <EM>Boyce</EM> does not accord with the prevailing appellate authority which states that a limitation period begins to run with knowledge of material facts and not with knowledge of the legal significance of those facts, without exception;</P1>
<P1>iii) The statement in <EM>Boyce</EM> misinterprets s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> by focusing on the claimant's knowledge of their prospects rather than the process; and</P1>
<P1>iv) The respondents' case also differs significantly from the medical malpractice cases in which it was found that an expert opinion was required to learn additional material facts necessary to commence a claim.</P1></P>
<BLOCK4><N>i)</N><TI>The Statement Regarding Novel Claims in Boyce was <EM>obiter</EM></TI>
<P>64. The statement made by Low J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto</SOC></CASEREF> regarding novel claims is <EM>obiter</EM> and has no precedential value. The cause of action at issue in <EM>Boyce</EM>, battery, was not novel and no argument was made that the limitation period should be extended on that basis. Low J. did not reference any case law or conduct any analysis of the issue before making the <EM>obiter</EM> statement.</P>
<P>65. Rather, Low J. made the statement as an explanatory device, emphasizing that it was obvious that a lawsuit would objectively be seen as an appropriate means to seek a remedy in the case before her, a personal injury caused by battery, pursuant to sections 5(1)(a)(iv) and 5(b) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>.</P>
<P>66. That the statement was not intended to depart from established jurisprudence is further demonstrated by the fact that it has not been relied on in any case other than the decision below. It is submitted that in these circumstances Low J.'s statement should not be elevated to establish an &ldquo;arguable exception&rdquo; to the longstanding general rule governing discoverability discussed below.

<BLOCK4><N>ii)</N><TI>The Limitation Period Runs with the Knowledge of Material Facts, not the Appreciation of the Legal Significance of those Facts</TI>
<P>67. Low J.'s statement does not accord with binding appellate authority regarding discoverability. This Court has repeatedly held that a limitation period commences when a person has knowledge of the material facts to support his or her claim, not when they appreciate the legal significance of those facts.

<P>68. In <CASEREF><SOC>Nicholas v. Tetrault</SOC></CASEREF>, a solicitor's negligence action, the plaintiff admitted that she knew the material facts underlying her claim against her former lawyer approximately nine years before commencing her claim. However, she argued that it was not until her new lawyer advised her shortly before she commenced her claim that she may have an action in negligence against her former lawyer that she &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; her claim and the limitation period began to run. The Court rejected that argument, finding:
<QUOTE><P>The discoverability principle governs the commencement of a limitation period and stipulates that a limitation period begins to run only after the plaintiff has the knowledge, or the means of acquiring the knowledge, of the existence of the facts that would support a claim for relief... Thus, a limitation period commences when the plaintiff discovers the underlying material facts or, alternatively, when the plaintiff ought to have discovered those facts by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</P>
<P><UNDER>The circumstance that a potential claimant may not appreciate the legal significance of the facts does not postpone the commencement of the limitation period if he or she knows or ought to know the existence of the material facts, which is to say the constitute elements of his or her cause of action. Error or ignorance of the law or legal consequences of the facts does not postpone the running of the limitation period</UNDER>... [citations omitted; emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>

<P>69. In <CASEREF><SOC>Unegbu v. WFG Securities of Canada Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court upheld the motion judge's findings with respect to whether the limitation period begins to run upon knowledge of the material facts or upon the receipt of legal advice establishing the legal significance of those facts. The motions judge stated:
<QUOTE><P>It is important to note that s. 5(2) of the Act imposes a presumption that a claimant knows of the claim on the day the act or omission upon which the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is proved.</P>
<P>A party is not required to commence an action before they know that they have a &ldquo;substantial chance&rdquo; of success: see <CASEREF><SOC>Everding v. Skrijel</SOC></CASEREF>. However, <BOLD>the fact that a party does not appreciate the legal significance of the facts does not stop the limitation clock if that party knew of the material facts founding their claim:</BOLD> see <CASEREF><SOC>Nicholas v. McCarthy T&ea;trault</SOC></CASEREF>. The inquiry into the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of a claim is factual and the findings will vary from case to case. In <CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> the court explained that, &ldquo;The question to be posed is whether the prospective plaintiff knows enough facts on which to base an allegation of negligence against the defendant.&rdquo; [citations omitted]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Unegbu</EM> (S.C.J.), <EM>supra</EM> at paras. 12-13</P1></P>
<P>70. The Court rejected the plaintiff's claim that her case was similar to medical malpractice cases in which the courts had held that the limitation period did not start to run until the receipt of a medical opinion regarding the standard of care (which Courts have held provides a claimant with additional material facts relating to his or her claim and will be explored more fully below):
<QUOTE><P>The facts of this case could hardly be more different. On the plaintiff's own evidence, she believed the defendants had committed a wrong. There was no need for any advice of a technical nature to inform her that she had a cause of action. <BOLD>Even if I were to accept that the plaintiff did not realise that she could launch legal proceedings to recover her losses, the limitation period commences on the day upon which a reasonable person with the plaintiff's abilities and in her circumstances ought to have known of her remedy through a court action.</BOLD> I find that any reasonable person in the plaintiff's position ought to have known by May 2009, at the very latest, that a cause of action existed within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act. For the same reason, <BOLD>the plaintiff cannot rely on her ignorance of the law to postpone the commencement of the limitation period:</BOLD> see T&ea;trault, and <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services Board</SOC></CASEREF>. [citations omitted]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Unegbu</EM> (S.C.J.), <EM>supra</EM> at para. 22</P1></P>
<P>71. In upholding the motions judge's decision, this Court stated:
<QUOTE><P>The appellant contends that until she received letters in June and October 2011 from the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada responding to her complaint against the defendants, <BOLD>she was not aware that she had a right to sue the defendants.</BOLD> Those letters indicated that if the appellant wished to seek compensation for any loss she had suffered, she could either contact the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investment or file a lawsuit.</P>
<P>The motion judge did not err in rejecting this argument. As he correctly found at para. 22 of his reasons, <BOLD>those letters did not supply the appellant with any factual or other information that she needed to know in order to assert a claim. The appellant knew she had suffered a loss not later than May 2009 and from that date, she firmly held the view that the appellants had wrongfully cheated her of her money.</BOLD> She had two years from that date to commence an action to bring her claim within the time allowed by the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, sched. B and she failed to do so. <BOLD>It is well-established that a lack of appreciation of the legal significance of the facts grounding a claim does not stop the limitation from running:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Nicholas v. McCarthy Tetrault</SOC></CASEREF>. [citations mitted]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Unegbu</EM> (C.A), <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 3-4</P1></P>
<P>72. Although these decisions do not specifically deal with the concept of the receipt of legal advice in relation to a right which has not previously been recognized, the distinction is immaterial. The key point established by these cases is that the fact that a claimant does not know they have a cause of action does not operate to toll the limitation period.</P>
<P>73. The respondents in this action, who are sophisticated and have knowledge of the law, argued below that they did not know they had a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to sue Ontario because they are asserting a novel cause of action (which is more accurately described as the novel application of a recognized cause of action). This is the same argument made and rejected by this Court in <EM>Nicholas</EM> and <EM>Unegbu</EM>.</P>
<P>74. The &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; of the respondents' claims does not put them in a different position than the plaintiffs in <EM>Nicholas</EM> or <EM>Unegbu</EM>, or any other claimant who does not know the particular cause(s) of action that may be available to them until the receipt of legal advice. The jurisprudence is clear that ignorance of, or an error with respect to, the law cannot serve to extend a limitation period. Discoverability is focused on the knowledge of material facts and not the legal significance of those facts. As such there should be no exception to the discoverability rule for &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims.</P>
<P>75. The respondents' Claim does not include any pleading about the novelty of the claim or contend that the plaintiffs discovered any additional material facts about the conduct of the Crown Attorneys after they consulted legal counsel. Indeed, it is apparent from the facts pleaded in the Claim that the respondents believed they had been wronged by Ms. Cressman and Mr. Armstrong prior to October 18, 2013, when they took steps to address what they refer to in the Claim as an &ldquo;egregious mistake&rdquo; by raising this matter with Ms. Alyea.</P>
<P>76. Rather than relying on the purported novelty of their cause of action, paragraph 50 of the Claim states:
<QUOTE><P>50. Several months after the Court of Appeal released its judgement in December of 2013, the officers retained counsel, who had the opportunity to review the entire record, and to listen to the audio of the oral arguments that were made in the Court of Appeal. It was only then that the officers were made fully aware of the tortious conduct of the defendant, and discovered their causes of action in negligence and malfeasance in a public office.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 50, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>77. The respondents therefore plead that after consulting with counsel, they learned that the conduct of the trial and the appellate Crowns was tortious and they had causes of action in misfeasance and negligence. In other words, they plead that after consulting with legal counsel they learned the legal effect of the conduct of the Crowns&mdash;not any additional material facts regarding the conduct of the Crowns. All material facts regarding the Crown Attorneys conduct were clearly discovered in 2012 and 2013. It is submitted that the motion judge erred in relying on <EM>Boyce</EM> and in finding that there is an arguable exception to the discoverability rule for &ldquo;novel&rdquo; claims.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii)</N><TI>The comment in Boyce misinterprets s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> by focusing on the claimant's knowledge of their prospects rather than the process</TI>
<P>78. Premising the interpretation of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> on a claimant's legal knowledge misapprehends the meaning and purpose of that provision. Section 5(1)(a)(iv) requires that in order for the claim to be &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; for limitations purposes, the plaintiff must know that &ldquo;having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an <BOLD>appropriate</BOLD> means to seek to remedy it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, S.O. 2002 c. 24, Sched. B, at s. 5</P1></P>
<P>79. The provision is concerned with when a claimant knew that a lawsuit was an appropriate process to pursue, not when the claimant knew the particular grounds for the lawsuit; the defences to be contested; and the likelihood of success. While s. 5(1)(a)(iv) can have the effect of &ldquo;delaying the commencement&rdquo; of a limitation period, it does so only until a lawsuit becomes an appropriate means of recovery.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nasr Hospitaiity Services Inc. v. Intact Insurance</SOC><CITE>[2017] O.J. No. 3552</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 27&ndash;35, Book of Authorities, Tab 14</P1></P>
<P>80. The determination of when a lawsuit becomes appropriate is a question of process, not legal knowledge. For example, a lawsuit may become appropriate after other dispute resolution mechanisms are exhausted, or following recourse to statutory remedies. As this Court recently held in <CASEREF><SOC>Tapak v. Non-Marine Underwriters</SOC></CASEREF>, section 5(1)(a)(iv) &ldquo;is intended to address the situation where there may be an avenue of relief outside of a court proceeding that a party can use to remedy their &ldquo;injury, loss or damage&rdquo;.

<P>81. In <EM>Boyce</EM>, Low J. cites the prospect of a &ldquo;&lsquo;new kind of right&rdquo; in considering s. 5(1)(a)(iv) in the context of s. 5(1)(b) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>. In doing so, Low. J. was positing a circumstance in which a reasonable person would not know that a lawsuit would be the appropriate means for pursuing a remedy. However, by basing this analysis on the claimant's knowledge of a legal right, rather than his or her awareness that a lawsuit was an appropriate process for recovery, Low J. misapplied s. 5(1)(a)(iv). In elevating this analysis to an exception to discoverability, Stinson J. erred.</P>
<P>82. Reframing s. 5(1)(a)(iv) as a tool for disputing discoverability based on a claimant's legal knowledge runs counter to the goals of establishing certainty, promoting diligence and preventing unfairness which underpin limitations legislation. If this approach were accepted, any claim based on rights which are either not widely known or not yet recognized would no longer be barred by the standard two-year limitation period.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nasr Hospitality Services Inc. v. Intact Insurance</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 35</P1></P>
<P>83. The instant case demonstrates the unworkability of this approach. In opposing this motion, the respondents rely on rights premised on duties that are not yet recognized or protected in law. In particular, in their negligence claim the respondents assert rights based on an as yet unrecognized duty of care owed by Crown Attorneys to investigating police officers. In their misfeasance claim, the respondents assert a right based on a novel interpretation of the statutory oath sworn by Crown Attorneys.</P>
<P>84. If the approach in <EM>Boyce</EM> and in the Court below were adopted, the respondents and claimants like them could never &lsquo;discover&rsquo; their claim for the purposes of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>. Under this approach, as long as the right being asserted has not been recognized by a Court, a lawsuit would not be &ldquo;an appropriate means to seek a remedy&rdquo; under s. 5(1)(a)(iv). This approach misinterprets s. 5(1)(a)(iv) and would severely impair the operation of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> if allowed to stand.</P>
<P>85. The proper interpretation of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) turns on the consideration of whether a lawsuit was an appropriate means for a remedy in light of the other available options. The respondents rely on the meeting with their lawyers detailed at paragraph 50 of the Claim in arguing that the Claim is not statute-barred under s. 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>. However, that paragraph merely discusses the particulars of a lawsuit: none of the facts pleaded would serve to delay the commencement of the limitation period pursuant to s. 5(1)(a)(iv). Consequently, the limitations period began running in December 2013 at the latest and expired prior to the commencement of the Claim with respect to the allegations made both the trial and appellate Crowns.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iv)</N><TI>The Respondents' Claim differs from the Medical Malpractice Cases Where Expert Advice was Required to Learn Material Facts</TI>
<P>86. Finally, the respondents' situation differs significantly from the medical malpractice cases in which it was found that an expert opinion was required to provide the claimants with knowledge of material facts required to commence their claims.</P>
<P>87. First, in modern medical malpractice cases the Courts have recognized that, in some cases, a claimant will require advice from someone who is medically trained to assist him or her in discovering the <UNDER>material facts necessary</UNDER> to commence their claim. The Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> gives the example of a claimant who only discovered that she had not been an appropriate candidate for the cosmetic procedure she received and that the wrong instrument had been used to perform that procedure after receiving a College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario discipline decision regarding her doctor. The Court found that these were material facts necessary to commence her claim.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 21&ndash;26</P1></P>
<P>88. This differs from the respondents' case because the respondents do not allege they gained knowledge of additional <UNDER>material facts</UNDER> regarding the conduct or actions of the Crown Attorneys after receiving advice from their counsel. Instead, they gained legal knowledge. As noted above, ignorance or error with respect to the law has no bearing on discoverability and the receipt of leg al advice does not extend the limitation period <UNDER>when all the material facts were already known</UNDER> as they were in this case. It is for this reason that the fact that the respondents claim may be &ldquo;novel&rdquo; is a distinction without a difference.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3)</N><TI>THE MOTION JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF THE RESPONDENTS' FAILURE TO PURSUE THEIR CLAIM WITH DILIGENCE</TI>
<P>89. Finally, Ontario submits that Stinson J. also erred by failing to consider the effect of the respondents' admission in paragraph 50 of their claim that they did not retain counsel until several months after this Court's December 12, 2013 decision on Mr. Singh's appeal.</P>
<P>90. In <CASEREF><SOC>Longo v. McLaren Art Centre</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court stated that a claimant is required to act with due diligence in determining if he has a claim. A limitation period will not be tolled while a claimant sits idle and takes no steps to investigate the matters set out in section 5(1) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002</EM>, c 24, Schedule B at s. 5(1) and (2)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This includes acting with diligence in requesting an expert opinion.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Longo v. McLaren Art Centre</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 526</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities, Tab 20</P1>
<P1>See also <EM>Unegbu</EM> (S.C.J.), <EM>supra</EM> at paras, 12-13, (C.A.), <EM>supra</EM> at paras. 3 - 4</P1></P>
<P>91. The extent of the required action will depend on the circumstances of the case and a consideration of whether the claimant has acted reasonably; this includes an analysis of the nature of the potential claim as well as the particular circumstances of the claimant. In this case, the respondents, who are part of the justice system and are sophisticated, were clearly aggrieved by the conduct of the trial Crowns and knew the material facts necessary to commence their claim regarding their conduct before October 18, 2013. The respondents were clearly aggrieved by the conduct of the appellate Crown and knew all the material facts necessary to commence a claim regarding her conduct at the time the decision of this Court was released or shortly thereafter. Nevertheless, they waited several months after the appeal before even consulting legal counsel regarding a possible claim. This does not meet the diligence standard required of claimants.</P>
<P>92. The motion judge did not conduct any analysis with respect to the fact that the respondents clearly &ldquo;slept on their rights&rdquo;. Even if it were ultimately determined that the respondents' receipt of legal advice is a relevant factor given the &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; of the claim, the respondents failed to seek that advice with reasonable diligence. The failure of Stinson J. to consider this issue and apply the relevant law, even though it was before him, was an error. Further, the fact that the respondents failed to pursue their claim with diligence is a factor that should militate in favour of the Ontario with respect to the expiration of the limitation period.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">I. OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Appellant, Attorney General of Ontario (<BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD>), appeals the decision of the Honourable Justice Stinson dated January 4, 2017, in which His Honour dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike the claim of the Respondents on the basis of the expiry of the applicable limitation period.</P>
<P>2. The Attorney General's motion to strike the claim on the basis of the expiration of the applicable limitation period was one of three grounds that the Attorney General brought to strike the Respondents' Statement of Claim. The other two were:
<P1>i. That the action had failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action because Crown Attorneys are not liable to negligence or misfeasance in public office. They can have no liability to anyone other than a person they had prosecuted; and</P1>
<P1>ii. Allegations of negligence and misfeasance failed to plead the constituent elements of those torts and failed to plead the necessary material facts to support those causes of action.</P1></P>
<P>3. While Stinson J. bifurcated the Attorney General's motion to strike, in order to determine the Limitations issue first, the entire argument and the position of the Attorney General and the Respondents on all of the issues in the motion strike were before him, including, the Attorney General's position that the Respondents' claim in negligence was not just &ldquo;novel&rdquo;, but rather, it did not exist in law.</P>
<P>4. Therefore, this Appeal by the Attorney General on the limitations period issue raises the obvious question: How can the Attorney General argue that the Respondents should have had knowledge of the material facts to support their claim&mdash;a claim that the Attorney General argues does not exist in law? The obvious answer: it can't.</P>
<P>5. In addition, as important, the Ontario Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasized that limitations issues should not be determined in the absence of a complete factual record after pleadings have closed unless it is &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; from the Statement of Claim that the limitation period has expired. As Stinson J. correctly found, this case is a novel claim asserting a new kind of right, and the limitation issue involves legal and factual complexities regarding discoverability. For this reason, it is not plain and obvious that the limitation period expired.</P>
<P>6. The Attorney General seeks a determination on a defence which it has not pleaded (as no Statement of Defence has been filed) and in the absence of proper evidence on discoverability. A full hearing on the basis of a comprehensive evidentiary record is required to make a determination on the facts and the complex legal issues.</P>
<P>7. Consequently, it is respectfully submitted that the Attorney General's appeal should be dismissed.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">II. FACTS</TI>
<P>8. The Respondents to this motion rely on the Statement of Claim's more comprehensive version of facts, the most essential of which are provided below.</P>
<P>9. The Plaintiffs, Jamie Clark (<BOLD>&ldquo;Sgt. Clark&rdquo;</BOLD>), Donald Belanger (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Belanger&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Steven Watts (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Watts&rdquo;</BOLD>), (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Officers&rdquo;</BOLD> or <BOLD>&ldquo;Respondents&rdquo;</BOLD>), are police officers with the Toronto Police Service. They were members of the Hold-Up Squad at the relevant time.</P>
<P>10. In February of 2009, the Officers began investigating an armed robbery wherein the perpetrators brandished a firearm, zip-tied the victim, duct-taped his mouth and forcibly confined him while stealing approximately $389,000 of copper tubing.
<P1><BOLD>Officers' <UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER>, June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;<UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER>&rdquo;) at para. 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. On or about June 11, 2009, the officers arrested Neil Singh (<BOLD>&ldquo;Singh&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Randy Maharaj (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maharaj&rdquo;</BOLD>) in connection with the crime. Singh and Maharaj were charged with armed robbery, forceful confinement and conspiracy to commit both offences. On the night of the arrests, Singh provided a false exculpatory statement to the police. Maharaj confessed to involvement in the crime, which he said was perpetrated with Singh. Both statements were video recorded.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 9&ndash;11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Procedural History</EM></TI>
<P>12. During a June 12, 2009 bail hearing, counsel for Maharaj said that his client had suffered Injuries&mdash;bumps and scratches behind his ear&mdash;during the arrest. Counsel did not allege any assaultive conduct by the Officers and did not allege that there was an injury to Maharaj's rib.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 10&ndash;13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. At the preliminary hearing in the Ontario Court of Justice held between July and November 2010, the video statements were admitted into evidence, and voluntariness was not challenged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>It was not suggested that the statements should not be admitted on the basis that they were obtained under threats or as a product of oppressive circumstances.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> During the hearing, counsel for Maharaj suggested that his client had been assaulted during the arrest. The Officers were called as Crown witnesses. They gave evidence and vehemently denied the allegations of improper or assaultive conduct. The Crown did not suggest, at that time, that the Officers were committing perjury. Both accused were committed to stand trial in the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>14. At the trial, beginning November 28, 2011, Crown Attorney Sheila Cressman (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Cressman&rdquo;</BOLD>) had carriage of the prosecution. In advance of the trial, Maharaj's counsel brought an application to stay the proceedings and to exclude his confession, based on the doctrines of abuse of process and involuntariness. Maharaj alleged he was seriously beaten by police after his arrest but prior to the confession, and sustained a rib injury. Maharaj's counsel provided Ms. Cressman with an X-Ray purporting to support Marahaj's claim that he had a rib injury. He also provided the Crown with a transcript from the bail hearing. The Crown would have been aware of the allegations of mistreatment based on a review of the preliminary hearing transcript where the accusations were first made.</P>
<P>15. Ms. Cressman consulted Dr. Farley Moss (<BOLD>&ldquo;Dr. Moss&rdquo;</BOLD>) at Scarborough Centenary Hospital regarding the X-Ray. Dr. Moss confirmed the X-Ray showed a fractured rib, and said that this injury would cause excruciating pain if a person moved his upper arms or body. Dr. Moss said it was <BOLD><UNDER>possible</UNDER></BOLD> the rib injury occurred on the day of the arrest.</P>
<P>16. Ms. Cressman failed to take further obvious and appropriate steps to investigate Maharaj's allegation. In particular, Ms. Cressman:
<P1>(a) never asked Dr. Moss to review the video taped statement, in which Maharaj is seen making various movements with his arms that were incompatible with having a fresh rib injury;</P1>
<P1>(b) never asked Dr. Moss further questions regarding other potential time periods in which the injury could have occurred;</P1>
<P1>(c) never made inquiries of staff at Maplehurst Detention Centre (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maplehurst&rdquo;</BOLD>), where Maharaj was incarcerated during his trial, about Maharaj, even though she was in possession of Maharaj's medical records from the facility that showed no complaints about a rib injury any time after his arrest;</P1>
<P1>(d) did not properly review the transcripts of the bail hearing to understand the inconsistent injuries reported then as opposed to those reported at the time of the stay application; and</P1>
<P1>(e) did not seek further advice or comment from the Officers who had testified at the preliminary hearing and adamantly denied assaulting Maharaj.</P1></P>
<P>17. Despite her failure to take any steps to properly investigate the unsubstantiated allegation, Ms. Cressman, in consultation with senior Crown Attorney Frank Armstrong (<BOLD>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong&rdquo;</BOLD>), decided that Maharaj's statement would not be admissible because of involuntariness and therefore there would be no case against him. Mr. Armstrong did not direct Ms. Cressman or anyone else to conduct a further investigation into the allegation. The Crown decided to stay the charges against Maharaj on November 22, 2011.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 16&ndash;22 and 28.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Singh's trial commenced on November 28, 2011. Singh also sought to stay the proceedings against him on the basis of abusive police conduct. He falsely testified that he had been assaulted by the Officers. He relied on the purported mistreatment of Maharaj at the hands of the police to buttress his claim. On the ensuing application, Maharaj provided false evidence that he had been assaulted by the Officers.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 19.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Although aware that the Plaintiffs had previously testified under oath that they did not engage in any assaultive conduct and would testify to that effect if called as witnesses, Ms. Cressman called no evidence to challenge or contradict the false testimony. Rather, she essentially accepted that the alleged assaults occurred. She did so notwithstanding that she had assured Det. Sgt. Watt that he and the other Officers would be called as witnesses. However, after the first day of hearing, Ms. Cressman informed Det. Sgt. Watt she would not require the Officers' evidence. Though Det. Sgt. Watt expressed his concern to Ms. Cressman about how this decision would adversely affect the outcome of the case and findings that might be made against the Officers, Ms. Cressman would not change her position and the Officers were prevented from testifying.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 19&ndash;21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The Officers were not parties to the proceeding involving the Defendant and Singh and, to the knowledge of the Crown, had no standing to adduce evidence or make representations to the Court. The Officers relied on the Defendant to ensure that findings of illegal and improper conduct were not made against them in the absence of a full and complete record. Although the Crown could not control whether a Court might make those findings, the Crown could control whether the trial Court had all information relevant to the Officers' conduct given the potential for adverse findings against the Officers.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 20-21, 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. Ms. Cressman did not require Singh's counsel to prove the nature of the alleged assault, nor did she test the evidence in any way. She simply conceded that the assaultive conduct, as falsely alleged, had occurred and that there had been a serious <EM>Charter</EM> violation. Ms. Cressman knew at the time that doing so would have serious repercussions not only for the case she was prosecuting but for the Officers as well.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 22.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The judgment of Justice Thorburn was released on March 28, 2012. Singh had been convicted by a jury of armed robbery and forceful confinement. In the absence of any evidence from the Crown challenging the false testimony of Singh and Maharaj, Justice Thorburn made findings of fact that the Officers assaulted Singh and Maharaj exactly as alleged, which was described at length in the judgment. Though Justice Thorburn dismissed Singh's stay application, she reduced Singh's sentence because of the Officers' &ldquo;brutality&rdquo; and &ldquo;thoroughly reprehensible&rdquo; behaviour in the case.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 23-24.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. After Justice Thorburn's ruling was released, the Officers' reputations were irreparably harmed. Her findings were widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet.</P>
<P>24. Following the judgment, the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal notified the Chief of Police of their concerns about the Officers' conduct. The Special Investigations Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;SIU&rdquo;</BOLD>) invoked its mandate to conduct an investigation. However, Maharaj refused to be interviewed or to participate in the investigation, and the SIU withdrew its mandate in July 2012.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. After the SIU withdrew its mandate, the Toronto Police Service Professional Standards Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;TPSPS&rdquo;</BOLD>) conducted a comprehensive and independent review of the allegations of misconduct against the Officers. The investigators concluded that, based on an analysis of all the evidence, the allegations that the Officers used excessive force could not be substantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 30.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. In and around November 2012, the Crown Law Office was made aware of these new material facts that demonstrated the serious injustice that had been done to the Officers. The Crown took no action in response.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 31, 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Singh appealed the judgment. Before the appeal was argued, Det. Sgt. Watt met with Amy Alyea (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Alyea&rdquo;</BOLD>), who was going to argue the appeal on behalf of the Crown. He told Ms. Alyea that an egregious mistake had occurred. He advised Ms. Alyea of the results of the TPSPS report, of which she had a copy, and of Ms. Cressman's conduct.</P>
<P>28. Despite Det. Sgt. Watt's efforts, Ms. Alyea: (i) took no steps to investigate further, (ii) took no steps to rectify and repair the damage that had been done to the Officers' reputations, and (iii) took no steps to prepare and file an application to introduce fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal. During oral arguments in the appeal, the Court asked several questions about the Officers' behaviour, but Ms. Alyea never adequately advised the Court of the new material facts the Crown had learned or of the TPSPS's exculpatory findings regarding the Officers' conduct. Any attempt made by Ms. Alyea to alert the Court to the TPSPS findings or the substance of the report fell far below what was required in the circumstances. The report was not properly before the Court nor had it been properly disclosed to counsel for Mr. Singh.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 32-33, 35, 43 and 47.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal released its judgment, in which it granted the appellant's stay application. The Court condemned the &ldquo;egregious nature of the police misconduct,&rdquo; which it equated with &ldquo;torture.&rdquo; It found that the alleged abusive interrogation techniques were &ldquo;calculated, prolonged and skilfully choreographed.&rdquo; The Court stated that Crown counsel was unable to provide any details of the results of the TPSPS investigation. The Court adverted several times to the fact that the Defence's allegations were uncontradicted or uncontested by the Crown. The Court found the case for a stay more compelling because the allegations of &ldquo;serious criminal conduct&rdquo; by the police had gone unchallenged.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. The Court of Appeal's judgment was also widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet. Articles about the case repeated Singh's and Maharaj's false and defamatory allegations, and condemned the Officers' behaviour.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 36-37.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. Following the Court of Appeal judgment, the SIU re-opened their investigation. Maharaj agreed to be interviewed. The investigators reviewed all of the records and obtained opinion evidence. That investigation concluded that Maharaj's injury post-dated the time of arrest, and that his physical demeanour in the videotaped statement was inconsistent with his having sustained any rib injury at the time of arrest (during his video-recorded interview Maharaj is moving about in a way that would not have been possible had he suffered the cracked rib injury he alleged he had suffered at the hands of the Officers). The SIU found that the allegations by Maharaj were not substantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 38.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. Also following the Court of Appeal judgment, the Chief of the Toronto Police Service asked the Ontario Provincial Police (<BOLD>&ldquo;OPP&rdquo;</BOLD>) to conduct an independent review of the TPSPS investigation. The OPP review was conducted by an experienced, high-ranking investigator. On April 9, 2015, the OPP investigator concluded the TPSPS review had been thorough and she had no reason to refute its conclusions that the allegations of police misconduct were unsubstantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 39.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Respondents Commence an Action Against the Attorney General of Ontario</EM></TI>
<P>33. As alleged in the Respondents' Statement of Claim, several months after the Court of Appeal released its judgment, the Officers retained counsel. Counsel had the opportunity to review the entire record and listen to the audio of the oral arguments that were made in the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>34. After due consideration, counsel formed a legal opinion that they communicated to the Officers: the conduct of the Defendant may be tortious, and a novel claim in negligence and misfeasance in a public office could be pursued. It was only at this point that the Officers discovered that there was a viable claim, albeit a novel one.</P>
<P>35. The Respondents issued their Claim on June 22, 2016. In it, they claim as against the Attorney General damages for negligence and misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>36. In particular, the Claim alleges that Crown Attorneys owe a duty of care to investigating police officers and that this duty was breached through the conduct of Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea, and their superiors. The Claim also alleges that Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea and their superiors engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct that they knew to be inconsistent with their professional obligations, and that they did so in bad faith, with the knowledge that this misconduct would likely injure the Officers.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Attorney General's Motion to Strike</EM></TI>
<P>37. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 on the basis that:
<P1>(a) The action is statute-barred because the limitation period has expired: the Plaintiffs failed to commence it within two years of discovering the material facts on which the Claim is based. In particular, the Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Cressman by at least July 2012. The Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Alyea by at least December 12, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(b) The claims in negligence and misfeasance are not tenable at law. As Crown Attorneys do not owe a duty of care to investigating police officers, it is plain and obvious that the claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action in negligence and has no reasonable prospect of success. As the Attorney General states in its factum, &ldquo;[Aside from malicious prosecution,] no other action in tort is available against a Crown Attorney&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The claim in misfeasance is frivolous and vexations, as it did not provide full particulars to support this cause of action.</P1></P>
<P>38. Stinson J. bifurcated the motion, and heard arguments on the limitation issue first. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike on the basis of the limitation period argument by finding:
<P1>(a) Plaintiffs should not routinely be deprived of the opportunity to place a complete factual context before the court, by a defendant who asks the court to decide a limitation defence before it is pleaded;</P1>
<P1>(b) The exception to this rule is where it is plain and obvious from a review of a statement of claim that no additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a limitation period has expired;</P1>
<P1>(c) The exception will not apply where the case involves legal or factual complexities that bear on questions of discoverability and limitation periods;</P1>
<P1>(d) The central issue regarding the limitation period in this case involves s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, which provides that &ldquo;a claim is discovered on the earlier of, the day on which the person with the claim first knew... that, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(e) While generally, the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable Facts does not stop a limitation period from running, there is an arguable exception for novel claims, as was recognized by Low J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services</SOC></CASEREF>;</P1>
<P1>(f) As the Plaintiffs assert a novel claim, with &ldquo;a new kind of right,&rdquo; the exception is engaged in this case. Specifically, there is greater legal and factual complexity to the issue of discoverability, as it is not clear the Plaintiffs should have known that a civil remedy was appropriate before they obtained legal advice;</P1>
<P1>(g) It is not plain and obvious that the limitation issue will be decided against the Plaintiffs, and the issue should only be determined after a complete factual context is placed before the Court.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 43</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Clark</EM>&rdquo;), Responding Parties' Book of Authorities (&ldquo;Respondent's BOA&rdquo;), Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">III. ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>39. The sole issue to be determined on this appeal is whether appeal Stinson J. erred in dismissing the Attorney General's motion to strike the Respondents' claim on the basis that the applicable limitation period expired. It is the Respondents' position that he made no error in doing so.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Motion To Strike Based On A Limitation Period Is Not Available In This Particular Case</EM></TI>
<P>40. The Respondents respectfully submit that Stinson J. applied the correct and established legal principles to the facts of this case, and exercised his discretion appropriately.</P>
<P>41. Stinson J. correctly cited binding appellate authority from <CASEREF><SOC>Beardsley v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> for the proposition that, save in exceptional cases, courts do not entertain motions to decide limitation period issues prior to service of a statement of defence. The Court of Appeal in that case explained the principle underlying this policy:
<QUOTE><P>Plaintiffs would be deprived of the opportunity to place a complete factual context before the court if limitation defences were determined, on a routine basis, without being pleaded. Adherence to rules that ensure procedural fairness is an integral component of an appearance of justice. The appearance of justice takes on an even greater significance where claims are made against those who administer the law.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 13, citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Beardsley v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>57 O.R. (3d) 1</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Beardsley</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 22, Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. The Court stated that a motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period could only prevail in the exceptional instance where it is plain and obvious from the statement of claim that no additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a limitation period had expired.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 13, citing <EM>Beardsley</EM> at para. 21, Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. Stinson J. cited Brown J. to explain that this exception can only apply where the material facts are clear and applicable law is well-established:
<QUOTE><P>In <EM>Beardsley</EM> the possibility of bringing a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion before the close of pleadings was discussed in the context of a determination as to whether an action was statute-barred&mdash;for example, such as in cases where the injuries suffered in a car accident occurred on a date certain and nothing more can be said about that fact. That type of case is a far cry from the complex claim asserted in this proceeding.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 14, citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd v CUMIS General Insurance</SOC><CITE>[2010] O.J. No. 4736</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. The case at bar is also extremely complex, dealing in uncharted legal waters. As Stinson J. noted, the Ontario Court of Appeal has stated that the &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; exception set out in <EM>Beardsley</EM> must be confined to cases where there are no legal or factual complexities.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 15, citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Real Estate Association v. American Home Assurance Company</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 389</CITE><PARANUM>2</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. This Court had reason to revisit the &ldquo;exception principle&rdquo; set out in <EM>Beardsley</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, in the recent case of <CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>. The Respondents agree and adopt the summary of the factual matrix and underlying principles in <EM>Salweski</EM>, <EM>ibid</EM>, as summarized in paragraphs 43 to 48 of the Appellant's factum.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v. Lalonde</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 515 (CanLii)</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tab 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. What is most important is that this Court raises the bar even higher for a defendant who intends to rely on the <EM>Beardsley</EM> exception in context of a rule 21.01(a) motion to strike a claim based on the expiration of a limitation period BEFORE a Statement of Defence has been served and filed. As the Court states:
<QUOTE><P>Plaintiffs would be deprived of the opportunity to place a complete factual context before the court if limitation defences were determined, on a routine basis, without being pleaded. Adherence to rules that ensure procedural fairness is an integral component of an appearance of justice. The appearance of justice takes on an even greater significance where claims are made against those who administer the law.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para. 13, citing <EM>Beardsley</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 22, Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. In addition, and most applicable to the case at bar, this Court further stated that this <EM>Beardsley</EM> exception was never intended to &ldquo;apply in a situation such as this, where the fact situation is not straightforward and has not fully been defined by the pleadings, and where the Respondents seek to advance what may be a novel claim&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>, <BOLD><EM>supra</EM> at para. 46, Respondent's BOA, Tab 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>48. This Court applied the principle in the recent case of <CASEREF><SOC>Ridel v. Goldberg</SOC></CASEREF>. The sole issue is whether the motion judge erred in ruling on a rule 21.01(1)(a) motion that the action was barred by a two year limitation period. There is extensive argument before the Court with respect to knowledge and specifically, what the Appellants (Plaintiffs) knew or did not know in relation to the specific requirements as set out in section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>. The Court stated that is not appropriate because a more complete record was required to permit the Court to determine the issues raised by the parties on the appeal:
<QUOTE><P>In our view, it would not be appropriate for this court to rule on the issues raised by the parties on the limited record that is before us. As indicated, this was a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion. We have only the pleadings. There is no evidence before the court concerning what has become the main focus of the appellants' submission, namely, the relationship between e3m and Goldberg and the control he is alleged to have exercised over e3m in relation to the claim advanced by the appellants. Nor is the record adequate to permit us to properly consider the application of <EM>Indcondo</EM> in the specific context of the facts of this case.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ridel v. Goldberg</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 739 (CanLii)</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>49. Finally, in the recent case of <CASEREF><SOC>Sicilian Maceri Services v. OGO Fibers Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, a motion was brought under rule 21.01(1)(a) to strike a Statement of Claim that had been issued in 2017 to enforce a 2014 judgment of the Italian Court. The Defendants, like the Appellants in this case, argued that there was no need to file a Statement of Defence, that it was plain and obvious from a review of the Statement of Claim that no additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a limitation period had expired. Fragomeni J. disagreed, reviewing the principles set out in <EM>Beardsley</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, and <CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, he found that if he granted the motion, it would deprive the plaintiff from introducing facts in response to a limitation defense that could move the expiry date of the limitation period, and that the plaintiff would have an opportunity to introduce facts that could impact on the Court fixing the appropriate date from which the limitation period should commence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sicilian Maceri Services v. OGO Fibers Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1342 (CanLii)</CITE><PARANUM>17-18</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tab 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. There is no onus on the Respondents to articulate what facts could be pleaded, that would alter the conclusion that the limitation period expired. As this Court reiterated in <CASEREF><SOC>Salewski v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM> and <CASEREF><SOC>Ridel v. Goldberg</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, and as Fragomeni J. reiterated in <CASEREF><SOC>Sicilian Maceri Services v. OGO Fibers Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, a complete record is necessary, i.e.: Statement of Defence and Reply pleading to permit a court to determine the issues surrounding the expiration of a limitation period. That record is not present in this case, and therefore it is not plain and obvious that the limitation period had expired before the claim was commenced, and as such, there is a genuine issue of discoverability still to be determined.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Motion Judge Did Not Err In Finding There Is An Exception To The Discoverability Rule For &ldquo;Novel&rdquo; Claims</EM></TI>
<P>51. Stinson J. was correct in finding that a novel claim may provide an exception to the general rule that failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop a limitation period from running.</P>
<P>52. Generally, the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop the limitation period from running. However, as Stinson J. recognized, there is an arguable exception for <UNDER>novel claims</UNDER>. In <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services</SOC></CASEREF>, Low J. stated:
<QUOTE><P>Section 5(1)(a)(iv) does not import an idiosyncratic period calibrated by the claimant's familiarity with or ignorance of the law. The test is an objective one. <UNDER>While it is possible to envisage that a new kind of right might arise that has not been hitherto protected, thus making it arguable that a civil proceeding might not be seen objectively as an appropriate means to seek to remedy</UNDER>, a battery causing personal injury is a classic example of the kind of wrong that is appropriate for redress by court action. A citizen is presumed to know the law of the land.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 18, citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Boyce v. Toronto (City) Police Services</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 53</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Boyce</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 23, Respondent's BOA, Tabs 1 and 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>53. The case at bar meets this exception. The Statement of Claim asserts a novel claim, involving new kinds of rights, with complex legal intricacies that have not yet been recognized by courts. The Claim alleges that courts <UNDER>should</UNDER> recognize that Crown Attorneys owe a duty of care to police officers who are engaged as participants and witnesses in the criminal justice process. On this basis, Stinson J. found that the exception for novel claims posited by Low J. in <EM>Boyce</EM> was engaged in the case at bar.</P>
<P>54. As the Respondents assert a novel claim&mdash;one that has not yet been recognized in law&mdash;they could not have known that a civil remedy was appropriate before they obtained legal advice. The Plaintiffs may have known the underlying facts, but these facts were not &ldquo;discoverable&rdquo; in the sense that is intended by s. 5(1)(a)(iv)&mdash;that the nature of the injury they experienced was such that they would know a legal proceeding would be an appropriate remedy. For this reason, the Plaintiffs assert that the limitation period did not commence until <UNDER>after</UNDER> they obtained legal advice.</P>
<P>55. This case bears some similarity to medical malpractice cases in which plaintiffs are not presumed to know the legal concepts pertaining to the requisite standard of care. In those cases, courts have held there are times when the underlying facts of treatment and loss have occurred but are not discoverable by a layperson because of their technical complexity. Instead, the limitation period did not start until the plaintiffs received advice from another medical practitioner or legal counsel.

<P>56. Indeed, the case at bar presents a stronger argument that the limitation period did not commence until the Plaintiffs had obtained legal advice. In the medical malpractice cases, there was a recognized duty of care and claim for negligence; only a determination of whether the standard of care had been breached was required. In this case, a novel claim is being asserted: as yet, the right that is claimed has not been recognized in law.</P>
<P>57. In <CASEREF><SOC>Unegbu v WFG Securities of Canada Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, the fact that the claimant's claims were recognized at law and there were no legal complexities (such as whether a professional standard of care was met) <UNDER>means</UNDER> &ldquo;there was no need for any advice of a technical nature to inform her that she had a cause of action.&rdquo; The Court held that the plaintiff could not rely on her ignorance of the law to postpone the commencement of the limitation period. This applies only to claims that are recognized at law, for a claimant can be neither ignorant nor imputed with knowledge of a cause of action that does not yet exist.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Unegbu v. WFG Securities of Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2015] O.J. No. 5682</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's BOA, Tab 14.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. <CASEREF><SOC>Nicholas v. McCarthy Tetrault</SOC></CASEREF> and <EM>Lawless</EM> also concerned claims that are recognized at law. In both, the Court of Appeal specifically addressed occasions where claimants may need technical advice before material facts are discoverable. In <CASEREF><SOC>Nicholas v. McCarthy Tetrault</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court agreed with the motions judge but said,
<QUOTE><P>We would only add that at the very least, when the appellant signed the Settlement Agreement with her husband on January 22, 1997, <UNDER>with the benefit of legal advice from her new counsel</UNDER>, she knew or ought to have known of all the material facts giving rise to the impugned claim against the respondents.</P></QUOTE>

<P>59. In <EM>Lawless</EM>, the Court of Appeal gave the definition of &ldquo;cause of action&rdquo; as &ldquo;the fact or facts which give a person a right to judicial redress or relief against another.&rdquo; This definition accords with Stinson J.'s focus on s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, which ties discoverability to the plaintiff's knowledge that a legal proceeding would be an appropriate means of redress for an injury. The Attorney General does not explain how the cases it cites are authority for the proposition that the Respondents in the case at bar discovered the material facts upon their occurrence, when they could not have known they had a right to judicial redress before getting legal advice. Instead, it merely asserts that, &ldquo;the key point established by these cases is that the fact that a claimant does not know they have a <UNDER>recognized cause of action</UNDER> does not operate to toll the limitation period&rdquo;&mdash;an assertion with which the Respondents agree.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Lawless</EM> at para. 22, Respondent's BOA, Tab 13;</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Moving Party's Factum at para. 77.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Novelty of the Claim Bears on Discoverability</EM></TI>
<P>60. The Respondents do not dispute that liability or culpability is determined through the trial process. The questions posed by the case at bar are whether a new <EM>basis</EM> for liability or culpability should be recognized at law, and whether such a novel claim could be discovered before the claimants obtained a legal opinion. <CASEREF><SOC>Lochner v. Toronto (City) Police Services Board</SOC></CASEREF>, as referenced in the Attorney General's factum, has no relevance to these issues.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lochner v. Toronto (City) Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 626</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Lochner</EM>&rdquo;), Book of Authorities of the Appellant, Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. At paragraph 77 of its factum, the Attorney General argues that, &ldquo;although these decisions do not specifically deal with the concept of the receipt of legal advice in relation to a cause of action which has not previously been recognized, the distinction is immaterial.&rdquo; Yet, the Attorney General makes no attempt to explain <UNDER>why</UNDER> the distinction is immaterial, or how a claimant can be imputed with knowledge of a cause of action when the claim it relates to has not been recognized at law.</P>
<P>62. The Respondents did believe a wrong had been done by the Crown Attorneys' egregious behaviour. But they did not know&mdash;and crucially, <EM>could not have known</EM>&mdash;that a legal proceeding was an appropriate means to seek to remedy that wrong because there was no recognized claim at law for the injury.</P>
<P>63. The Respondents' &ldquo;sophistication&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge of the law&rdquo; is precisely what informed their belief that they did not have a right that could be vindicated through a legal proceeding, as they were familiar with the concept of Crown immunity in its prosecutorial duties. In any event, the Respondents' familiarity with the law pertained to police investigations and criminal prosecutions. They have no relative sophistication in novel claims in tort. For this reason, they required legal advice before discovering the material facts of their claim.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Motion Judge Did Not Err In Failing To Consider The Effect Of The Respondents' Failure To Pursue Their Claim With Diligence</EM></TI>
<P>64. The Attorney General has taken a double barrel approach at the motion to strike the Plaintiffs' claim. On the one hand, the Attorney General argues that the claim that the Respondents are bringing amounts to no reasonable cause of action, and indeed argues that there is no such claim in law. At the same time, the Attorney General argues that the Respondents did not act with due diligence in starting an action with respect to a claim that the Attorney General argues does not even exist in law.</P>
<P>65. The Attorney General's double barreled attempts to strike the claim cannot be reconciled. The novelty of the claim and the complexity of the legal and factual issues clearly have a bearing on the limitation period, i.e.: the Respondents could not have known there was a cause of action of a novel claim until after they had obtained legal advice.</P>
<P>66. If the material facts were not discoverable until after the Respondents obtained legal advice, then their diligence in pursuing their claim should be measured from the time they received that advice. Determining whether they were diligent at that point requires an evidentiary record.</P>
<P>67. It is submitted that this fact alone is enough for this Court to dismiss the Attorney General's appeal on the issue of whether the limitation period has expired. However, even if the material facts were discoverable earlier, it is not clear why waiting several months would necessarily imply the Respondents did not act diligently. As the Attorney General again points out at paragraph 82, the Respondents &ldquo;are part of the justice system and are sophisticated.&rdquo; This &ldquo;sophistication&rdquo; and familiarity with Crown immunity may have suppressed or delayed their intention to investigate further. What is clear is that a comprehensive factual record is needed to determine this issue.</P>
<P>68. Whether the Respondents acted diligently in pursuing their claim is a question of fact or of mixed fact and law that can only be determined on the basis of an extensive evidentiary record. In this proceeding, there is no evidentiary record&mdash;indeed, there is not even a statement of defence&mdash;substantiating the assertion that the Respondents did not act diligently and &ldquo;slept on their rights.&rdquo; That allegation would have to be set out in the Statement of Defence and cannot be determined before pleadings have closed, if relevant at all.

<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> the Attorney General of Ontario (hereafter, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD>), appeals to the Divisional Court from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson, dated January 4, 2017, made in Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the judgment be set aside and an Order be made:</P>
<P>1. Allowing the Appellant's motion to strike out and dismiss the Respondents' Statement of Claim on the basis that it is statute-barred by section 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act 2002</EM>, S.O. 2002, c 2 4, Sch. B;</P>
<P>2. The costs of the appeal; and,</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Claim</TI>
<P>1. The Respondents, officers with the Toronto Police Service, commenced the underlying action alleging negligence and misfeasance against the Attorney General for the alleged conduct of two Assistant Crown Attorneys and one appellate Crown Counsel in the course of the criminal prosecution of Randy Maharaj and Neil Singh for armed robbery.</P>
<P>2. The Respondents, who conducted the investigation which led to the prosecution, allege that the prosecutors were negligent or acted deliberately in failing to rebut allegations by the accused individuals that the Respondents assaulted them following their arrest.</P>
<P>3. Prosecutors obtained a stay of the charges against Mr. Maharaj in November 2011, but proceeded against Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh was convicted, but received a reduced sentence in July 2012 due to the alleged conduct of the Respondents.</P>
<P>4. The Superior Court issued decisions which were critical of the Respondents' conduct on March 28, 2012 and July 27, 2012. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal overturned Mr. Singh's conviction on the basis of the alleged abuse and issued reasons critical of the Respondents. These decisions, including the criticism of the Respondents, were the subject of contemporaneous media coverage.</P>
<P>5. On June 22, 2016, the Respondents commenced this action against the Attorney General by issuing the Statement of Claim (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>6. The Respondents Claim admits that they knew the salient material facts relating to their claim against the trial Crown Attorneys prior to the argument of Mr. Singh's appeal on October 18, 2013. The Claim also suggests the Respondents knew the material facts relating to the claim against the appellate Crown counsel on, or around, December 12, 2013. Finally, the Claim states that the Respondents waited several months after the Court of Appeal released its decision on December 12, 2013 before seeking legal advice regarding their claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The motion to strike</TI>
<P>7. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim on the basis that it was plain and obvious that it is statute-barred pursuant to s. 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> because it was commenced more than two years after the respondents discovered the material facts on which the Claim is based.</P>
<P>8. The Attorney General also moved to strike the claim because it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. The motion was bifurcated and the limitations issue was heard on October 25, 2016 before the Honourable Justice Stinson (the <BOLD>&ldquo;motion judge&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>9. On the limitation issue, the Attorney General asserted that it was plain and obvious that the respondents were aware of the material facts giving rise to the Claim in relation to the Assistant Crown Attorneys at trial by July 2012, the date of the last trial ruling.</P>
<P>10. The Attorney General argued that the Respondents were aware of the material facts giving rise to the Claim as against the appellate Crown Counsel by December 12, 2013, the date of the Court of Appeal's ruling.</P>
<P>11. While the Respondents served notice of their intention to commence a claim against the Attorney General on October 20, 2015, they did not commence the Claim until June 22, 2016, almost four years after the last trial decision, in July 2012, and more than two years and six months after the Court of Appeal's decision, in December 2013.</P>
<P>12. In response to the motion, the Respondents asserted that the matter could not be resolved on a Rule 21 motion because the Claim raised live factual issues regarding the limitation period. In particular, the Respondents asserted that they did not know that a lawsuit was the appropriate means to seek a remedy, an element of discoverability under section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, until they met with counsel &ldquo;several months after&rdquo; the release of the Court of Appeal's decision and &ldquo;discovered their cause of action&rdquo;. They also argued that they required legal advice to discover their claim because it was &ldquo;novel&rdquo;, although this is not pleaded in the Claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge</TI>
<P>13. On January 4, 2017, the motion judge released his decision dismissing the Attorney General's motion on the limitations issue. The motion judge held that the action was not one of the exceptional cases in which a limitations issue could be decided on a Rule 21 motion because the underlying issues in the action were factually and/or legally complex.</P>
<P>14. The motion judge held that although, generally, &ldquo;the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not stop a limitation period from running&rdquo; an exception exists where a plaintiff is asserting a novel cause of action.</P>
<P>15. Based on the recognition of this exception, the motion judge held that because the Respondents are asserting a new kind of right&mdash;i.e. the existence of a duty of care owed by prosecutors to investigating police officers&mdash;it was inappropriate to determine in a Rule 21 motion the question of whether the Respondents should have known that a lawsuit was an appropriate means to seek a remedy before they obtained legal advice.</P>
<P>16. The motion judge did not address the admission by the Respondents in the Claim that they did not seek legal advice until several months after the release of the Court of Appeal's decision.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Honourable Motion Judge Erred</TI>
<P>17. Stinson J. erred in law by:
<P1>i. Failing to apply the proper legal test on a motion to strike based on the expiry, of a limitation period before a statement of defence is filed;</P1>
<P1>ii. Finding that there is an exception to the general rule that discoverability is dependent on when a claimant knew the material facts necessary to commence an action, and not when that claimant received legal advice regarding the legal significance of those facts, where the claim asserted is &ldquo;novel&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>iii. Finding that a motion to strike based on an expired limitation period should not be granted where underlying issues in the action, not related to the limitations issue, are factually or legally complex;</P1>
<P1>iv. Misapplying and misinterpreting <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. V. CUMIS General Insurance</SOC><YEAR>2010</YEAR><CITE>104 O.R. (3d) 16</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, which did not deal with a motion to strike on the basis of a limitation period; and</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> the Attorney General of Ontario (hereafter, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD>), appeals to the Divisional Court from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson, dated June 13, 2017, made in Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the judgment be set aside and an Order be made:</P>
<P>1. Allowing the Appellant's motion to strike out and dismiss the Respondents' allegations of misfeasance in public office for the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action and for the failure to plead the constituent elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office;</P>
<P>2. The costs of the appeal; and,</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Claim</TI>
<P>1. The Respondents, officers with the Toronto Police Service, commenced the underlying action alleging negligence and misfeasance in public office (&ldquo;misfeasance&rdquo;) against the Attorney General for the alleged conduct of two Assistant Crown Attorneys and one appellate Crown Counsel in the course of the criminal prosecution of Randy Maharaj and Neil Singh for armed robbery.</P>
<P>2. The Respondents, who conducted the investigation which led to the prosecution, allege that the prosecutors were negligent or acted deliberately in failing to rebut allegations by Mr. Singh and Mr. Maharaj that the Respondents had assaulted them following their arrest.</P>
<P>3. Prosecutors obtained a stay of the charges against Mr. Maharaj in November 2011, but proceeded against Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh was convicted, but received a reduced sentence in July 2012 due to the alleged conduct of the Respondents.</P>
<P>4. The Superior Court issued decisions in the criminal proceedings which were critical of the Respondents' conduct on March 28, 2012 and July 27, 2012. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal overturned Mr. Singh's conviction on the basis of the alleged abuse and issued reasons critical of the Respondents. These decisions, including the criticism of the Respondents, were the subject of contemporaneous media coverage.</P>
<P>5. On June 22, 2016, the Respondents commenced this action against the Attorney General by issuing the Claim.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The motion to strike</TI>
<P>6. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim on the basis that it is statute-barred pursuant to s. 4 of the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM> because it was commenced more than two years after the Respondents discovered the material facts on which the Claim is based.</P>
<P>7. The Attorney General also moved to strike the claim on the basis that it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action because Crown Attorneys are not liable for negligence and misfeasance, particularly with respect to the Respondents in this matter (investigating police officers). Stinson J. bifurcated the motion and the limitations issue was heard on October 25, 2016.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge on the limitations issue</TI>
<P>8. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision dismissing the Attorney General's motion on the limitations issue. He held that the action was not one of the exceptional cases in which a limitations issue could be decided on a Rule 21 motion because the underlying issues in the action were factually and/or legally complex. He further held that because the claim was novel, it could not have been discovered until the Respondents sought legal advice.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The motion to strike on the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action issue</TI>
<P>9. On this portion of the motion, the Attorney General took the position that there was no cause of action against a Crown Attorney in negligence or misfeasance based on the quartet of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with Crown Attorney liability (<CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 170</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec</SOC><CITE>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 9</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC><CITE>[2009] 3 S.C.R. 339</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>[2015] 2 S.C.R. 214</CITE></CASEREF>) and the dicta of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <CASEREF><SOC>Thomson v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1998] O.J. No. 3917</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC><YEAR>2005</YEAR><CITE>205 O.A.C. 188</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Miguna v. Ontario</SOC><YEAR>2005</YEAR><CITE>205 O.A.C. 257</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 5566</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>10. Alternatively, with respect to the negligence allegations, the Crown argued there was no duty of care owed by Crown Attorneys to investigating police officers because there was no proximity and residual policy considerations negated a duty of care.</P>
<P>11. Alternatively, with respect to the misfeasance allegations, the Attorney General argued that courts are loath to review the discretionary and tactical decisions made by Crown Attorneys in the criminal context short of flagrant impropriety and the civil court should be equally or more loath to do so in the civil context.</P>
<P>12. Further, the Attorney General argued that the residual policy considerations negating a duty of care in negligence also negate the imposition of liability for misfeasance, particularly in a case such as this, where the Respondents were not the subjects of the prosecution.</P>
<P>13. Finally, Ontario argued that the pleadings with respect to negligence and misfeasance were bald and otherwise did not conform to the rules of pleading.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>The decision of the motion judge on the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action issue</TI>
<P>14. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. issued his decision on the part of the motion to strike based on the failure to. disclose a reasonable cause of action. Stinson J. struck the allegations in negligence, but allowed the action to continue with respect to some of the allegations of misfeasance.</P>
<P>15. Stinson J. found that the claim in misfeasance was different from the claim in negligence because misfeasance was a recognized cause of action, whereas the negligence claim was an attempt to extend the liability of Crown Attorneys to a new sphere. As a result, he held that his analysis would be different, and would be limited to a review of the claim to determine whether it contains sufficient allegations that, if proven, would establish the cause of action.</P>
<P>16. Stinson J. found that the ability of the criminal court to review the discretionary and tactical decisions of a prosecutor was not as circumscribed as the Attorney General argued and was not a basis to find that the claim in misfeasance was untenable. He further found that the allegations in the statement of claim, if proven, could give rise to liability in misfeasance. With respect to the existence of an unlawful act, a required element in a claim for misfeasance, Stinson J. agreed with the Respondents that a breach of the Crown Attorney's duties and oath of office under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990 c. C.49 could qualify.</P>
<P>17. In arriving at his decision on misfeasance, Stinson J. did not conduct any analysis with respect to the policy considerations regarding the expansion of Crown Attorney liability set out in <EM>Nelles</EM> or <EM>Henry</EM> on which he relied to strike the negligence claim. Stinson J. made no finding as to whether those policy considerations had any bearing on his decision to expand Crown Attorney liability to include claims in misfeasance. Stinson J. allowed the claim for misfeasance in public office to continue in respect of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct absent any allegations of malice, which the Courts have consistently required to establish liability in all cases alleging civil liability for non<EM>-Charter</EM> claims for damages.</P>
<P>18. In deciding the motion, Stinson J. refused to consider any documents incorporated by reference into the Claim, or conduct any analysis of the law which permits the consideration of such evidence on a Rule 21 motion.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Honourable Motion Judge Erred</TI>
<P>19. Stinson J. erred in law by:
<P1>i) Declining to consider the documents incorporated by reference in the statement of claim in deciding the motion, even though the consideration of such evidence is permissible on a Rule 21 motion;</P1>
<P1>ii) Finding that the Supreme Court quartet and the Court of Appeal decisions in <EM>Thomson, Gilbert, Miguna</EM> and <EM>Brummell</EM> were not dispositive of the issues on the motion;</P1>
<P1>iii) Finding that the misfeasance claim differed from the negligence claim in that it was a recognized cause of action against Crown Attorneys and therefore required a different analysis;</P1>
<P1>iv) Failing to analyze the policy considerations set out in <EM>Nelles</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM> regarding the expansion of the Crown Attorney liability in the context of the claim for misfeasance;</P1>
<P1>v) Relying on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2016] O.J. No. 6163</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, when this Court found that there is good reason to doubt the correctness of that decision and granted leave to appeal (<CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2017] O.J. No. 2370</CITE></CASEREF>); and,</P1>
<P1>vi) Failing to find that the elements of the cause of action of misfeasance were not properly pleaded in the claim, and failing to strike a non<EM>-Charter</EM> claim for damages alleging prosecutorial misconduct absent allegations of malice.</P1></P>

<P>20. Rules 21, 25 and 62.02 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg 194;</P>

<P1>ii. The Order of the Honourable Justice Stinson regarding the misfeasance allegations dated June 13, 2017 is interlocutory; and</P1>

<P>Counsel for the Appellant, Attorney General of Ontario</P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This is an appeal by the Attorney General for Ontario (Ontario) from the June 13, 2017 decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Stinson which dismissed, in part, Ontario's motion to strike out the respondents' statement of claim and dismiss the respondents' action for the failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action. Stinson J. struck the respondents' allegations in negligence, but allowed the respondents' allegations in misfeasance in public office to proceed. Ontario submits that Stinson J. erred in permitting the allegations in misfeasance to proceed and the appeal should be granted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>On March 7, 2018, this Court ordered that this appeal be heard at the same time as Ontario's appeal from the January 4, 2017 decision of Stinson J. which dismissed Ontario's motion to strike out the respondents' action as being statute -barred, and the respondents' appeal from the dismissal of their allegations in negligence arising from Stinson J.'s June 13, 2017 decision.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. The respondents are police officers with the Toronto Police Service (TPS) and were the investigating police officers with respect to a complaint of armed robbery and forcible confinement which took place in 2009. Two individuals were charged. The Deputy Crown Attorney and Assistant Crown Attorney (Crowns) assigned to the prosecutions stayed the charges against one of the accused (Mr. Maharaj) because he alleged that his confession was involuntary as a result of an assault by two of the respondents. The other accused (Mr. Singh) was convicted, but his sentence was reduced when the trial judge found that he had also been assaulted by one of the respondents while another stood by and did not intervene. The trial Crowns exercised their prosecutorial discretion not to challenge the allegations of assault and not to call the respondents to testify at Mr. Singh's trial.</P>
<P>3. Subsequent to the trial, the Professional Standards Unit of the Toronto Police Service (PSU) investigated the complaints of assault. Neither Mr. Singh or Mr. Maharaj, nor the respondents, agreed to be interviewed as part of the investigation. The PSU found that the allegations of assault could not be substantiated. At the appeal of Mr. Singh's conviction, Crown counsel with carriage of the appeal advised this Court of the existence of the review by the PSU, but the Court declined to consider it. This Court found that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay Mr. Singh's conviction due to the conduct of the respondents and his conviction was overturned.</P>
<P>4. The respondents later commenced an action alleging that Ontario is liable to them in negligence and misfeasance in public office because of the conduct of the three Crowns with carriage of the prosecutions and appeal. The respondents allege that the Crowns were negligent and misfeasant in failing to further investigate the claims of assault and for not calling evidence (including their testimony) to refute the allegations. They further allege that the appellate Crown should have brought a fresh evidence application to file the PSU report with this Court on Mr. Singh's appeal.</P>
<P>5. Ontario moved to strike the action on the basis that the action was statute-barred and because the action failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action in that Crown Attorneys are not liable in negligence or misfeasance in public office, and the Claim failed to properly plead the constituent elements of negligence or misfeasance,</P>
<P>6. Stinson J. bifurcated Ontario's motion and decided the limitations issue first. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. dismissed Ontario's motion on the limitations issue. The balance of Ontario's motion to strike was heard on February 21 and 22, 2017. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. allowed the motion in part, striking the allegations in negligence, but allowing the misfeasance allegations to proceed.</P>
<P>7. Ontario's appeal with respect to the misfeasance allegations should be granted because Stinson J. erred:
<P1>i) In finding that misfeasance in public office is a viable cause of action arising from the conduct of a Crown Attorney;</P1>
<P1>ii) In failing to conduct any analysis regarding the policy reasons militating against the expansion of Crown Attorney liability set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF> in the context of the misfeasance claim;</P1>
<P1>iii) In finding that the claim in misfeasance had been properly pleaded and, particularly, in failing to conduct any analysis of the alleged &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; which are required to establish the tort.</P1>
<P1>iv) Relying on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, when the Divisional Court granted leave to appeal that decision on the basis that there was good reason to doubt its correctness<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The decision of the motion judge in <EM>Smith</EM> was overturned by the Divisional Court on February 21, 2018 (<CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 993</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities Tab 20).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>; and,</P1>
<P1>v) Declining to consider the documents incorporated by reference in the statement of claim in deciding the motion, even though the consideration of such evidence is permissible on Rule 21 and Rule 25 motions.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>On a motion to strike, and any appeal therefrom, the Court must assume that the facts pleaded in the Claim are true. The facts pleaded may be disputed should the action proceed.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION GIVING RISE TO THE ACTION</TI>
<P>8. The respondents investigated an armed robbery which took place in February 2009. On June 11, 2009, the respondents arrested Neil Singh and Randy Maharaj. Mr. Singh was interviewed and provided an exculpatory statement to the respondents Mr. Watts and Mr. Clark. Mr. Maharaj confessed to the crime to the respondents Mr. Watts and Mr. Belanger.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 7&ndash;9, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Attorney General (Appeal Book), Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>9. At his bail hearing on June 12, 2009, Mr. Maharaj's lawyer put on the record that his client had been injured during his arrest and had very visible bumps and scratches.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 10, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>10. The preliminary hearing for both accused was held between July 16, 2010 and November 9, 2010. The respondents were called as witnesses. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj questioned the respondents about his client's accusations of being assaulted (kicked in the head and beaten) during his arrest. They denied the assault. Mr. Singh and Mr. Maharaj were committed to stand trial.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 11, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>11. The trial commenced on November 28, 2011. Deputy Crown Attorney Sheila Cressman had carriage of the prosecution. In advance of the trial, counsel for Mr. Maharaj brought an application to stay the proceedings against him and to exclude his confession, relying on doctrines of abuse of process and voluntariness based on the allegation that he was assaulted by two of the respondents prior to his confession.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 13, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>12. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj advised Ms. Cressman that Mr. Maharaj received a serious rib injury due to an alleged assault by police after his arrest and before he gave his statement. Mr. Maharaj does not appear to have complained about this specific issue when he was admitted to Maplehurst Correctional Centre (Maplehurst) prior to trial. Counsel for Mr. Maharaj provided Ms. Cressman with a CD containing an X-ray purporting to support his allegations. Ms. Cressman spoke to Dr. Moss, a doctor at the hospital where Mr. Maharaj had been treated, who advised her that he had viewed the X-rays with a thoracic surgeon and that it was possible that the injuries could have occurred on the day of Mr. Maharaj's arrest. Dr. Moss also advised that such an injury could result in pain if a person were to move their arms or upper body. In his videotaped statements, Mr. Maharaj is seen moving his arms. Ms. Cressman did not seek Dr. Moss' opinion regarding whether the movements on the video were consistent with the injury having occurred on the day of the arrest.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 13&ndash;17, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>13. Ms. Cressman consulted with senior Assistant Crown Attorney Frank Armstrong, who agreed with her that Mr. Maharaj's statement would not be admissible as it could not be proven to be voluntary due to all of the injuries he allegedly suffered. As a result, on November 22, 2011, Mr. Armstrong stayed the charges against Mr. Maharaj.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 18, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>14. On November 28, 2012, the trial of Mr. Singh proceeded before the Honourable Madam Justice Thorburn. Mr. Singh was convicted of armed robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement. Mr. Singh's counsel brought a <EM>Charter</EM> application to stay the conviction, relying on the evidence of his client and that of Mr. Maharaj. Mr. Maharaj testified he had been assaulted by the respondents Mr. Belanger and Mr. Clark. Mr. Singh testified that he had been assaulted by Mr. Clark while Mr. Watts stood by and did not intervene. In the Claim, the respondents allege that the testimony of Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh was false.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 19, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Judgment, Thorburn J., <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC><PARANUM>1-2</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Matthew Howe, sworn September 19, 2016 (Howe Affidavit), Appeal Book, Tab 14D</P1></P>
<P>15. Ms. Cressman determined that she would not call any evidence in response to the allegations. She advised the Court that the evidence demonstrated that whatever happened to Mr. Singh was not as extreme as he suggested, but that the evidence did meet the low threshold required to establish a <EM>Charter</EM> breach. She suggested the proper remedy was not a stay of proceedings, but a reduction of sentence.
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 21 - 22, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Transcript, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, March 27, 2012, at p. 92, Exhibit C to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14C</P1></P>
<P>16. On March 28, 2012, Thorburn J. dismissed Mr. Singh's stay application. Thorburn J. noted that the evidence of the accused had not been contradicted and found that while a stay was not warranted, Mr. Singh's sentence should be reduced due to the assault he suffered at the hands of the respondents.
<P1>Judgment, Thorburn J., <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC><PARANUM>46&ndash;51</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Exhibit D to the Howe Affidavit, Tab 14D</P1>
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 23-24, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>17. Mr. Singh appealed his conviction and sentence. Before the appeal was heard, the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal notified the Chief of the TPS about concerns regarding the respondents' conduct. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) was notified and invoked its mandate. However, Mr. Maharaj refused to be interviewed or participate in the investigation and the SIU withdrew its mandate. However, between July 4, 2012 and October 31, 2012, the PSU conducted a review of the allegations of misconduct and use of excessive force. In a written report, the PSU concluded the use of excessive force &ldquo;could not be substantiated&rdquo;. Neither Mr. Singh or Mr. Maharaj, nor the respondents, were interviewed as part of the PSU investigation.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 30, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Toronto Police Service Court Review, dated October 31, 2012, Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14F</P1></P>
<P>18. The Claim alleges that prior to the argument of Mr. Singh's appeal, the respondent Mr. Watt spoke to appellate Crown counsel Amy Alyea and advised her that an &ldquo;egregious mistake had occurred&rdquo;. The Claim states he also advised her about, <EM>inter alia</EM>, what the respondents had learned about Ms. Cressman's alleged failure to investigate the allegations of assault and the contents of the PSU report.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 32, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>19. Neither the respondents nor the Toronto Police Association moved to intervene in the appeal of Mr. Singh's conviction.
<P1>Judgment, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, Ontario Court of Appeal, dated December 13, 2013, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Appeal Book, Tab 14H</P1></P>
<P>20. On December 12, 2013, this Court released its decision staying Mr. Singh's conviction, finding that he was a victim of conduct &ldquo;which might well be characterized as torture&rdquo; at the hands of the respondent Mr. Clark. In the Claim, the respondents allege that this was a result of the failure of the Crowns to apprise the Court of the &ldquo;new material facts that established that Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh had most certainly fabricated the allegations of assault by the officers&rdquo;. Articles regarding the decision appeared in the media on December 12 and 13, 2013.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 35&ndash;37, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Judgment, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Singh</SOC></CASEREF>, December 12, 2013 at pg. 16, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Tab 14 H</P1>
<P1>Newspaper Articles, Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Tabs 14A and 14L</P1></P>
<P>21. The Claim states that after the release of this Court's decision, the SIU re-opened their investigation and that this time Mr. Maharaj agreed to be interviewed. The Claim states that the SIU investigators reviewed all the records, including the videotape of Mr. Maharaj, and determined the rib injury post-dated the time of arrest and his physical demeanour during his videotaped statement was inconsistent with having sustained any rib injury. As such, the allegations were not substantiated. The report is not in evidence and it is unclear whether the report dealt with the allegations of abuse by Mr. Maharaj beyond the rib injury or with the allegations of Mr. Singh. It does not appear that the respondents were interviewed as part of the investigation.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para, 38, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1>
<P1>Howe Affidavit, para. 5, Appeal Book, Tab 14</P1></P>
<P>22. On May 26, 2014, the Chief of the TPS asked the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) to conduct an independent review of the review conducted by the PSU. In her report dated April 9, 2015, the OPP investigator concluded she had no reason to refute the conclusion of the PSU that the allegations could not be substantiated. It is unclear whether any additional witnesses were interviewed or evidence gathered. Ontario does not have a copy of this report.

<P1>Howe Affidavit, para. 5, Appeal Book, Tab 14</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>THE RESPONDENTS' ACTION</TI>
<P>23. On June 22, 2016, the respondents commenced a claim against the Attorney General, alleging that but for the negligent and misfeasant conduct of the Crowns, the Superior Court and this Court would not have made the findings they did and the respondents' reputations would not have been damaged.
<P1>Notice, <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM>, s. 7(1), served October 20, 2015, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; to the Howe Affidavit, Tab 14I</P1>
<P1>Section 7(1)(2), <EM>Proceedings Against the Crown Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 27</P1>
<P1>Statement of Claim, paras. 42 - 43, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>24. Specifically, the Claim alleges that the trial Crowns did not properly investigate the allegations of assault; did not call the respondents to testify regarding the allegations; and did not present other evidence to refute the allegations.
<P1>Statement of Claim, para. 28, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>
<P>25. With respect to the appellate Crown, the Claim alleges that she failed to bring a fresh evidence application with respect to the PSU report and failed to properly advise this Court of the alleged &ldquo;exculpatory findings&rdquo; made with respect to the respondents in that report. The transcript of the hearing before this Court reveals that in fact Ms. Alyea advised the Court of the existence of the PSU report and repeatedly offered to provide it for the Court's review but the panel hearing the appeal ultimately declined to consider it.

<P>26. The respondents appear to ground their misfeasance allegations in an alleged breach of the statutory obligations of Crown Attorneys under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>. In paragraphs 45 and 46 of the Claim the respondents state
<QUOTE><P>45. Ms. Cressman, Mr. Armstrong, Ms. Alyea, and the other crown law officers who had direct or indirect knowledge of this case, conduct their duties as crown attorneys, pursuant to the statutory obligations set out in the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 49;</P>

<P1>Statement of Claim, at paras. 45 and 46, Appeal Book, Tab 10</P1></P>

<P>28. The plaintiffs assert that the following allegations, which are excerpted from the Claim, were deliberate and constitute unlawful conduct because they purportedly contravene the &ldquo;sworn statutory duty&rdquo; of Crown Attorneys, thus giving rise to their claim in misfeasance:
<P1>i. They failed to properly ascertain the veracity of Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh's allegations of abuse;</P1>
<P1>ii. They failed to call the police officers as witnesses in order to refute the false and defamatory allegations;</P1>
<P1>iii. They ignored key facts or were wilfully blind to them;</P1>
<P1>iv. They knew or ought to have known that there was good medical evidence to say, at the very least, that the injury suffered by Mr. Maharaj was older than the arrest day contrary to what was alleged;</P1>
<P1>v. They knew that the treating physician of Mr. Maharaj would have raised serious questions about the truth of what Mr. Maharaj was stating, had he been aware of video taken at the time of the arrest, that showed Mr. Maharaj moving in a manner inconsistent with having a cracked rib at the time;</P1>
<P1>vi. They knew that the transcript at the bail hearing clearly demonstrated inconsistent and contradictory allegations about the alleged injuries Mr. Maharaj claimed he suffered;</P1>
<P1>vii. They knew that the documentation from Maplehurst clearly indicated that Mr. Maharaj lied when he said that he sought treatment at Maplehurst for 3 (three) weeks with respect to a rib injury;</P1>
<P1>viii. The new material facts Ms. Alyea and her superiors became aware of which clearly exonerated the police officers and implicated Ms. Cressman's conduct, were suppressed by senior Crown law officers, and were kept from the judges of the Court of Appeal.

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MOTION TO STRIKE</TI>
<P>29. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike out the respondents' Claim and dismiss their action pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 on the basis that it was statute-barred; the action failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action in that the conduct of the Crowns could not give rise to liability in negligence or misfeasance, and the Claim failed to properly plead the constituent elements of negligence or misfeasance.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI>Motion on the Limitations Issue</TI>
<P>30. Stinson J. bifurcated Ontario's motion and determined he would decide the limitations issue first. On January 4, 2017, he dismissed that portion of Ontario's motion. Leave to appeal that decision was granted by the Divisional Court on January 26, 2018, and the appeal from this decision is being heard at the same time as this appeal.

<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI>Motion to Strike for the Failure to Plead a Reasonable Cause of Action</TI>
<P>31. On this portion of the motion, Ontario argued that Crowns are immune from claims in negligence and misfeasance and could not be liable to anyone other than an individual they had prosecuted; that the claim in misfeasance was not properly pleaded and that the decision to stay the prosecution against Mr. Maharaj was an exercise of core prosecutorial discretion and consequently was not renewable absent flagrant impropriety.</P>
<P>32. Ontario's attack on the allegations of misfeasance was fourfold:
<P1>1) The Courts had repeatedly held that the only tort for which Crown Attorneys were liable was malicious prosecution, and this was so even where the tort of misfeasance in public office had been pleaded;</P1>
<P1>2) The same policy reasons which negated a duty of care in negligence also negated the imposition of liability in misfeasance in public office to investigating police officers as the imposition of this liability would engage all of the same concerns outlined by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>;</P1>
<P1>3) In the criminal context, Courts are loath to review the decisions of prosecutors in the conduct of a prosecution (such as the decision to commence or discontinue a prosecution, or which witnesses should be called at trial), and will only do so where such conduct amounts to an abuse of process, is a <EM>Charter</EM> violation, or where the fairness of the trial is affected. Civil courts should be equally loath to review such conduct of prosecutors; and,</P1>
<P1>4) The respondents had failed to plead the requisite elements of the tort because, <EM>inter alia</EM>, they could not establish the &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; required to establish the tort of misfeasance in public office.
<P2>Factum of the Moving Party, Appeal Book, Tab 12</P2></P1></P>
<P>33. The respondents argued that the test for misfeasance was made out because: the conduct of the Crowns was deliberate in that Ms. Cressman knew of the available evidence and the consequences of failing to put it before the Court and Ms. Alyea knew of the alleged errors and the consequences of failing to correct the record; they both acted unlawfully in violation of their duties under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>; they did so for an improper purpose to protect their own agents; and they were willfully blind or reckless to the harm that would be caused to the respondents.
<P1>Factum of the Responding Party, Appeal Book, Tab 13</P1></P>
<P>34. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision allowing Ontario's motion in part. Stinson J. struck the negligence allegations from the Claim, but allowed the misfeasance claim to proceed. With respect to the Claim in negligence, Stinson J. found that the respondents had no cause of action for the same policy reasons relied on by the Supreme Court of Canada in its quartet of cases on Crown Attorney liability which limit liability to malicious prosecution and the intentional failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to an accused person.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court found that Crown Attorney liability should not be expanded beyond its current scope because the expansion of liability i) Would undermine the ability of prosecutors to discharge their important public duties, with adverse consequences for the administration of justice; ii) May influence the decision-making of prosecutors and make them more &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; in their approach. The public interest is not well served when Crown counsel are motivated by fear of civil liability, rather than their sworn duty to fairly and effectively prosecute crime; and iii) Would open up the floodgates of civil liability and force prosecutors to spend undue amounts of time and energy defending their conduct in court instead of performing their duties.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>35. However, Stinson J. did not conduct any analysis of the policy considerations outlined in the Supreme Court jurisprudence with respect to the allegations of misfeasance, despite acknowledging that Ontario was arguing that the same policy considerations applied to both the claim in negligence and the claim in misfeasance. Further, with respect to whether the &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; required to establish misfeasance existed in this case, Stinson J. found that this this was a matter of dispute between the parties, and on a motion to strike he was not called upon to determine whether allegations can be proven, but instead must assume that they could be. Stinson J. conducted no analysis of the particular statutory duty relied on by the respondents in their Claim and failed to recognize that this was a legal, not a factual issue. His Honour further found that the defence that the Crowns acted within the scope of their duties was a matter properly determined in a hearing on the merits and that the permissible review of a Crown Attorney's conduct in the criminal context was broader than the scope argued by Ontario. Finally, he found that there were enough facts pleaded to make out a claim in misfeasance.

<P>36. The issue to be determined on this appeal is whether Stinson J. erred in failing to strike out the respondents' allegations of misfeasance. The appeal should be granted because Stinson J. erred:
<P1>1. In finding that misfeasance is a viable cause of action arising from the conduct of a Crown Attorney;</P1>
<P1>2. In failing to conduct any analysis regarding the policy reasons militating against the expansion of Crown Attorney liability set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF> in the context of the misfeasance claim;</P1>
<P1>3. In finding that the claim in misfeasance had been properly pleaded and, particularly, in failing to conduct any analysis of the alleged &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; which is required to establish the tort;</P1>
<P1>4. Relying on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> when the Divisional Court granted leave to appeal that decision on the basis that there was good reason to doubt its correctness; and</P1>
<P1>5. Declining to consider the documents incorporated by reference in the statement of claim in deciding the motion, even though the consideration of such evidence is permissible on a Rule 21 motion or a Rule 25 motion.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>THE GOVERNING JURISPRUDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT MISFEASANCE IS NOT A VIABLE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF A CROWN ATTORNEY</TI>
<P>37. This Court and the Superior Court of Justice have repeatedly found that the only tort for which a Crown Attorney is liable is malicious prosecution; this is so even in cases where the tort of misfeasance in public office was pleaded.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Two decisions of the Superior Court of Justice, <CASEREF><SOC>Whitty v. Wells</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Ferron v. Goodier</SOC></CASEREF> suggest that a cause of action in misfeasance may exist regarding Crown Attorney conduct. However, it is submitted that the <CASEREF><SOC>Whitty v. Wells</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 4625</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> which found that it is not &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; that there is no cause of action in misfeasance in public office against a Crown Attorney, was wrongly decided. In <EM>Whitty</EM>, which was released approximately six weeks before this Court's decision in <EM>Brummell</EM>, the Court held that it was not plain and obvious that misfeasance in public office should be struck out on a Rule 21 motion based on prosecutorial immunity. The Court found that it was bound by this Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Folland v. Ontario</SOC><YEAR>2003</YEAR><CITE>64 O.R. (3d) 89</CITE></CASEREF> as &ldquo;the latest appellate guidance on whether claims other than malicious prosecution may be brought against a Crown prosecutor&rdquo;. That finding was incorrect as <EM>Folland</EM>, which held that the law had not been settled on whether there was a cause of action in misfeasance in public office against Crown Attorneys, was decided before this Court's decisions in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Miguna v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>. In any event, it is submitted that much of the reasoning in <EM>Folland</EM> was overturned by the Supreme Court in <EM>Miazga</EM>. Finally, <EM>Whitty</EM> and <EM>Folland</EM> have now been superseded by this Court's decisions in <EM>Brummell</EM> and <EM>Abernethy</EM>. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ferron v. Goodier</SOC><CITE>[2010] O.J. No. 329</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the motion judge appears to have assumed that a tort in misfeasance in public office is available against a Crown Attorney, but did not conduct any analysis in that regard. In any event, the correctness of <EM>Ferron</EM> and the Manitoba case of <CASEREF><SOC>Driskell v. Dangerfield</SOC><CITE>2007 MBQB 142</CITE></CASEREF> on which the Court in <EM>Ferron</EM> relied, was questioned by the Superior Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Baltovich v.

<P>38. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Miguna v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, released by this Court by the same panel on the same day in 2005, the Court found that it was not clear from the authorities whether a claimant had to establish all four of the constituent elements of the tort of malicious prosecution (particularly, the requirement that the prior proceedings must have been determined in favour of the plaintiff) before civil liability could be imposed on a Crown Attorney. However, it is submitted that the Supreme Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, released in 2009, confirmed that all four elements of the test for malicious prosecution must be met before civil liability can be imposed on a Crown Attorney. <EM>Miazga</EM> also confirmed that the purpose of the narrow exception to immunity from civil liability in the form of liability for malicious prosecution was to provide &ldquo;a remedy to individuals who have been wrongly and maliciously prosecuted&rdquo;.

<P>39. In any event, in both <EM>Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Miguna</EM>, this Court confirmed that whatever nominate tort was pleaded, liability could not be imposed on a Crown Attorney unless a claimant established &ldquo;malice&rdquo; as defined by the Supreme Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Prouix v. Quebec</SOC></CASEREF>: &ldquo;a deliberate and improper use of the office of the Attorney-General or Crown Attorney, a use inconsistent with the status of &lsquo;minister of justice&rsquo;&rdquo; and one in which the defendant &ldquo;perpetrated a fraud on the process of criminal justice and in doing so has perverted or abused his office and the process of criminal justice&rdquo;. Neither case considered the availability of a remedy for anyone other than an individual who had been prosecuted.</P>
<P>40. Since the release of <EM>Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Miguna</EM>, there have been significant developments in the law regarding Crown Attorney liability and it is submitted that this Court's findings in <EM>Abemethy</EM>, which was released after the Supreme Court's decisions in both <EM>Miazga</EM> and <EM>Henry</EM> (and after the decision of Stinson J. on the motion below) and <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, which was released after <EM>Miazga</EM>, supersede <EM>Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Miguna</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The decisions of this Court in <EM>Gilbert, Miguna</EM> were authored by the Honourable Mr. Justice Blair J.A. who was also on the panel that decided <EM>Abernethy</EM>, a decision authored by the Court.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. In <CASEREF><SOC>Abernethy v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, the plaintiff sued the Crown Attorney defendants for &ldquo;conspiracy, misfeasance in public office, breach of trust, intentional infliction of mental distress, obstruction of justice, intentional <EM>Charter</EM> and statutory violations and, in some cases, false arrest, false imprisonment and fabricating evidence&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Abernethy (C.A.)</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 5</P1></P>
<P>42. Ontario brought a motion to strike the claim as failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action. The motion judge granted the motion and held with the exception of a claim for malicious prosecution, which the plaintiff acknowledged she was not pursuing, the Crown Attorney defendants were protected by Crown immunity under section 8 of the <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, and by common law Crown immunity. On appeal from that decision, this Court held that the motion judge's finding in this regard was correct:
<QUOTE><P>The Crown Attorneys are protected from suit against them by the statutory and common law immunity outlined above. Ms. Abernethy candidly conceded that she is not asserting a claim for malicious prosecution. It follows that no action can be brought against these defendants in their personal capacities in these circumstances. See <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Thompson v. Ontario</SOC><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, leave to appeal refused [citations omitted] ...</P>
<P>In addition, on the basis that Ms. Abernethy's pleading discloses no factually material basis for a cause of action against the personal Crown Defendants, the claims against the Crown, itself, based as they are on vicarious liability, must fail too.</P></QUOTE>

<P1><EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.17, s. 8</P1></P>
<P>43. It is submitted therefore, that the only ways in which the civil liability of the Attorney General can be engaged arising from the conduct of a Crown Attorney is an action for malicious prosecution; and since the Supreme Court's decision in <EM>Henry</EM>, an action for <EM>Charter</EM> damages arising out of a Crown Attorney's intentional failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to an accused, knowing the failure to disclose would cause harm. As such, the respondents' claim in misfeasance cannot stand because there is no such cause of action against a Crown Attorney.</P>
<P>44. On the motion below, Ontario relied on <EM>Brummell</EM> as being binding appellate authority on the question of whether there was a cause of action in misfeasance arising from a Crown Attorney's conduct. In <EM>Brummell</EM>, Ontario brought a motion to strike out the plaintiff's action on a number of grounds; one of which was that the claim alleged torts for which Crown Attorneys were not liable, including misfeasance in public office, conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional harm. The motion judge agreed with Ontario, striking the action for various reasons including that &ldquo;the Crown Attorney was immune from suit, excepting for malicious prosecution&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Brummell</EM> was decided before the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>[2015] 2 S.C.R. 214</CITE></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities, Tab 8, which created the new <EM>Charter</EM> claim for damages for the intentional failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Court upheld that decision, finding that the claim was &ldquo;fatally flawed&rdquo; for the reasons set out by the motions judge. As a result, Ontario argued that <EM>Brummell</EM> was binding appellate authority for the proposition that Crown Attorneys could only be liable for malicious prosecution and not for misfeasance in public office.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 4809</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 47, aff'd [2014] O.J. No, 5566 (C.A.), Book of Authorities, Tabs 7 and 8</P1>

<P>45. However, the respondents argued that <EM>Brummell</EM> was not binding appellate authority for the proposition that there is no cause of action in misfeasance arising from a Crown's conduct because &ldquo;the appeal decision turned on a procedural matter unrelated to Crown Attorney liability&rdquo;. Stinson J. agreed. Ontario submits that this is a misreading of <EM>Brummell</EM> because this Court clearly found the claim to be fatally flawed for the reasons of the motions judge and the appeal did not turn on a procedural matter unrelated to Crown Attorney liability. As a result, Stinson J.'s finding that the <EM>Brummell</EM> was not binding authority for the proposition that Crown Attorneys are not liable in misfeasance is an error. In any event, it is submitted that the subsequent release of <CASEREF><SOC>Abernethy v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF> answers this question in favour of Ontario's position.
<P1><EM>Brummell</EM> (C.A.), <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 7&ndash;12, Book of Authorities, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>46. Further, it is submitted that even if Stinson J. was correct in determining that the existing jurisprudence regarding Crown Attorney liability was not determinative in the case before him, he was required to determine whether <EM>these particular plaintiffs</EM> have a cause of action in misfeasance. In other words, he was required to determine whether Crown Attorney liability should be extended to a new class of claimants: investigating police officers. However, Stinson J. erred in framing the question before him with respect to the claim in misfeasance:
<QUOTE><P>Finally, I must consider the officers' claim against the AG for misfeasance in public office. In particular, the AG asks me to find that that the plaintiffs have not made out the elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office in their pleading. My approach to assessing this claim differs from the officers' negligence claim, in that misfeasance in public office is a recognized cause of action, whereas in the former instance the plaintiffs were asking me to extend the liability of Crown Attorneys into a new sphere. This analysis is thus different, in that my task is to review the statement of claim and determine whether it contains sufficient allegations that, if proven, would establish the cause of action. As well, the statement of claim is to be read generously with allowance for inadequacies due to drafting deficiencies: see <CASEREF><SOC>Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells</SOC><YEAR>1991</YEAR><CITE>5 O.R. (3d) 417</CITE><COURTJUR>Gen. Div.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, Stinson J., June 13, 2017, at para. 138, Appeal Book, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>47. Later in his judgment, Stinson J. recognizes that Ontario is arguing that the same policy reasons that negate the imposition of a duty of care in negligence also negate a cause of action in misfeasance in public office:
<QUOTE><P>The AG submits that the same policy concerns against expanding Crown Attorney civil liability to include negligence claims by investigating police officers should apply to bar the expansion of the tort of misfeasance of public office. The AG submits that, in the criminal context, courts do not review prosecutors' tactical decisions, such as whether to present certain evidence or call certain evidence unless there is an abuse of process or the accused's fair trial rights are violated. The AG cites the following decisions in support of this proposition: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Hillis</SOC><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>R v. L.L.</SOC><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Miazga</EM>, at para. 51. [citations omitted]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, Stinson J., June 13, 2017, at para. 143, Appeal Book, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>48. However, ultimately, Stinson J. failed to apply the policy considerations in <EM>Henry</EM> to the misfeasance claim and limited his analysis to the permissible scope of review of a prosecutor's tactical decisions in the criminal context. Pursuant to the <EM>dicta</EM> of the Supreme Court in <EM>Henry</EM>, which states that the policy considerations noted by the Court in that case are relevant whenever the potential civil liability of Crown Attorneys is engaged, the failure to conduct a full policy analysis was an error. Moreover, Stinson J.'s entire approach to the misfeasance allegations is predicated on the error that misfeasance is a recognized cause of action against a Crown Attorney, and that the main thrust of Ontario's submission was that the tort was not properly pleaded. As set out below, when the <EM>Henry</EM> policy analysis is conducted in the context of the misfeasance claim, it is clear that there is no difference between a claim in negligence and a claim in misfeasance from a policy perspective. The respondents should have no cause of action in negligence or misfeasance in public office against the Attorney General.

<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>POLICY CONSIDERATIONS NEGATE A CAUSE OF ACTION OF MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE FOR THE RESPONDENTS</TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The prospect of liability for misfeasance would divert Crowns from their duties and have a chilling effect on their conduct</EM></TI>
<P>49. In <EM>Henry</EM>, the Supreme Court considered whether the liability arising out of a Crown Attorney's conduct should be expanded to include a claim for <EM>Charter</EM> damages for the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to an accused person and, if it was to be so expanded, what the threshold of liability should be. The Court found that the tort of malicious prosecution involved the discretionary decision of a prosecutor to commence, continue or conclude a prosecution and because disclosure to an accused person was not discretionary, but instead was a constitutional obligation, it did not fit well within the rubric of malicious prosecution. Further, the high standard of malice required in respect of a Crown Attorney's tort liability was not appropriate for a <EM>Charter</EM> claim for damages for the intentional failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to an accused person. However, in so finding the Court recognized that important policy considerations were engaged when determining the &ldquo;spectre of liability&rdquo; of Crown Attorneys:
<QUOTE><P>There are two policy considerations from the malicious prosecution trilogy that I wish to emphasize. First, the liability threshold must ensure that Crown counsel will not be diverted from their important public duties by having to defend against a litany of civil claims. Second, the liability threshold must avoid a widespread &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on the behaviour of prosecutors. [...]</P>
<P>The policy concerns raised in the malicious prosecution trilogy are not confined to the exercise of core prosecutorial discretion. In my view, those concerns have a broader reach and are implicated wherever there is a risk of undue interference with the ability of prosecutors to freely carry out their duties in furtherance of the administration of justice.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Henry</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 70-71, 76</P1></P>
<P>50. With respect to the first concern&mdash;diversion from duties&mdash;the Supreme Court found that expanding liability by departing from a high liability threshold would result in Crown Attorneys being &ldquo;constantly enmeshed in an avalanche of interlocutory civil proceedings and civil trials&rdquo;, an outcome that &ldquo;bode[s] ill for the efficiency of [Crown prosecutors] and the quality of our criminal justice system&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Henry</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 72</P1></P>
<P>51. The Supreme Court further found that the second concern&mdash;the chilling effect on Crown counsel&mdash;also supported a high liability threshold because fear of civil liability may lead to defensive lawyering by prosecutors. It could result in decisions &ldquo;motivated less by leg al principle than by a calculated effort to ward off the spectre of liability&rdquo;. The Court found that &ldquo;the public interest is undermined when prosecutorial decision-making is influenced by considerations extraneous to the Crown's role as a quasi-judicial officer&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Henry</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 73</P1></P>
<P>52. It is important to note that the <EM>Henry</EM> decision deals only with the appropriate threshold for liability with respect to a <EM>Charter</EM> claim against the state for damages for non-malicious conduct of a Crown Attorney. The Court made clear that its decision did not in any way seek to undercut the Court's malicious prosecution jurisprudence, the basis of which is that Crown Attorneys enjoy a qualified immunity from tort liability and are exposed only to a claim in malicious prosecution, that malice in the form of an improper purpose is the key to proving malicious prosecution, and that the high standard of establishing malice is justified by the need to give prosecutors a sphere of independence from judicial scrutiny. The Court noted, in support of the need for independence in prosecutorial decision-making, that the same policy considerations outlined above would be engaged whenever the expansion of Crown Attorney liability is being considered.
<P1><EM>Henry</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 45&ndash;49 and 66, 76</P1></P>
<P>53. Certainly, Stinson J. found the policy considerations set out in the Supreme Court jurisprudence to be relevant and determinative on the issue of whether the respondents' have a cause of action in negligence against Ontario:
<QUOTE><P>It is clear that the policy concerns from the malicious prosecution trilogy, echoed in <EM>Henry</EM>, are &ldquo;implicated&rdquo; when there is a risk of interference with prosecutors' ability to carry out their duties. That is precisely the situation in the present case. The type of liability the officers are asking the court to impose would create a whole new class of potential claimants. It would require Crown Attorneys to consider, in each case, whether the reputational interests of the police dictate a certain approach to a particular case. It would divert Crown Attorneys from their basic responsibilities of assessing whether there are reasonable and probable grounds to prosecute a case, deciding whether it is the public interest to do so, and protecting and respecting the rights of the accused. Adding a separate private law duty to concerned police officers would add a consideration that is extraneous to those primary responsibilities.</P>
<P>An expansion of the responsibilities of Crown Attorneys to include such a duty could result in cases proceeding to trial merely to resolve the concerns of the police. It would alter what should be a co-operative relationship between the police and Crown Attorneys into a potentially adversarial one, in which police would become not just investigators and witnesses, but also litigants with a stake in the outcome, as well as potential claimants against the Crown Attorneys. The potential for conflict and disruption to the relationship is apparent. Moreover, in this era of strained judicial and court resources, the expansion of Crown Attorneys' duties in the fashion proposed by the officers carries with it the risk of increased time spent litigating criminal cases for non-core reasons, a most undesirable consequence.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, Stinson J., June 13, 2017, at paras. 134-135; Appeal Book, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>54. There is no reason why the findings above would not apply with equal force to a cause of action in misfeasance. The relevant factor in determining whether the policy considerations are engaged is not the name of the cause of action, but the very fact that a Crown Attorney could have any sort of liability to anyone other than a person they had prosecuted. Although Stinson J. acknowledged that it was Ontario's position that the policy considerations negated both a cause of action in negligence and in misfeasance, he conducted no analysis of the policy considerations in relation to the misfeasance allegations and made no finding with respect to whether or not these policy reasons applied. This was an error.</P>
<P>55. Moreover, the policy considerations are particularly important in this case because the respondents are not only seeking to extend the liability of Crown Attorneys to a new tort, but also, for the first time, to a new class of claimants: investigating police officers. The failure of Stinson J. to do any policy analysis with respect to the misfeasance claim is significant because it is difficult to ascertain how the recognition of a cause of action by a new class of claimants, whether it is in negligence or misfeasance, will not engage both of the policy considerations set out by the Supreme Court in <EM>Henry</EM>. First, expanding potential liability to investigating police officers raises the spectre of liability wherever a police officer may disagree with a Crown Attorney's handling of a prosecution, substantially increasing the potential number of civil actions Crowns will be forced to defend. Second, the spectre of potential liability to investigating police officers (or other participants in the justice system such as complainants or witnesses) could influence the exercise of a Crown Attorney's discretion, and cause them to consider their potential liability when deciding whether and how to proceed with a prosecution, making them more defensive in their approach to important prosecutorial decisions.</P>
<P>56. As mandated by the Crown Policy Manual and recognized in <EM>Miazga</EM>, when a Crown Attorney is deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution his or her only focus should be on whether there are reasonable grounds to continue the prosecution and whether it is in the public interest to do so. Stinson J. recognized the inherent conflict in duties that would result from the imposition of a duty of care in negligence to the respondents and that the interests of the respondents should not factor into the decision whether to continue a prosecution, or how to conduct that prosecution. The same issue and the same conflict arises where the claim is for misfeasance.

<BLOCK4><N>ii)</N><TI>The limited scope of judicial review of Crown conduct further militates against the expansion of Crown liability to a new tort and to individuals other than the accused</TI>
<P>57. On the motion below, Ontario argued that the limited review available to the Court with respect to a Crown Attorney's conduct and discretionary and tactical decisions in the criminal sphere was another factor militating against the imposition of civil liability for those decisions. Ontario argued:
<QUOTE><P>In the criminal context, the discretionary decisions of a prosecutor, such as the decision to commence, continue or stay a prosecution, are not reviewable by the Court short of an &ldquo;abuse of process&rdquo; or &ldquo;flagrant impropriety&rdquo;. Such abuses of process will only be found in the clearest of cases. The tactical decisions of a prosecutor, such as the decision to present certain evidence or call certain witnesses, will only be reviewable if there is an abuse of process or the accused's fair trial rights are affected. These standards of review demonstrate that the Courts are loathe to interfere in the conduct of the case by a prosecutor. Further, these standards militate against the imposition of civil liability regarding the discretionary and tactical decisions of Crown Attorneys for which the Court shows &ldquo;considerable deference&rdquo;. At the very least, these standards militate against the imposition of liability for anything less than malicious or deliberate conduct towards an accused person. As stated by the Supreme Court in <EM>Miazga</EM>, the review of prosecutorial conduct for abuse of process and malicious prosecution are two sides of the same coin. There is no case law to support a finding that a Crown Attorney's conduct with respect to anyone other than an accused or former accused person is reviewable in the civil or criminal context.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Factum of the Moving Party, Motion to Strike at para. 80, Appeal Book, Tab 12</P1></P>
<P>58. However, Stinson J. appears to have misapprehended Ontario's arguments, and the prevailing law, in finding that the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> held the tactics and conduct of the Crown Attorneys before the court are subject to a wider range of review than suggested by Ontario. However, Ontario's arguments accorded with the prevailing law. As set out above, Ontario recognized that the threshold for the review of the tactics and conduct of a Crown Attorney was lower than that for a matter of prosecutorial discretion and does not require an abuse of process before the Court will intervene.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Anderson</SOC><CITE>[2014] 2 S.C.R. 167</CITE><PARANUM>57&ndash;61</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities, Tab 15</P1></P>
<P>59. Ontario relied on the cases of <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Hillis</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. L.L.</SOC></CASEREF> for the specific proposition that a decision whether or not to call a certain witness, which is directly relevant to this case, was subject to only limited review by the Courts. As stated in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Hillis</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>Relying on <EM>Felderhoff, Kreiger</EM>, and <EM>Anderson</EM>, I find that the decision of the prosecution to call or not call certain witnesses at trial is a matter of Crown tactics, reviewable under the court's trial management authority. These decisions are, like all prosecutorial decisions, subject to review where the product of oblique motive. But they are also subject to judicial review on a lesser standard relating to the fairness of trial.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>As stated in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. L.L.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>The Crown's decision to call the mother, is a matter of litigation strategy. Such a decision does not relate to the nature and extent of the prosecution and the Attorney General's participation in it. It therefore falls into the &ldquo;tactics and conduct&rdquo; category. Although this category of conduct is reviewable on a standard less than abuse of process, litigation strategy is also entitled to considerable deference. As the Supreme Court stated in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. T(SG)</SOC><CITE>[2010] 1 S.C.R. 688</CITE><PARANUM>36</PARANUM></CASEREF>, trial judges, barring exceptional circumstances, must defer to the tactical decisions of counsel. Trial judges should not second guess the decisions of counsel who appear before them. Indeed, counsel are entitled to have a trial strategy and to modify it as the trial unfolds, provided there is no unfairness to the accused (<EM>Anderson</EM>, at para. 60).</P></QUOTE>

<P>60. In any event, Courts will only review the conduct of Crown Attorneys or their discretionary or tactical decisions in very limited circumstances in the criminal context, and the same caution should be employed in the civil context. Further, as stated in <EM>Miazga</EM>, in the civil context that review should be very circumscribed:
<QUOTE><P>... the public law doctrine of abuse of process and the tort of malicious prosecution may be seen as two sides of the same coin: both provide remedies when a Crown prosecutor's actions are so egregious that they take the prosecutor outside his or her proper role as minister of justice, such that the general rule of judicial non-intervention with Crown discretion is no longer justified. Both abuse of process and malicious prosecution have been narrowly crafted, employing stringent tests, to ensure that liability will attach in only the most exceptional circumstances, so that Crown discretion remains intact.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 51</P1></P>
<P>61. Ontario submits that Stinson J. erred in failing to consider this limited scope of review in imposing potential liability on the Crowns for misfeasance in relation to an investigating police officer. The respondents complain that the Crowns acted improperly in determining that the prosecution against Mr. Maharaj should not proceed. However, the decision to proceed with or discontinue a prosecution is clearly an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and therefore will only be reviewed by the criminal courts if there is an abuse of process amounting to flagrant impropriety. Of course, there is no suggestion in the criminal context that anyone other than an accused person would have any sort of remedy regarding a Crown Attorney's exercise of discretion. Stinson J. agreed with this proposition finding that he did not think the respondents had a claim with respect to the decision not to proceed with the prosecution of Mr. Maharaj.

<P1>Reasons for Decision, Stinson J., June 13, 2017, at para. 105, Appeal Book, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>62. The respondents also complain that Ms. Cressman acted improperly in failing to call them as witnesses in the prosecution against Mr. Singh. The decision regarding which witnesses to call in a prosecution is a matter of tactics and conduct before the Court and will only be reviewable if the conduct is an abuse of process, trial fairness is affected or there is a potential <EM>Charter</EM> violation <EM>vis a vis</EM> an accused person. Again, there is no suggestion in the criminal context that anyone other than an accused person would have any sort of remedy regarding a Crown Attorney's tactics or conduct before the Court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 36, 57&ndash;61</P1></P>
<P>63. Ontario submits that Stinson J. erred in failing to consider the specific conduct complained of and the limited review of that conduct permitted by the criminal court, which militates against the imposition of civil liability for the same conduct, particularly where the claimant is someone other than an accused person.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii)</N><TI>Motion Judge Erred in Relying on <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF></TI>
<P>64. It is not entirely clear to what extent Stinson J. relied on the decision of Matheson J, in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> with respect to his findings regarding the allegations in misfeasance. However, to the extent that he found that the existing jurisprudence regarding Crown Attorney liability did not apply in this case because the respondents are police officers and not individuals who were prosecuted, it is submitted that he was in error. On appeal from Matheson J's decision, the Divisional Court found that the policy considerations which negated a cause of action in negligence against a Crown Attorney <EM>vis a vis</EM> a person they had prosecuted applied with equal force to the police officer defendants alleging a duty of care against the co-defendant Crown Attorneys, and that these policy considerations were engaged whenever Crown Attorney liability was being considered. Further, while the Divisional Court was clear that the only issue before it in <EM>Smith</EM> was whether the plaintiffs had a claim in negligence against the Attorney General, the Court noted that the binding appellate authority in Ontario required a Crown Attorney to act with malice before liability could be imposed. The Court did not refer to the <EM>Abernethy</EM> or <EM>Brummell</EM> decisions, which is not surprising, given that the issue of whether there is a viable cause of action in misfeasance arising from the conduct of a Crown Attorney was not at issue in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>; the sole issue was whether there was a cause of action in negligence.

<BLOCK5><TI>THE RESPONDENTS FAILED TO PROPERLY PLEAD MATERIAL FACTS WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A CAUSE OF ACTION IN MISFEASANCE</TI>
<P>65. In <CASEREF><SOC>Odhavji v. Woodhouse</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court determined that misfeasance in public office will be established where:
<P1>i) A public officer engaged in deliberate conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer;</P1>
<P1>ii) The conduct was unlawful;</P1>
<P1>iii) The public officer was aware that his conduct was unlawful;</P1>
<P1>iv) The public officer was also aware that the conduct was likely to harm the plaintiff; and</P1>
<P1>v) The unlawful conduct caused the damages.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</SOC><CITE>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 263</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities, Tab 21</P1></P>
<P>66. There are two ways in which misfeasance can be committed. Category A involves conduct by a public officer that is specifically intended to injure a person or class of persons. Category B involves a public officer who acts with knowledge both that she has no power to do the act complained of and that the act is likely to injure the plaintiff. There are two common elements to both categories of the tort: 1) the public officer must have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer; and 2) the public officer must have been aware both that his or her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff.</P>
<P>67. The difference in the categories of the tort is the manner in which they are proven. Category A is proven by simply establishing that the public officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the plaintiff. To prove Category B, the plaintiff must establish the two ingredients of the tort independently of one another. For both categories, the &ldquo;essential question to be determined is not whether the officer has unlawfully exercised a power actually possessed, but whether the alleged misconduct is deliberate and unlawful&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Odhavji</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 32</P1></P>
<P>68. In <EM>Odhavji</EM>, the Supreme Court emphasized that the heart of the tort of misfeasance is unlawful conduct: either the unlawful exercise of a particular statutory or prerogative power; or &ldquo;more broadly based&rdquo; unlawful conduct in the exercise of public functions generally. The defendant must also be aware the conduct is unlawful. The Court noted:
<QUOTE><P>The requirement that the defendant must have been aware that his or her conduct was unlawful reflects the well-established principle that misfeasance in a public office requires an element of &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;dishonesty&rdquo;. In a democracy, public officers must retain the authority to make decisions that, where appropriate, are adverse to the interests of certain citizens. Knowledge of harm is thus an insufficient basis on which to conclude that the defendant has acted in bad faith or dishonestly. A public officer may in good faith make a decision that she or he knows to be adverse to interests of certain members of the public. In order for the conduct to fall within the scope of the tort, the officer must deliberately engage in conduct that he or she knows to be inconsistent with the obligations of the office.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>It is submitted that in this case, the respondents have failed to plead the required materials facts to establish bad faith, dishonesty, unlawful conduct or an intention to harm and therefore cannot establish Category A or B of the tort.
<P1><EM>Odhavji</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 32</P1></P>
<P>69. With respect to the statutory duty alleged by the respondents Stinson J. found:
<QUOTE><P>The dispute between the parties largely relates to the proper construction of the statutory duties of the Crown Attorneys and whether they were in fact breached in this case. At this stage, on a motion to strike, I am not called upon to decide if the plaintiffs can prove their allegations; instead I am required to assume that they can. The AG's defence that the Crown Attorneys acted within the scope of their duties and did not breach any legal obligations is a matter properly determined at a hearing on the merits.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Decision, Stinson J. June 13, 2017, at para. 150, Appeal Book, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>70. However, Ontario did not argue that the Claim should be struck because the allegations could not be proven, (which will be its position should this lawsuit proceed), but instead that it should be struck because there were no material facts pleaded to support the respondents' alleged &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; and that the alleged &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; (even if it was accepted that the Crowns had breached their oath of office during the prosecutions at issue) could never be an &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; <EM>vis a vis</EM> the respondents:
<QUOTE><P>First, the statement of claim fails to set out any material facts to support the allegation that the Crown Attorneys acted partially. Nor does the Claim plead any material facts to support an allegation that Crown counsel knew they were acting unlawfully. Further, with respect to the plaintiffs, there can be no unlawful act. A Crown Attorney swears to conduct a prosecution without partiality to any party. The parties to a prosecution are the Crown and the accused. An investigating police officer is not a party to a prosecution.</P></QUOTE>

<P>71. It is submitted that the oath of office of a Crown Attorney does not create any duty to an investigating police officer to defend them against allegations of assault. It clearly sets out a duty to the public to act objectively. Further, it is submitted that the decision not to continue with a prosecution or not to call certain evidence in a prosecution because of the belief that an accused's <EM>Charter</EM> rights have been violated is not, and cannot be, an unlawful act. This conduct is the type of conduct that will only be reviewed by the Courts in the criminal context if there is an abuse of process or the fair trial rights of an accused person are affected. Moreover, it is submitted that a Crown's exercise of his or her discretion not to bring a fresh evidence application on appeal can similarly not be an unlawful act. Consequently, even if all of the allegations of the conduct of the Crowns in this case (which sound more in negligence than misfeasance in any event) are accepted as true, they cannot give rise to any remedy for these respondents.</P>
<P>72. The tenuous nature of the unlawful act alleged by the respondents is evident when it is contrasted with the unlawful act alleged in <EM>Odhavji</EM>. In that case, it was pleaded that the police officer defendants had breached their specific and express statutory duty to &ldquo;cooperate fully&rdquo; with the members of the SIU &ldquo;in the conduct of investigations&rdquo; pursuant to section 113(9) of the <EM>Police Services Act</EM> by failing to co-operate with and frustrating the SIU's investigation. The statutory duty allegedly breached was direct and specific and clearly applied to the defendants. In this case, the statutory duty relied on is owed to the public and the parties to a prosecution and is a broad duty to act impartially, rather than a specific requirement to conduct a prosecution in a particular way, or to defend an investigating police officer in the course of a prosecution.</P>
<P>73. Further, while the respondents plead &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo;, they fail to particularize it in any way. As recently noted by this Court in <EM>Taylor</EM>, the tort of misfeasance cannot be made out by simply referencing bad faith in a Claim:
<QUOTE><P>...although bad faith may go towards demonstrating that a government official's conduct was unlawful, bad faith alone is not sufficient to make out the tort: <EM>Odhavji</EM>, at para. 28. Taylor's pleadings do not satisfy the other components of the tort: that the unlawful conduct alleged was deliberate and carried out by a specific, named official; or that any such conduct was knowingly unlawful and specifically intended to harm Taylor.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>In any event, simply alleging someone acted in bad faith in carrying out their statutory duties is &ldquo;wholly inadequate to sustain a pleading of bad faith. Bad faith must be pled with particularity&rdquo;. The pleading of bad faith in paragraph 48 of the respondent's Claim is completely bald.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Taylor v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2018] O.J. No. 611</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 17, Book of Authorities, Tab 24</P1>

<P>74. Further, there are no material facts pleaded in the Claim to support an allegation that the Crowns exercised their discretion in the manner that they did for the purpose of harming the respondents.</P>
<P>75. Ontario submits that Stinson J. was required to determine whether all of the requisite elements of the tort of misfeasance were made out in this case and whether adequate material facts were pleaded. With respect to the required elements of bad faith, dishonesty, an unlawful act and an intention to harm, it is submitted that Stinson J. failed to do so, and this was in error. Further, the Claim is deficient in each of these respects and the allegations of misfeasance should have been struck on that basis.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>4.</N><TI>MOTION JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM</TI>
<P>76. Finally, Ontario submits Stinson J. erred in failing to consider evidence on the motion below. Evidence will be admissible on a motion under both Rule 21.01(1) (a) and (b) where that evidence is incorporated into a statement of claim by reference. Further, where prior Court proceedings are referred to in a claim, the Court may consider materials from those proceedings for certain basic facts when determining whether the claim discloses a reasonable cause of action. Finally, the Court may also consider documents in addition to the statement of claim where they provide an &ldquo;essential factual context&rdquo; omitted from the claim, or are necessary to determine the &ldquo;substantive adequacy&rdquo; of the Claim.

<P>Lawyers for the Plaintiffs/Respondent, <BOLD>CLARK, BELANGER AND WATTS</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. NATURE OF THIS APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiffs/Respondents, Jamie Clark, Donald Belanger and Steven Watts (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Respondents&rdquo;</BOLD>) respond to the Attorney General of Ontario's (<BOLD>&ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;</BOLD> or <BOLD>&ldquo;Appellant&rdquo;</BOLD>) appeal of the decision of the Honourable Justice Stinson of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 13, 2017, refusing to strike the Respondents' claim for misfeasance in a public office.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. This action is about the liability of the Attorney General for the misconduct of Crown Attorneys in carrying out the prosecutions of two individuals for serious crimes.</P>
<P>3. It is the Respondents' position that during these prosecutions, Crown Attorneys acted deliberately, in bad faith and unlawfully by violating their sworn duties under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>.</P>
<P>4. In particular, the Crown Attorneys failed to call crucial, available evidence to rebut allegations by the accused that investigating police officers had committed egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations while working on the case. The Respondents allege that the Crown Attorneys' misconduct was motivated by an improper purpose. The Crown Attorneys were aware of the harm their misconduct would cause the police officers, and their unlawful acts in fact resulted in irreparable reputational harm to the officers, whom this Honourable Court labelled &ldquo;torturers.&rdquo; On this basis, the Respondents' claim against the Attorney General for the Crown Attorneys' misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>5. In the court below, Stinson J. dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike and allowed the claim in misfeasance to proceed to trial.</P>
<P>6. The Respondents submit that Stinson J. was correct in ruling that: (i) the Attorney General can be held liable for Crown Attorneys' misfeasant actions; (ii) the Respondents have pleaded the essential elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office as well as the material facts to support those elements; and (iii) that the issues of the scope of Crown Attorneys' duties and whether they were breached in this case (along with complex policy considerations about the effects of imposing liability) are matters that ought to be determined on the basis of a complete evidentiary record at trial.</P>
<P>7. For these reasons, the Attorney General's appeal should be dismissed, and the Respondents' action should proceed to a trial on the merits.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. FACTS</TI>
<P>8. The Respondents rely on the Statement of Claim's more comprehensive version of facts, the most essential of which are provided below.</P>
<P>9. The Respondents, Jamie Clark (<BOLD>&ldquo;Sgt. Clark&rdquo;</BOLD>), Donald Belanger (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Belanger&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Steven Watts (<BOLD>&ldquo;Det. Sgt. Watts&rdquo;</BOLD>), (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Officers&rdquo;</BOLD>), are police officers with the Toronto Police Service. They were members of the Hold-Up Squad at the relevant time.</P>
<P>10. In February 2009, the Officers investigated a very serious robbery and forcible confinement at a commercial establishment. The perpetrators had brandished a firearm, zip-tied the victim, duct-taped his mouth and forcibly confined him while stealing approximately $389,000 of copper tubing.
<P1><BOLD>Officers' <UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER>, June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;<UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER>&rdquo;) at para. 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. On or about June 11, 2009, after a thorough investigation, the Officers formulated reasonable and probable grounds to arrest Neil Singh (<BOLD>&ldquo;Singh&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Randy Maharaj (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maharaj&rdquo;</BOLD>) and charge them with various offences in connection with the crime. Upon their arrest, both accused gave statements, which were video recorded. The accused elected to have a preliminary inquiry following which they were committed to stand trial.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 9&ndash;11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. For the first time, over two and a half years later<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>During a June 12, 2009 bail hearing, counsel for Maharaj said that his client had suffered injuries&mdash;bumps and scratches behind his ear&mdash;during the arrest. Counsel did not allege any assaultive conduct by the Officers during the interrogations. Nor was it alleged that there was any injury to Maharaj's rib. During the preliminary inquiry, counsel asked the police witnesses about physically assaulting the accused, and the Officers categorically denied the assault had taken place (see <UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 10).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, at the trial in the Superior Court of Justice before Justice Thorburn, the two accused brought applications to stay proceedings based on alleged physical mistreatment at the hands of the Officers following their arrest. Maharaj alleged that he had been physically assaulted before he provided his inculpatory statement. The nature of the assault was so vicious that he alleged he had suffered a &ldquo;cracked rib&rdquo; in the process. To attempt to buttress his claim, his counsel provided the Crown with an X-ray of Maharaj's chest taken after his arrest.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 10&ndash;13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. The Crown assigned to the case, Sheila Cressman (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Cressman&rdquo;</BOLD>), consulted Dr. Farley Moss (<BOLD>&ldquo;Dr. Moss&rdquo;</BOLD>) at Scarborough Centenary Hospital regarding the X-Ray. Dr. Moss confirmed the X-Ray showed a fractured rib, and said that this injury would cause excruciating pain if a person moved his upper arms or body. Dr. Moss said it was <BOLD><UNDER>possible</UNDER></BOLD> the rib injury occurred on the day of the arrest.</P>
<P>14. Dr. Moss was not provided with a copy of Maharaj's videotaped statement to assess whether or not it was consistent with someone having just had their rib broken, as Maharaj had alleged. During that videotaped statement, Maharaj is seen freely using his arms and carrying on in such a way that it was not possible he had sustained the rib injury at the time (this will be dealt with more fully below).
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 14&ndash;16.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The Respondents have pleaded that Ms. Cressman failed to take further obvious and appropriate steps to investigate Maharaj's allegation. In particular, Ms. Cressman:
<P1>(a) never asked Dr. Moss to review the videotaped statement, in which Maharaj is seen making various movements with his arms that were incompatible with having a fresh rib injury;</P1>
<P1>(b) never asked Dr. Moss further questions regarding other potential time periods in which the injury could have occurred;</P1>
<P1>(c) never made inquiries of staff at Maplehurst Detention Centre (<BOLD>&ldquo;Maplehurst&rdquo;</BOLD>), where Maharaj was incarcerated during his trial, about Maharaj, even though she was in possession of Maharaj's medical records from the facility that showed no complaints about a rib injury any time after his arrest;</P1>
<P1>(d) did not properly review the transcripts of the bail hearing to understand the inconsistent injuries reported then as opposed to those reported at the time of the stay application; and</P1>
<P1>(e) did not seek further advice or comment from the Officers who had testified at the preliminary hearing and adamantly denied assaulting Maharaj.</P1></P>
<P>16. Despite her failure to take any steps to properly investigate the unsubstantiated allegation, Ms. Cressman, in consultation with senior Crown Attorney Frank Armstrong (<BOLD>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong&rdquo;</BOLD>), decided that Maharaj's statement would not be admissible because of involuntariness and therefore there would be no case against him. Mr. Armstrong did not direct Ms. Cressman or anyone else to conduct a further investigation into the allegation. The Crown decided to stay the charges against Maharaj on November 22, 2011.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 16&ndash;22 and 28.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Singh's trial commenced on November 28, 2011. Singh also sought to stay the proceedings against him on the basis of abusive police conduct. He falsely testified that he also had been assaulted by the Officers. He relied on the purported mistreatment of Maharaj at the hands of the police to buttress his claim. On the ensuing application, Maharaj provided <EM>viva voce</EM> evidence that he had been assaulted by the Officers.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 19.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Although aware that the Officers had previously testified under oath that they did not engage in any assaultive conduct and would testify to that effect if called as witnesses, Ms. Cressman called no evidence to challenge or contradict the false testimony. Rather, she essentially accepted that the alleged assaults had occurred. She did so notwithstanding that she had assured Det. Sgt. Watt that he and the other Officers would be called as witnesses. However, after the first day of hearing, Ms. Cressman informed Det. Sgt. Watt she would not require the Officers' evidence. Though Det. Sgt. Watt expressed his concern to Ms. Cressman about how this decision would adversely affect the outcome of the case and findings that might be made against the Officers, Ms. Cressman would not change her position and the Officers were prevented from testifying.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 19&ndash;21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. The Officers were not parties to the proceeding involving the Appellant and Singh and, to the knowledge of the Crown, had no standing to adduce evidence or make representations to the Court. The Officers relied on the Appellant to ensure that findings of illegal and improper conduct were not made against them in the absence of a full and complete record. Although the Crown could not control whether a Court might make those findings, the Crown could control whether the trial Court had all information relevant to the Officers' conduct given the potential for adverse findings against the Officers.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 20-21, 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. Ms. Cressman did not require Singh's counsel to prove the nature of the alleged assault, nor did she test the evidence in any way. She simply conceded that the assaultive conduct, as falsely alleged, had occurred and that there had been a serious <EM>Charter</EM> violation. Ms. Cressman knew at the time that doing so would have serious repercussions not only for the case she was prosecuting but for the Officers as well.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 22.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. In the face of the Crown's factual and legal concessions, Justice Thorburn concluded that the conduct alleged by Maharaj and Singh had occurred as they alleged. Essentially, it was the Court's view that in the absence of any competing evidence, the only conclusion available was to accept the evidence of Maharaj and Singh, which the Court did in a judgement released on March 28, 2012.</P>
<P>22. However, Thorburn J. did not stay the proceedings. Singh was subsequently convicted by a jury of armed robbery and forceful confinement. Though Justice Thorburn dismissed Singh's stay application, she reduced Singh's sentence because of the Officers' &ldquo;brutality&rdquo; and &ldquo;thoroughly reprehensible&rdquo; behaviour in the case. The Court's findings were widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet. Singh appealed the decision of Thorburn J. refusing to stay the proceedings to this Honourable Court.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 23-24.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Following the judgment, the Crown Law Office&mdash;Criminal notified the Chief of Police of their concerns about the Officers' conduct. The Special Investigations Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;SIU&rdquo;</BOLD>) invoked its mandate to conduct an investigation. However, Maharaj refused to be interviewed or to participate in the investigation, and the SIU withdrew its mandate in July 2012.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. After the SIU withdrew its mandate, the Toronto Police Service Professional Standards Unit (<BOLD>&ldquo;TPSPS&rdquo;</BOLD>) conducted a comprehensive and independent review of the allegations of misconduct against the Officers. The investigators concluded that, based on an analysis of all the evidence, the allegations that the Officers used excessive force could not be substantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 30.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. In and around November 2012, the Crown Law Office was made aware of these new material facts that demonstrated the serious injustice that had been done to the Officers. The Crown took no action in response.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 31, 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. Before Singh's appeal was argued, Det. Sgt. Watt met with Amy Alyea (<BOLD>&ldquo;Ms. Alyea&rdquo;</BOLD>), who was going to argue the appeal on behalf of the Crown. He told Ms. Alyea that an egregious mistake had occurred. He advised Ms. Alyea of the results of the TPSPS report, of which she had a copy, and of Ms. Cressman's conduct. He asked Ms. Alyea to correct the injustice that had occurred in the lower court in whatever manner was appropriate.</P>
<P>27. Despite Det. Sgt. Watt's efforts, Ms. Alyea: (i) took no steps to investigate further, (ii) took no steps to rectify and repair the damage that had been done to the Officers' reputations, and (iii) took no steps to prepare and file an application to introduce fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal. During oral arguments in the appeal, the Court asked several questions about the Officers' behaviour, but Ms. Alyea never adequately advised the Court of the new material facts the Crown had learned or of the TPSPS's exculpatory findings regarding the Officers' conduct. Any attempt made by Ms. Alyea to alert the Court to the TPSPS findings or the substance of the report fell far below what was required in the circumstances. The report was not properly before the Court nor had it been properly disclosed to counsel for Mr. Singh.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 32-33, 35, 43 and 47.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal released its judgment, in which it granted the appellant's stay application. The Court condemned the &ldquo;egregious nature of the police misconduct,&rdquo; which it equated with &ldquo;torture.&rdquo; It found that the alleged abusive interrogation techniques were &ldquo;calculated, prolonged and skilfully choreographed.&rdquo; The Court stated that Crown counsel was unable to provide any details of the results of the TPSPS investigation. The Court adverted several times to the fact that the Defence's allegations were uncontradicted or uncontested by the Crown. The Court found the case for a stay more compelling because the allegations of &ldquo;serious criminal conduct&rdquo; by the police had gone unchallenged.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. The Court of Appeal's judgment was also widely reported in the mainstream media and on the internet. Articles about the case repeated Singh's and Maharaj's false and defamatory allegations, and condemned the Officers' behaviour.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at paras. 36-37.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. Following the Court of Appeal judgment, the SIU re-opened their investigation. Maharaj agreed to be interviewed. The investigators reviewed all of the records and obtained opinion evidence. That investigation concluded that Maharaj's rib injury post-dated the time of arrest, and that his physical demeanour in the videotaped statement was inconsistent with his having sustained any rib injury at the time of arrest (during his video-recorded interview Maharaj is moving about in a way that would not have been possible had he suffered the cracked rib injury he alleged he had suffered at the hands of the Officers). The SIU found that the allegations by Maharaj were not substantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 38.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. Also following the Court of Appeal judgment, the Chief of the Toronto Police Service asked the Ontario Provincial Police (<BOLD>&ldquo;OPP&rdquo;</BOLD>) to conduct an independent review of the TPSPS investigation. The OPP review was conducted by an experienced, high-ranking investigator. On April 9, 2015, the OPP investigator concluded the TPSPS review had been thorough and she had no reason to refute its conclusions that the allegations of police misconduct were unsubstantiated.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 39.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Officers Commence an Action Against the Attorney General of Ontario</EM></TI>
<P>32. As alleged in the Statement of Claim, several months after the Court of Appeal released its judgment, the Officers retained counsel. Counsel had the opportunity to review the entire record and listen to the audio of the oral arguments that were made in the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>33. After due consideration, counsel formed a legal opinion that they communicated to the Officers: the conduct of the Appellant may be tortious, and a novel claim in negligence and misfeasance in a public office could be pursued. It was only at this point that the Officers discovered that there was a viable claim, albeit a novel one.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Statement of Claim</UNDER> at para. 50.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Officers issued their Claim on June 22, 2016. In it, they claim as against the Attorney General damages for negligence and misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>35. In particular, the Claim alleges that Crown Attorneys owe a duty of care to investigating police officers and that this duty was breached through the conduct of Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea, and their superiors. The Claim also alleges that Ms. Cressman, Ms. Alyea and their superiors engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct that they knew to be inconsistent with their professional obligations, and that they did so in bad faith, with the knowledge that this misconduct would likely injure the Officers.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Attorney General's Motion to Strike</EM></TI>
<P>36. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the Claim pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 on the basis that:
<P1>(a) The action is statute-barred because the limitation period has expired: the Plaintiffs failed to commence it within two years of discovering the material facts on which the Claim is based. In particular, the Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Cressman by at least July 2012. The Plaintiffs were aware of the material facts giving rise to their claim based on the conduct of Ms. Alyea by at least December 12, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(b) The claims in negligence and misfeasance are not tenable at law. As Crown Attorneys do not owe a duty of care to investigating police officers, it is plain and obvious that the claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action in negligence and has no reasonable prospect of success. As the Attorney General states in its factum, &ldquo;[Aside from malicious prosecution,] no other action in tort is available against a Crown Attorney&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The claim in misfeasance is frivolous and vexations, as it did not provide full particulars to support this cause of action.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Decisions of the Motions Judge</EM></TI>
<P>37. Stinson J. bifurcated the motion, and heard arguments on the limitation issue first. On January 4, 2017, Stinson J. dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike on the basis of the limitation period argument by finding, <EM>inter alia</EM>: due to the legal and factual complexities of the case, it was not plain and obvious that the limitation issue would be decided against the Plaintiffs and the issue should only be determined after a complete factual context is placed before the Court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 43</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD><UNDER>Respondents' Book of Authorities</UNDER> (&ldquo;<UNDER>BOA</UNDER>&rdquo;). Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. On June 13, 2017, Stinson J. released his decision on the second part of the Attorney General's motion, i.e. to strike the Appellants' claim for no reasonable cause of action with respect to the claims of negligence and misfeasance in a public office.</P>
<P>39. In regard to both claims, Stinson J. held that it was not plain and obvious that Crown Attorneys have absolute immunity from civil claims, other than claims for malicious prosecution and intentional non-disclosure of exculpatory evidence. He therefore declined to strike the Officers' Claim on the basis of common-law Crown Attorney immunity.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clark v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 3683</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Clark</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 77, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. In regard to the claim in negligence, Stinson J. held that it is not plain and obvious that there is no <EM>prima facie</EM> duty owed by trial Crown Attorneys to investigating police officers to take reasonable care in the course of investigating and defending <EM>Charter</EM> motions alleging serious misconduct by police officers. However, at the second stage of the <EM>Anns</EM> test, Stinson J. found, in the absence of any evidence and on pure speculation, that policy concerns would negate the <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care Crown Attorneys owe to investigating police officers.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras. 104, 113, 134&ndash;137, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The Officers appeal of Stinson J.'s judgment regarding the negligence issue has been joined with the Attorney General's appeal of Stinson J.'s judgments regarding the limitations and misfeasance issues.</P>
<P>42. In regard to the claim of misfeasance, Stinson J. reviewed the Statement of Claim thoroughly and held that the Officers had pleaded the essential elements of the tort by asserting that the Crown Attorneys acted knowingly and deliberately, in bad faith and unlawfully&mdash;in contravention of their sworn duties under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 49&mdash;with knowledge that their misconduct was likely to injure the Officers.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras. 148-149, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. Stinson J. found that a determination of whether the Crown Attorneys acted within the scope of their duties and did not breach any legal obligations is a matter properly determined at trial. As on a motion to strike, it is assumed that the plaintiffs can prove their allegations, Stinson J. declined to strike the claim of misfeasance.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at para. 150, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>44. The sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether Stinson J. made errors of law and/or mixed fact and law in allowing the Officers' claim in misfeasance to proceed to trial.</P>
<P>45. The Respondents submit Stinson J. properly analyzed the elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office, and was correct in determining that the Officers' pleading satisfied those elements. Stinson J. applied the correct test to determine whether the claim should proceed, and appropriately held that the issue of whether the Crown Attorneys breached their legal duties is a matter that should be determined at a hearing on the merits, with the benefit of a full evidentiary record.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Law on a Motion to Strike</EM></TI>
<P>46. The Supreme Court has stated that the test applicable to a motion to strike is that,
<QUOTE><P>[I]t is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 17, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. A motion to strike is designed to weed out claims that are &ldquo;hopeless,&rdquo; &ldquo;certain to fail,&rdquo; or &ldquo;could not possibly succeed.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM> at para. 19;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Paton Estate v. Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 458</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Paton Estate</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 2 and 48;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Addison Chevrolet Buick GMC Ltd. v.

<P>48. The motion to strike is a tool that must be used with care. This is especially the case where the Court considers novel claims, including recognized causes of action that are brought for the first time by a particular class of claimant or in a new context. In these cases, courts must be generous and err on the side of permitting the novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Imperial Tobacco</EM> at para. 21; <EM>Paton Estate</EM> at paras. 11-12, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tabs 3 and 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><N>(1)</N><TI><EM>The Jurisprudence Does Not Preclude an Action in Misfeasance Against the Attorney General</EM></TI>
<P>49. Contrary to the Attorney General's argument, a review of the relevant judgments from the Supreme Court, this Honourable Court and other courts does not support the proposition that actions for misfeasance (or other torts) against the Attorney General arising from the conduct of Crown Attorneys are precluded. While it is true that, thus far, only claims for malicious prosecution and intentional nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence against the Attorney General have succeeded, that does not entail that other claims are precluded. Moreover, the appellate case law the Attorney General cites does not support its argument.</P>
<P>50. The decisions of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Abernethy v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> do not preclude an action for misfeasance arising from the misconduct of Crown Attorneys. In <CASEREF><SOC>Abernethy v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court upheld the motion judge's conclusion that, aside from an action for malicious prosecution, Crown Attorneys are protected from suit <UNDER>in their personal capacities</UNDER> by statutory and common-law immunity.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Abernethy v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 340</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Abernethy</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 12, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>51. The Respondents have never claimed as against the Crown Attorneys in their personal capacities. The Respondents do not challenge that section 8 of the <EM>Ministry of the Attorney General Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 17 provides immunity to Crown Attorneys in their personal capacities for acts done in the performance of their duties, nor do they challenge that Crown Attorneys are protected from suit in their personal capacities (except for malicious prosecution) by common-law immunity.</P>
<P>52. In fact, the Respondents have relied on Crown Attorneys' personal immunity to argue against the policy concern that imposing liability in the circumstances of this case would have a &ldquo;chilling effect.&rdquo; The Respondents argue that Crown Attorneys' indemnification from personal civil liability significantly reduces the prospect that their fear of civil liability will make them more defensive in prosecuting cases.</P>
<P>53. When this Honourable Court upheld the motion judge's dismissal of claims of vicarious liability against the Crown in <EM>Abernethy</EM>, it did so because the causes of action were not properly pleaded, as there was &ldquo;no factually material basis&rdquo; to support the claims. It did not dismiss the claims against the Crown because causes of action other than malicious prosecution were precluded.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Abernethy</EM>, at paras. 13-14, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. This Honourable Court's findings in <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> were substantially similar to <EM>Abernethy</EM>. The motions judge in <EM>Brummell</EM> held that Crown Attorneys were generally immune from suit, excepting malicious prosecution, but this was meant in the sense that they are immune in their personal capacities&mdash;<EM>not</EM> in the sense that all other causes of action brought vicariously against the Attorney General are precluded. The remainder of allegations against the Crown Attorneys, which could only proceed vicariously through the Attorney General, were struck because they were not viable, either because they we re not properly pleaded or did not exist at law.

<P>55. As found by Stinson J., the appeal in <EM>Brummell</EM> turned on a procedural matter, i.e. whether the respondents had brought their Rule 21 motion in time, and whether the motions judge had erred in hearing the matter despite the delay. While this Honourable Court did note that the motions judge concluded the claim was &ldquo;fatally flawed,&rdquo; the fatal flaws concerned deficient pleadings in that the plaintiff did not plead material facts or alleged causes of action that did not exist at law (such as &ldquo;non-feasance,&rdquo; &ldquo;alienation of affection&rdquo; and &ldquo;false criminal allegations&rdquo;). The &ldquo;fatal flaws&rdquo; were <UNDER>not</UNDER> that the plaintiff had pleaded causes of action from which the Attorney General was immune.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM>, at para. 67, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Brummell v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 828</CITE><PARANUM>5, 7&ndash;11</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. For these reasons, neither <EM>Abernethy</EM> nor <EM>Brummell</EM> supersede previous decisions, as the Attorney General contends, nor do they stand for the proposition that the Attorney General is immune from all actions arising from Crown Attorney misconduct except for malicious prosecution or intentional nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence.
<P1><BOLD><UNDER>Factum of the Attorney General</UNDER> at para. 37n.5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. The other cases relied on by the Attorney General also do not stand for the proposition that all causes of action other than malicious prosecution and intentional nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence are precluded. Nowhere in <CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC></CASEREF> does the Supreme Court preclude claims other than malicious prosecution against the Attorney General for the conduct of Crown Attorneys. Instead, the Court clarified the meaning of the &ldquo;malice&rdquo; requirement as requiring proof that a prosecutor commenced or continued a prosecution with an &ldquo;improper purpose&rdquo; that is inconsistent with her role as a &ldquo;minister of justice.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 51</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Miazga</EM>&rdquo;), at paras. 81, 89, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. Likewise, the decisions of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. Gilkinson</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Miguna v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> do not preclude claims other than malicious prosecution against the Attorney General for Crown Attorneys' misconduct. Instead, both decisions focus on the requirement that the high threshold of malice is necessary to establish liability against Crown Attorneys when exercising their prosecutorial functions. In fact, both decisions indicate that causes of action other than malicious prosecution&mdash;including misfeasance in a public office&mdash;may be available if the high threshold of malice is properly pleaded:
<QUOTE><P>[If the allegations are] appropriately supported by material facts, and proven, they&mdash;and other facts pleaded&mdash;could support claims for malicious prosecution, breach of the Charter and misfeasance in public office as against the Crown Attorney and Police defendants.</P></QUOTE>

<P>59. This Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Folland v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> and the Superior Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Whitty v. Wells</SOC></CASEREF>, which followed <EM>Folland</EM>, both found that the malice requirement articulated in the <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy did not preclude actions other than malicious prosecution. Both found that <EM>Miazga</EM> did not address whether allegations of bad faith or malice could give rise to other causes of action, such as misfeasance in public office, and found that Crown liability for torts involving bad faith would not threaten the &ldquo;effective and uninhibited prosecution of criminal wrongdoing&rdquo; recognized in <EM>Miazga</EM> and <CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Folland v. Ontario</SOC><YEAR>2003</YEAR><CITE>64 O.R.

<P>60. In addition, several cases decided since <EM>Miazga</EM> have demonstrated not only that the Attorney General may be liable for causes of action other than malicious prosecution, but also that malice may not be a requirement for framing Crown liability. The most prominent example is <CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, wherein the Supreme Court recognized Crown liability for <EM>Charter</EM> damages for intentional nondisclosure; of exculpatory evidence on a standard that was lower than malice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Henry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 24</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Henry</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 66, 82, BOA Tab 13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. There is also a line of cases following <CASEREF><SOC>Krieger v. Law Society of Alberta</SOC></CASEREF> that suggests both that other causes of action against Crown Attorneys may be available, and that malice is not a required element of these claims. In <EM>Krieger</EM>, the Supreme Court defined &ldquo;prosecutorial discretion&rdquo; as encompassing &ldquo;core&rdquo; elements, including &ldquo;ultimate decisions as to whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and what the prosecution ought to be for.&rdquo; It is only for actions that fall within the scope of this prosecutorial discretion that the <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy limited liability to malicious prosecution. Where a prosecutor's conduct falls outside the ambit of these &ldquo;core&rdquo; functions&mdash;for instance, where the prosecutor's <EM>tactics</EM> violate her statutory or common-law duties&mdash;it may not be necessary to demonstrate malice or bad faith as a prerequisite to liability.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The example considered in <EM>Krieger</EM> was where the prosecutor failed to disclose relevant evidence. The Supreme Court found that such disclosure was a prosecutorial duty, and not a matter of prosecutorial discretion. In running afoul of its duty, the prosecutor was subject to review and discipline by the provincial law society. In this sense, <EM>Krieger</EM> can be seen as the key predecessor case to <EM>Henry</EM>, which cited the former for this proposition at para. 62. (Indeed, even <EM>Miazga</EM>, which is the central case defining the &ldquo;malice&rdquo; requirement, employs the language of a prosecutor's &ldquo;core&rdquo; functions to delineate where malicious prosecution lies: it is where the Crown prosecutor &ldquo;<EM>commenced</EM> or <EM>continued</EM>&rdquo; the impugned prosecution with malice (<EM>Miazga</EM> at para. 89)). In the case at bar, the Officers claim against the Attorney General for negligence and misfeasance for the Crown Attorneys' violation of their statutory and common-law duties, such as their duty &ldquo;to cause charges to be further investigated, and additional evidence to be collected, and further information that is likely to shed light on what did or did not happen to be provided, with the assistance of police, so that prosecutions may not fail for want of proof&rdquo;; to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented before the court for a determination on the merits; to be firm while being fair in prosecuting the accused so that the Court will not be duped by defences which are not thoroughly examined in Court; to call all material witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative of events; and to see to it that every material point is made which supports the prosecution's case (see para. 68 of the Officers' <UNDER>Amended Factum of the Appellants</UNDER> in the appeal concerning negligence). It is the Officers' position that, by acting in violation of their sworn duties under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 49 as well as their common-law duties, the Crown Attorneys were not acting within the ambit of prosecutorial discretion and that they may therefore be liable for negligence in addition to misfeasance.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In both <CASEREF><SOC>Driskell v. Dangerfield</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Ferron v. Goodier</SOC></CASEREF>, courts followed <EM>Krieger</EM> in finding that prosecutors may be liable for conduct that falls outside the scope of prosecutorial discretion (such as nondisclosure of relevant evidence), and refused to strike claims for negligence against the Crown for this reason.

There is nothing in <EM>Krieger</EM> that would limit the application of its reasoning to the context of law society investigations of prosecutors' misconduct, as the Court in <EM>Baltovich</EM> suggests at para. 33. While <EM>Krieger</EM> did not expand the scope of tenable civil actions against Crown Attorneys, its reasoning shows that such actions may not be precluded. Moreover, the Court in <EM>Baltovich</EM> clearly errs in reading <EM>Miazga</EM> as stating that &ldquo;<UNDER>only</UNDER> &lsquo;individuals who have been wrongly and maliciously prosecuted&rsquo; can bring a tenable civil action against a Crown attorney&rdquo; (para. 37, emphasis added). This proposition is nowhere to be found in <EM>Miazga</EM>. Both statute and appellate case law are silent on the question of whether parties other than accused individuals, such as investigating police, may bring actions against the Attorney General for prosecutors' misconduct.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>62. In any case, in regard to the Attorney General's appeal concerning misfeasance, the question of whether malice is required is moot because the Officers have pleaded malice and bad faith as elements of this cause of action.</P>
<P>63. Contrary to the Attorney General's argument at paragraph 46 of its factum, Stinson J. was not required to &ldquo;determine whether <EM>these particular plaintiffs</EM> have a cause of action in misfeasance... whether Crown Attorney liability should be extended to a new class of claimants: investigating police officers&rdquo; in ruling on the motion to strike. The tort of misfeasance in a public office, as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Odhavji v. Woodhouse</SOC></CASEREF> and subsequent case law, is not defined by any particular class of claimants. As the Officers have pleaded the required elements of the tort, the action should be permitted to proceed to trial.</P>
<P>64. For the above reasons, Stinson J.'s analysis of Crown Attorney civil liability is correct, and the decision not to strike the claim in misfeasance should be upheld and the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Clark</EM> at paras. 60&ndash;70 and 77-78, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>65. At the very least, case law is unsettled on the issue of the scope of the Attorney General's liability for Crown Attorneys' misconduct, including for misfeasance in a public office, and therefore the point is not properly resolved on a motion to strike.

<BLOCK4><N>(2)</N><TI><EM>Policy Considerations Were Not Appropriate on This Motion to Strike, and Would Not Have Negated a Cause of Action for Misfeasance in Any Case</EM></TI>
<P>66. Stinson J. was correct not to address complex policy considerations that might bear on the Attorney General's liability for Crown prosecutors' misfeasance in their public office. While such policy considerations are relevant, they are not properly considered on a pleadings motion.</P>
<P>67. In the context of negligence claims involving a novel duty of care, the Supreme Court has stated, &ldquo;policy concerns raised against imposing a duty of care <UNDER>must be more than speculative; a real potential for negative consequences must be apparent</UNDER>.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 41</CITE><PARANUM>48</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 20;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Fullowka v.

<P>68. The Respondents submit that the same principle is applicable in the context of a claim against the Attorney General for the misfeasance of Crown Attorneys. While the claim against Crown Attorneys for misfeasance itself is not novel, the context of investigating police as claimants and the misconduct that gave rise to the cause of action are novel. For these reasons, policy issues that bear on liability should only be considered on the basis of a full trial record.</P>
<P>69. To decide whether policy considerations negate or limit an action for Crown Attorneys' misfeasance without evidence would be a legal error. It is the Respondents' position that Stinson J. erred in law in his negligence analysis by finding the <EM>prima facie</EM> duty of care Crown Attorneys owe investigating police was negated by policy concerns without any factual basis. This is because policy judgments involve determinations of mixed fact and law. To make such determinations at the pleadings stage, in the absence of an evidentiary record, is to err in law by applying the wrong legal test.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Patrus v. Alberta</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 523</CITE><PARANUM>22-23</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER>, Tab 22.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>70. This Honourable Court has repeatedly emphasized that courts should not strike claims on the basis of policy considerations without an evidentiary record. This is especially the case where a novel claim is asserted. Without an evidentiary record, a court cannot analyze the strengths and weaknesses of competing policy arguments, and cannot confidently make judgments about legal and policy issues raised by the parties. To attempt to apply policy considerations without the benefit of a factual record is contrary to the principles on which case law has been understood to develop.

<P>71. Even if it were possible to evaluate policy issues on the Officers' pleadings, the policy considerations that are cited in the <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM> would not negate the cause of action for misfeasance. As the Officers argued at paragraphs 64&ndash;73 of their <UNDER>Amended Factum</UNDER> re: negligence, recognizing a cause of action for misfeasance by investigating police would neither divert Crown Attorneys from their prosecutorial duties nor have a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on their prosecutorial behaviour.</P>
<P>72. The kind of misfeasance at issue in this case does not relate to the exercise of &ldquo;core&rdquo; prosecutorial discretion&mdash;&ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; decisions such as whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased; whether it is in the public interest to prosecute a case; and protecting or respecting the rights of the accused. Instead, it relates to the statutory and common-law duties of Crown Attorneys. These duties&mdash;including the duty to cause charges (like allegations of egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations) to be further investigated, to adduce available evidence to ensure that cases do not fail for want of proof, etc.&mdash;are essential to the fair and effective administration of justice. When prosecutors violate these duties in bad faith and for improper purposes, and this causes foreseeable injury to others, they ought to be held accountable for this misfeasance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For a more exhaustive explanation of these duties and this argument, see paras. 60&ndash;79 of the <UNDER>Amended Factum of the Appellants</UNDER>, appealing the Order of Justice Stinson, dated June 13, 2017, with respect to the ruling on negligence.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>73. Far from diverting Crown Attorneys from their duties, a finding of liability for misfeasance in the circumstances of this case would cause prosecutors to do exactly what they are supposed to do, indeed what they have sworn to do pursuant to the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>: carry out their statutory and common-law duties.</P>
<P>74. Far from having a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on prosecutors' behaviour, a finding of liability for the Crown Attorneys' misfeasance in the circumstances of this case would motivate prosecutors to actively investigate allegations of egregious <EM>Charter</EM> breaches that can undermine a prosecution, bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and cause grievous and irreparable harm to investigating police officers.</P>
<P>75. As the Officers argue in their appeal concerning Stinson J.'s judgment on the issue of negligence, it is inappropriate to import policy arguments from the context of suits brought by accused persons against Crown Attorneys to the context of this case. The relationship between Crown Attorneys and accused persons is inherently adversarial. Setting the liability threshold too low in that context could risk a flood of litigation from persons who were subject to prosecution. By contrast, the relationship between Crown Attorneys and investigating police is complimentary, as the two must work together closely, in a relationship of trust and reliance, to ensure the effective administration of justice.</P>
<P>76. Even the context of the case, <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, in which police claimed against Crown Attorneys for the provision of negligent legal advice, is not comparable to the context of the case at bar. As Crown Attorneys are routinely called upon to provide legal advice on proper procedure to police, there are legitimate concerns that a low liability threshold could make prosecutors more defensive when they provide such advice. In contrast, it is extremely rare that Crown Attorneys would in bad faith violate their legal duties and concede egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations that undermine a prosecution and cause irreparable harm to police, without adequate investigation.</P>
<P>77. The Respondents could find no reported case where similar misfeasant conduct was alleged against Crown Attorneys by investigating police. It is therefore highly improbable that the policy concerns about liability from the <EM>Nelles</EM> trilogy and <EM>Henry</EM> would have the same bearing in the case at bar. In any case, in the absence of an evidentiary record, there is no basis for comparison.</P>
<P>78. Finally, the policy considerations cited by the Attorney General must be balanced against other important policy concerns. As the Supreme Court said in justification of recognizing the tort of malicious prosecution,
<QUOTE><P>Against [considerations that support setting a high liability threshold for prosecutorial misconduct] is the principle that the Ministry of the Attorney General and its Prosecutors are not above the law and must be held accountable. Individuals caught up in the justice system must be protected from abuses of power.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The results of the prosecutors' misfeasance were: the reputations of investigating police officers were irreparably damaged, and they suffered serious personal harm; the administration of justice was brought into disrepute and public confidence in the Crown and police force was eroded; the charges against Maharaj were stayed; and the conviction of Singh was overturned.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 66</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 26; <EM>Driskell</EM> at paras. 75-76, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 15.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>79. Setting the liability threshold too high could undermine the relationship of trust between two complementary parts of the justice system&mdash;investigating police and Crown prosecutors. It would allow Crown Attorneys to get away with misfeasant and bad-faith conduct in violation of their sworn legal duties. It would be an invitation to every accused to allege serious <EM>Charter</EM> violations in the hope that prosecutors will fail to investigate and the cases against them will be discontinued.</P>
<P>80. For the above reasons, the Respondents submit that the policy considerations raised by the Attorney General would not be dispositive in the case at bar. At the very least, policy determinations should be made after an evidentiary record has been established, and not on the basis of speculation or by importing policy concerns from other, dissimilar contexts.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(3)</N><TI><EM>Stinson J. Was Correct to Consider the Crown Attorneys' Conduct in Allowing the Claim in Misfeasance to Proceed</EM></TI>
<P>81. Stinson J.'s analysis of the Attorney General's arguments concerning courts' review of prosecutorial misconduct at paragraphs 143-144 of his judgment is correct.</P>
<P>82. The case, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> does not stand for the proposition that prosecutorial tactics, such as whether to call relevant and essential evidence, are subject to the very limited review suggested by the Attorney General. The Court in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> states,
<QUOTE><P>All Crown decision making is reviewable for abuse of process. However... exercises of prosecutorial discretion are <EM>only</EM> reviewable for abuse of process.

Hillis</SOC></CASEREF>). Nevertheless, as the Court made clear in relying on <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Felderhoff</SOC><CITE>[2003] O.J. No. 4819</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF> and <EM>Krieger</EM>, such a decision still constitutes trial tactics and is reviewable on a lower standard than decisions that fall under the umbrella of &ldquo;prosecutorial discretion.&rdquo; In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. L.L.</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 222</CITE></CASEREF>, cited by the Attorney General, the Court also recognized that the decision not to call a witness was a matter of &ldquo;tactics and conduct&rdquo; that was reviewable on a lower standard than matters falling under prosecutorial discretion. The Respondents submit that the trial tactics in the case at bar constitute the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; referred to at para. 13 of that decision.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>83. The impugned &ldquo;tactics&rdquo; of the Crown Attorneys in this case, which include the bad-faith failure to call essential, available evidence to rebut allegations of egregious <EM>Charter</EM> violations, are therefore reviewable by courts. This misfeasance was in violation of Crown Attorneys' legal duties, and was not a matter of prosecutorial discretion: section 11(a) of the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> does not say &ldquo;every Crown Attorney <UNDER>may</UNDER>&rdquo;: it says,
<QUOTE><P>[E]very Crown Attorney <UNDER>shall</UNDER>... cause such charges to be further investigated, and additional evidence to be collected, and sue out process to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, so that prosecutions may not be delayed unnecessarily or fail through want of proof.

<P>84. Moreover, nowhere in any of the case law cited by the Attorney General do courts suggest that persons other than the accused are precluded from bringing claims against the Attorney General for Crown Attorneys' misfeasant trial tactics. The fact that investigating police have not previously brought such a claim speaks to the egregiousness of prosecutors' misfeasance in this case&mdash;not to any prohibition recognized by courts.</P>
<P>85. For these reasons, Stinson J. was correct in determining the case law cited by the Attorney General does not support the proposition that preventing unfairness to the accused is the <UNDER>only</UNDER> ground other than abuse of process on which courts can review Crown Attorneys' tactical decisions.

<P>86. Stinson J. made clear in his judgment that, while he had read the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, he had conducted his own analysis of the case law and come to his own conclusions. Nowhere in his judgment does he state that he is relying on Matheson J.'s decision.

<P>87. Moreover, as argued above, the Respondents do not dispute that policy considerations are engaged whenever Crown liability is being considered. The Respondents respectfully submit that, in novel claims (involving new torts, or new claimants, or a new context), policy considerations should be based on a full evidentiary record and should not be dispositive at the pleadings stage. Even if the policy issues are considered at this stage, as argued above, they would not militate against recognizing the causes of action pleaded by the Officers.</P>
<P>88. The Respondents respectfully submit that the Divisional Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> was erroneous and, even if it were not, it is distinguishable from the case at bar.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For the Officers' arguments distinguishing the Divisional Court decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v.

<BLOCK4><N>(5)</N><TI><EM>The Respondents Properly Pleaded Material Facts That Establish Misfeasance in a Public Office</EM></TI>
<P>89. In response to the Attorney General's arguments at paragraphs 65&ndash;75 of its factum, the Respondents submit that Stinson J. identified all of the elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office and correctly found that the Officers pleaded the material facts necessary to satisfy those elements.</P>
<P>90. The relevant elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office are:
<P1>(a) The public officer must have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The public officer was aware that his or her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff(s).
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</SOC><CITE>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 263</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Odhavji</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 23, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 29.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>91. The following legal principles apply to the tort of misfeasance:
<P1>(a) If there is a legal duty on the public officer to act, and the public officer decides not to act or fails to act in breach of the duty, that omission can amount to misfeasance;</P1>
<P1>(b) Reckless indifference or wilful blindness to the illegality of his or her act satisfies the &ldquo;deliberate and unlawful&rdquo; conduct of the first element of the tort;</P1>
<P1>(c) Reckless indifference or wilful blindness as to the probable consequences of the unlawful act satisfies the second element of the tort; and</P1>
<P1>(d) The tort requires an element of bad faith or dishonesty, such that the public officer exercised her powers for an improper or ulterior purpose, or engaged in conduct that he or she knew to be inconsistent with the obligations of the office.

<P>92. The Officers clearly pleaded the &ldquo;unlawful act&rdquo; in their Claim: by failing to properly investigate the serious and unfounded allegations made by the accused against the police, by failing to challenge those allegations in Court with evidence that was readily available, and by failing to conduct the prosecution to the best of their skills and abilities, the Crown Attorneys in this case acted unlawfully and in violation of their sworn duties under the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>. These duties are detailed at section 11 of the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM>, and the Crown Attorney's oath to uphold them is at section 8.</P>
<P>93. The facts as pleaded demonstrate that this unlawful conduct was deliberate. Ms. Cressman was fully aware of the Officers' testimony from the preliminary hearing, which vehemently contradicted the allegations of misconduct. Ms. Cressman was made aware of the Officers' concern about the adverse effects of not calling them as witnesses to challenge the allegations. The Crown Law Office was aware of the findings of the TPSPS report that concluded the allegations were unsubstantiated. Det. Sgt. Watt advised Ms. Alyea of the mistakes that had been made, and informed her of Ms. Cressman's conduct. In the face of all of this information, the Crown Attorneys still failed to take the required steps to comply with their statutory obligations, and simply conceded a <EM>Charter</EM> breach that brought the administration of justice into disrepute. At the very least, the Crown attorneys were recklessly indifferent or wilfully blind to the unlawfulness of their conduct.</P>
<P>94. The facts as pleaded in the Claim set out that the Crown Attorneys abdicated their statutory duties for an <UNDER>improper purpose</UNDER>: their failure to take appropriate steps to inform the Court of new evidence and mistakes in the prosecution of the case was an attempt to protect their own agents' conduct rather than pursue the administration of justice. The Crown Attorneys knew this conduct to be inconsistent with their oath of office and in bad faith.</P>
<P>95. The Crown Attorneys were aware or were recklessly indifferent or wilfully blind to the probable consequence that allowing the allegations to go unchallenged would irreparably harm the Officers' reputations and cause them severe distress. The allegations were of the most serious and egregious misconduct, condemned by the Superior Court and Ontario Court of Appeal. The Officers expressed their concern to the Crown Attorneys, but to no avail. The facts as pleaded in the Claim therefore establish the second element of misfeasance.</P>
<P>96. Finally, the Claim pleads the facts necessary to establish that the unlawful conduct of the Crown Attorneys was the cause of the harms experienced by the officers (including irreparable damage to their reputations, and severe emotional distress), all of which are compensable in tort law.</P>
<P>97. The Attorney General's arguments that &ldquo;the alleged &lsquo;unlawful act&rsquo;... could never be an &lsquo;unlawful act&rsquo; <EM>vis a vis</EM> the respondents,&rdquo; and that a Crown Attorney's oath &ldquo;does not create any duty to an investigating police officer to defend them against allegations of assault&rdquo; are puzzling and without merit. Contrary to the Attorney General's assertion, nowhere in the <EM>Crown Attorneys Act</EM> does it specify that a Crown Attorney's duties are owed only to the parties to a prosecution.</P>
<P>98. Moreover, the Supreme Court has made clear that, for the tort of misfeasance, the nexus between the parties (the torfeasor and the victim) is created by the tortfeasor's &ldquo;conscious disregard for the interests of those who will be affected by the misconduct in question.&rdquo; This nexus falls under the second element of the tort: knowledge that the conduct was unlawful and was likely to harm the plaintiff(s). As described above, the Officers pleaded the facts necessary to establish this second element. Contrary to the Attorney General's contention that the Officers failed to plead facts supporting the &ldquo;required element&rdquo; of &ldquo;intention to harm,&rdquo; the Officers note that this is not a required element of the tort under &ldquo;Category B,&rdquo; as explained by the Supreme Court.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Odhavji</EM> at paras. 22, 29, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>99. The Attorney General's submission at paragraph 71 of its factum that the acts complained of cannot be unlawful acts and are not reviewable by courts is incorrect. The Officers pleaded malice (as &ldquo;improper purpose&rdquo;) in their claim. As noted above, the jurisprudence is not settled on whether actions taken pursuant to prosecutorial discretion are subject to review when malice is alleged, nor on whether accused persons are the only potential claimants against the Crown for misfeasance. Furthermore, the Officers have alleged misfeasance with respect to actions that do not fall under prosecutorial discretion, but are instead matters of trial tactics, which are subject to a lower standard of review.</P>
<P>100. Finally, the Officers adequately pleaded facts to demonstrate bad faith, in the sense that Crown Attorneys engaged in conduct they knew to be inconsistent with the obligations of their office for an improper purpose. As demonstrated by case law, &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; does not require that the tortfeasor act with intent to cause harm.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Odhavji</EM> at para. 28, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 29;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Finney v. Barreau du Quebec</SOC><CITE>2004 SCC 36</CITE><PARANUM>39-40</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA Tab 33;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Enterprises Sibeca Inc. v.

<P>101. For all of these reasons, Stinson J. was correct to conclude that the Officers have pleaded the essential elements of the tort of misfeasance and the facts necessary to support those elements.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(6)</N><TI><EM>Stinson J.'s Decision Not to Allow Evidence on the Motion to Strike Was Correct</EM></TI>
<P>102. The Attorney General has not provided any grounds to support its assertion that the transcripts of Court proceedings referenced in the Statement of Claim were &ldquo;necessary to determine the substantive adequacy&rdquo; of the Respondents' claims and &ldquo;to provide an essential factual context&rdquo; to the Claim. There is therefore no reason to disturb Stinson J.'s finding that the transcript was evidence that was not admissible on the motion to strike.</P>
<P>103. No evidence is admissible on a Rule 21.01(1)(b) motion. No evidence is admissible on a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion without leave of the Court or on consent of the parties.
<P1><BOLD>Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, Rule 21.01(2).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>104. While there is precedent to support the notion that evidence can be admitted in a Rule 21.01 motion&mdash;even a 21.01(1)(b) motion&mdash;if it is incorporated by reference in the Statement of Claim, courts have emphasized the limited use of such evidence: it may be referenced to establish basic facts, such as the date charges were laid, the exact wording of the charges, the time when the trial occurred, etc. It may not be used to determine the viability of a Claim:
<QUOTE><P>I am of the view that, with the exception of basic factual matters of the type to which I have referred, it is not proper to have reference to other evidence on a motion such as this for the purpose of trying to establish that the plaintiff's claim has no chance of success. On the contrary, I must look solely at the pleading and determine whether the necessary facts are pleaded to support any or all of the causes of action alleged. The issue of whether those facts can successfully prove the claims alleged when confronted with other facts is a matter that must be dealt with at a later date. To do otherwise is to muddy what is otherwise a clear line between motions such as this and summary judgment motions to the obvious detriment of the plaintiff.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Leadbeater v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2001] O.J. No. 3472</CITE><PARANUM>8-9</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, <UNDER>BOA</UNDER> Tab 37.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>105. At no point in his judgment does Stinson J. mention the need for evidence to establish basic facts or the substantive adequacy of the Officers' claims. As the decision about whether to admit such evidence is at the discretion of the Court, it is not clear why Stinson J. should have admitted evidence he did not deem necessary or appropriate to admit on a motion to strike.</P>
<P>106. Moreover, one of the reasons the Attorney General sought to have documents referenced in the Statement of Claim admitted was to &ldquo;establish when the plaintiffs knew the material facts necessary to commence their claim.&rdquo; Precedent has established that evidence bearing on the issue of discoverability should not be admitted on a Rule 21 motion:
<QUOTE><P>The purpose of Rule 21 is to determine questions of law prior to trial and to strike out pleadings if they disclose no reasonable cause of action. To allow the admission of evidence to deal with the discoverability issues, as proposed by the Defendants, goes well beyond the purpose of Rule 21. If I were to allow in evidence proposed by the Defendants, I would also have to allow in evidence on these issues from the Plaintiffs. Based on the submissions I have received from counsel, it is apparent that there will be many differences with respect to certain facts as they relate to the discoverability' issues. This result would go well beyond the intent of Rule 21. The application for leave is therefore dismissed.</P></QUOTE>

<P>107. For these reasons, the Respondents submit that there is no basis for a finding that Stinson J . exercised his discretion on this issue in error, and his ruling should stand.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Conclusion</EM></TI>
<P>108. Stinson J. was correct in finding that case law authority does not preclude Crown liability for actions other than malicious prosecution and intentional nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence.</P>
<P>109. He was also correct in ruling that the Officers had pleaded the requisite elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office and had included the material facts necessary to support those elements.</P>
<P>110. The issues of the scope of Crown Attorneys' duties and whether they were breached in this case, and the complex policy considerations about the effects of imposing liability for Crown Attorney' misconduct are matters that ought to be determined on the basis of a complete evidentiary record at trial. For these reasons, the Respondents respectfully submit that this Honourable Court should uphold Stinson J.'s judgment concerning misfeasance and allow the action to proceed to trial.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
