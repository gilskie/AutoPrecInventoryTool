<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Applicants, Drew Keith Allen (&ldquo;Allen&rdquo;) and Susan Michelle Byrne (&ldquo;Byrne&rdquo;) make an application for:
<P1>a. An Order permitting removal of the boundary tree located between the property municipally known as [[location omitted] and [location omitted] [location omitted]and more fully described on Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>b. Damages in the amount of $5,000.00</P1>
<P1>c. The costs of this application including HST thereon; and</P1>
<P1>d. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>2. The grounds for the application are:
<P1>a. Allen and Byrne are the owners of the property located at [location omitted]</P1>
<P1>b. The Respondents, Meghan Ann MacDougall (&ldquo;MacDougall&rdquo;) and Nigel Hamid Scott (&ldquo;Scott&rdquo;) are the owners of the property located at[location omitted]</P1>
<P1>c. On [location omitted]there is a mature tree that started growing on[location omitted] but has now grown large it enough that a small percentage is now growing on [location omitted] (the &ldquo;Tree&rdquo;) that is the subject of this application.</P1>
<P1>d. Allen and Byrne wish to fully use and enjoy [location omitted]by building an addition and conducting renovations to the house situated on the property to provide more room for their family of 5, address significant heating and cooling issues, and deal with periodic flooding of the basement.</P1>
<P1>e. To that end, in April of 2017 Allen and Byrne retained the architectural firm of Spragge &amp; Company Architects Ltd. to prepare plans for an addition and renovation to the house.</P1>
<P1>f. As the Tree is in very close proximity to the current foundation wall of the house, which is intended to be moved under the proposed renovation plans, the design for the addition and renovation calls for the removal of the Tree. If the Tree is not removed then no addition to the house can be done.</P1>
<P1>g. Allen and Byrne applied to the City of Toronto on June 7, 2017 for building permits in order to implement the plans for the addition and renovation.</P1>
<P1>h. In order to implement the design of the addition and renovation, Allen and Byrne made an application to the Committee of Adjustments in August 2017 to consider approval of minor variances required by the proposed plans. As part of such application, Allen and Byrne obtained consents from 7 neighbouring property owners demonstrating support for the project, including their immediately adjacent neigbours to the South and to the West (apart from those at [location omitted]).</P1>
<P1>i. Allen met with Respondents in mid-December to advise them of the Applicants' intentions with their proposed renovation and that, regrettably, the renovation plan would not be possible to be carried out without seriously impacting the Tree and that Applicants expected it would be most likely necessary to remove the Tree.</P1>
<P1>j. MacDougall and Scott responded to the Applicants shortly after the meeting by email claiming that they considered the Tree a boundary tree, their right to consent was therefore required in order for Applicants to be able to remove the Tree, such consent was being withheld, and that this was unnegotiable.</P1>
<P1>k. MacDougall and Scott made written submission to the Committee of Adjustments by email on January 1, 2018 indicating that, while they did not oppose the planned renovation itself, they wished to voice their claim that the Tree was jointly owned by them and that they would not consent to the Tree being removed.</P1>
<P1>l. On January 24, 2018, the Committee of Adjustments reviewed the written submissions and heard the oral submissions of the Applicants and the Respondents; and the Committee granted the Applicants' request for the minor variances in spite of the Respondents' submissions.</P1>
<P1>m. Allen and Byrne also made application to the City of Toronto, Parks, Forestry &amp; Recreation Division, Urban Forestry Branch (&ldquo;Toronto Urban Forestry&rdquo;) on December 28, 2017 for a permit to destroy the Tree.</P1>
<P1>n. As a precondition to issuance of the permit allowing the Tree to be removed, Applicants were required to erect and submit pictures to Toronto Urban Forestry of Tree Protection Zone hoarding, submit a replacement tree planting plan for approval by Toronto Urban Forestry, and pay a fee in lieu of planting one of three required replacement trees, as there are currently 4 other old and significant Norway Maples at[location omitted]and adding a third replacement tree would have been difficult to accommodate on the already crowded lot.</P1>
<P1>o. The Applicants signed an undertaking on April 19, 2018 in favour of Toronto Urban Forestry undertaking to abide by all conditions related to the issuing of the Tree Destruction Permit, including not destroying any tree prior to receipt of a Building Permit for the project.</P1>
<P1>p. Toronto Urban Forestry issued permit no. S-8662839 on April 19, 2018 to allow Allen and Byrne to have the Tree removed (the &ldquo;Tree Destruction Permit&rdquo;) citing the renovation plan could not be reasonably be completed if the Tree were not removed. The Respondents were copied by Toronto Urban Forestry on the notice issuing the Tree Destruction Permit.</P1>
<P1>q. On June 20, 2018 the City of Toronto issued to Allen and Byrne two building permits for the addition and renovation being: building permit 18 157345 PLB 00 PS; and, building permit 18 157345 BLD 00 SR (collectively, the &ldquo;Building Permits&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>r. Both Building Permits are based upon the destruction of the Tree in order to complete the addition and renovation.</P1>
<P1>s. The Applicants have taken no action to injure or destroy the Tree but have attempted to comply with all legal requirements and take every reasonable step to diligently advance their renovation project.</P1>
<P1>t. The Tree is a nuisance as it interferes with Allen's and Byrne's use and enjoyment of their property in a substantial way and such interference is unreasonable. The Tree is one of 5 Trees on [location omitted] all of which provide abundant shade and canopy to both properties. Under the Tree Destruction Permit, Applicants are obligated to plant 2 replacement trees, which is a small part of a landscaping plan involving the planting of numerous additional plants, shrubs and trees.</P1>
<P1>u. The addition and renovation to [location omitted] cannot be done in a manner that is reasonably appropriate for the needs of the Applicants unless the Tree is removed.</P1>
<P1>v. It is unreasonable for Allen and Byrne to be denied the full use and enjoyment of their property when the Committee of Adjustments and the City of Toronto have approved the addition and renovation with the removal of the Tree; and Toronto Urban Forestry has issued the Tree Destruction Permit.</P1>
<P1>w. Rules 1.04, 14.05(3)(d), 14.05(3)(e), 14.05(3)(h), 38 and 39 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P1>
<P1>x. The <EM>Forestry Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990 C. F. 26.</P1>
<P1>y. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P>3. The following documentary evidence will be used at the hearing of the application:
<P1>a. The Affidavit of Drew Keith Allen sworn on August 30, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>b. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Meghan Ann MaeDougall, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am one of the respondents in this proceeding, and, as such, have knowledge of the matters contained in this affidavit. To the extent that I do not have direct first-hand knowledge of particular facts or events, I have obtained specific information from others, and have indicated the source of that information in my affidavit.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Parties</EM></TI>
<P>2. I am a resident and co-owner of the property municipally known as [location omitted] [location omitted] I have resided at the [location omitted]since 2015. A true copy of the parcel register of[location omitted]is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>3. The Applicants, Drew Allen and Susan Byrne, are the residents of the property municipally known as [location omitted] A true copy of the parcel register of [location omitted] is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. The Applicants have brought this Application to advance a construction project at [location omitted] [location omitted] (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Proposed Construction</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Applicants' plans require the destruction of a boundary tree that is our joint property.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Norway Maple</EM></TI>
<P>5. A mature Norway maple tree, which the Applicants inventoried as &ldquo;tree #5&rdquo; in their construction plans, grows on the boundary line between the [location omitted] (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Norway Maple</BOLD>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<BOLD>Tree</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Tree creates a natural barrier between the two properties. A survey of [location omitted]created by Vladimir Dosen Surveying dated April 28, 2016 depicts the Tree on the southern boundary with[location omitted] A true copy of that survey is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>6. I understand that the Norway Maple is a &ldquo;boundary tree&rdquo; within the meaning of that term in provincial legislation and the common law.</P>
<P>7. The Norway Maple is a healthy, mature tree. Its destruction will fundamentally alter our home, the way we are able to use and enjoy it, and deprive us of one of the things we liked most about our property when we purchased it. The Tree provides many benefits, including cooling, noise reduction, privacy, and shade for our back deck. It is a focal point of our backyard, which we have invested and designed to serve as our primary living space during the summer months. More generally, Nigel and I consider the stewardship of our trees to be an important responsibility in the care of our property, community, and the environment.</P>
<P>8. At paragraph 55 of his Affidavit, Mr. Allen states that the Norway Maple is but one of five large trees that provides shade and canopy to our properties. This statement is misleading. While there are four other mature trees on [location omitted] these provide shade only to the bottom of our garden and our shed, and do not contribute significant shade to our property. Moreover, those are not our trees.</P>
<P>9. An Arbonst Report of Adam Vandermeij (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Vandermeij Report</BOLD>&rdquo;), relied upon by Mr. Allen at Exhibit A to his Affidavit sworn August 30, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Allen Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;) states that the &ldquo;<EM>current proposal</EM> cannot be constructed&rdquo; without destroying the Norway Maple (emphasis mine). At no time have the Applicants provided me with an alternative proposal to the Planned Construction. Nigel and I do not oppose the Applicants' renovation in principle and would not object to a development that accommodates our Tree. Unfortunately, the Applicants have brushed aside our desire to keep a Tree that we consider not only to be rightfully ours but also integral to the character, use, and enjoyment of our home.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Our Decision To Move to</EM>[location omitted]</TI>
<P>10. I moved to Canada from the United Kingdom with my family, Nigel and Dylan, in August 2014. After our arrival in Toronto, I spent several months looking for the right spot for our family to make a home. We settled on the Moore Park neighbourhood. Among the primary factors that drew us to the neighbourhood were its greenery, mature tree canopy, and proximity to the Moore Park Ravine and the Evergreen Brickworks. When we found [location omitted] we were especially taken with its backyard. It is relatively large for a city plot and has enough space for our son, Dylan, and dog to play and for us to entertain. The canopy provided by the Norway Maple was and remains essential to the shade and aesthetic of the yard.</P>
<P>11. Our family moved into[location omitted]in August 2015.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Proposed Construction Project at</EM>[location omitted]</TI>
<P>12. In and around April 2017, Nigel and I began having conversations with the Applicants about a proposed renovation of their home (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the Proposed Construction). It became apparent from these conversations that the destruction and removal of the Norway Maple was a part of the Applicants' plans. Nigel and I made it clear from the outset that we did not want the Tree cut down and that we would not consent to its removal. We told the Applicants that the Norway Maple was too important to us and contributed significantly to our enjoyment of our property.</P>
<P>13. Mr. Allen promised to share the Applicants' construction plans as they developed and became available. Throughout the summer and fall of 2017, Nigel and I periodically asked the Applicants about the status of the Proposed Construction and in particular whether their architect had come up with an alternative design that would preserve the Tree. Neither Applicant gave us a meaningful response&mdash;only that it remained a work in progress of their architects, Tom Spragge + Company Architects Ltd.</P>
<P>14. The Applicants did not provide us with any particulars of the Proposed Construction until mid&mdash;December 2017, when Mr. Allen came to our home with what he referred to as a &ldquo;proposal&rdquo;. I had expected that any plans would be preliminary (given the absence of updates), but to my surprise Mr. Allen presented us with detailed drawings that appeared to be a <EM>fait accompli</EM>.</P>
<P>15. At paragraphs 14 through 20 of his Affidavit, Mr. Allen refers to certain &ldquo;practical issues&rdquo; at[location omitted]that he says animate the Proposed Construction, including lack of proper insulation, risk of flooding, the presence of knob-and-tube-wiring. The drawings that he showed us in mid-December 2017, which are attached at Exhibit C to the Allen Affidavit, included many elaborate features unrelated to these problems. The project provided for major improvements to Mr. Allen and Ms. Byrne's home, such as a new primary kitchen and bedroom, as well as a brand new addition to make room for a walk-out basement, recreational room, an exercise room, music room, mudroom, and guest bedroom with ensuite bathroom.</P>
<P>16. Most significantly, the Applicants' plan for a walk-out basement necessitated the removal of the Norway Maple. Given the advanced stage of planning, it was apparent that the Applicants had known for weeks, if not months, that their planned renovation did not respect our stipulation that the Norway Maple remain intact.</P>
<P>17. Nigel and I immediately conveyed our disappointment to Mr. Allen. He admitted that he had not even asked the architect to try to accommodate the Tree, and that there was no way to keep it while adding all of the features that he and Ms. Byrne wanted.</P>
<P>18. During that same meeting, we discussed ownership of the Norway Maple. Mr. Allen insisted that he had control over the Tree since the majority of it was located on his property. He told us that he could gain access to and remove it without our permission.</P>
<P>19. In late December 2017, Nigel and I received a letter advising us of a Committee of Adjustments meeting to address the Proposed Construction. On December 23, 2017, we wrote to the Applicants to reiterate that we did not consent to the destruction of the Norway Maple. A copy of that correspondence can be found at Exhibit F to the Allen Affidavit.</P>
<P>20. In our December 23 email, Nigel and I reiterated our intention to retain the Tree and reiterated that it adds considerable value to our property and was in fact one of the reasons we chose to live in the neighbourhood. The email also informed the Applicants that the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> contradicted Mr. Allen's assertion that he could destroy the Norway Maple without our consent. We advised that in our view the Tree is a boundary tree within the meaning of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> and that it could be removed only with our consent.</P>
<P>21. We did not receive a response to our December 23, 2017 email.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Applicants Pursue Approval for their Construction Project Without our Consent</EM></TI>
<P>22. On January 24, 2018, the Committee of Adjustments held a meeting regarding the Minor Variances requested by the Applicants in furtherance of the Proposed Construction. Nigel and I, along with our neighbour, Louise Lang, attended in order to table our objection to the Applicants' plan to remove the Norway Maple. Our appearance was in addition to written objections we sent to the Committee of Adjustments in early January 2018, copies of which appear at Exhibit G to the Allen Affidavit.</P>
<P>23. At the hearing, however, we learned that the Committee of Adjustments was not the proper forum in which to adjudicate the future of the Tree. Specifically, the three-person panel advised us that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the future of the Norway Maple, only the Minor Variances requested by the Applicants. For this reason, we did not appeal when the Committee of Adjustments ultimately approved the Applicants' request for a Minor Variance.</P>
<P>24. As part of the Committee of Adjustments process, Nigel and I participated in a mediation involving the Applicants and their architect, Tom Spragge. Although Nigel and I viewed the mediation as a good faith opportunity to resolve our issues with the Applicants, it was not successful.</P>
<P>25. Nigel and I ceased communications with the Applicants about the Proposed Construction shortly after the January 24, 2018 Committee of Adjustments meeting. In late March 2018, Nigel's father was diagnosed with a severe illness, which disrupted our family life and required Nigel to travel frequently to England.</P>
<P>26. During this period, we received a copy of a letter from Lisa Carson, City of Toronto, Urban Forestry dated March 22, 2018. That letter advised that Urban Forestry had granted the Applicants' application for a permit to remove the Norway Maple. It emphasized, however, that the issuance of a permit &ldquo;does not supersede any civil or common law property rights&rdquo; and that it remained the Applicants' responsibility &ldquo;to resolve any ownership issues or other property disputes&rdquo;. A true copy of Ms. Carson's letter dated March 22, 2018 is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>27. I understood from Ms. Carson's March 22, 2018 letter that the issuance of a permit was necessary but not sufficient to enable the Applicants to destroy the Norway Maple. Relying on Urban Forestry's communication, Nigel and I decided that we would revisit the matter with the Applicants once Nigel returned from overseas. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to do so until April 2018, when we both returned from his father's funeral.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Applicants Commission a Survey Which Shows that the Norway Maple is a Boundary Tree</EM></TI>
<P>28. Immediately on our arrival from England in April 2018, Nigel and I discovered that the Applicants had erected Tree Protection Zone hoarding in front of their house. They could not have done so without accessing our property. The. installation of hoarding prompted us to inquire with the Applicants as to the status of the Proposed Construction.</P>
<P>29. In the conversation that ensued, the Applicants took the position that the City permit allowed them to remove the Norway Maple even without our consent. Nigel and I became concerned that the Applicants either would ignore Urban Forestry's message that we retained our civil and common law and property rights over the Tree or did not acknowledge that we had any such rights. We attempted to discuss the matter further with the Applicants in the ensuing weeks, including by way of an email from Nigel to the Applicants on April 10, 2018, but they refused to engage with us. A true copy of Nigel's email dated April 10, 2018 is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>30. In this context, we instructed our counsel, Stockwoods, to write to the Applicants to set out in clear terms our position that the Norway Maple is a boundary tree within the meaning of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM>. A copy of that letter, dated April 26, 2018, is located at Exhibit Q to the Allen Affidavit.</P>
<P>31. The Applicants did not contact us against until May 23, 2018, when they emailed to request permission for a surveyor to access our property for the purpose of conducting a laser scan of the Tree in order to confirm that the Tree straddled the property line. We agreed, on the condition that, among other things, the Applicants provide us with a copy of all such reports by the surveyor. A true copy of this email exchange is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>32. Askan Piller Corporation, Ontario Land Surveyors, conducted a scan of the Norway Maple at 9 a.m. on May 29, 2018. On June 22, 2018, the Applicants' counsel provided us with two images depicting the laser scan of the Norway Maple. These images, which are appended to the Vandermeij Report at Exhibit A to the Allen Affidavit, demonstrate that the Norway Maple straddles the property line between [location omitted]</P>
<P>33. We asked the Applicants to provide us with any reports that accompanied and interpreted the scans of Askan Piller Corporation. Despite these requests, which included the correspondence from our counsel found at Exhibit U to the Allen Affidavit, we did not receive the July 27, 20 18, Vandermeij Report until our counsel was served with the Application Record for this matter on September 5, 2018.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Community Support for Preserving the Norway Maple</EM></TI>
<P>34. We have received a number of communications from members of our community in support of our efforts to resist this Application. These include the following:
<P1>(a) <EM>Letter of Jeremy Gawen, Director of the Moore Park Residents' Association (&ldquo;MPRA&rdquo;)</EM>: In a letter dated November 19, 2018, Mr. Gawen advises, on behalf of the MRPA that the Tree &ldquo;is clearly a boundary tree, is very large and appears to be in excellent condition and we would not wish it to be either damaged or removed.&rdquo; He adds that the MRPA would likely have opposed the Applicants' application for a Minor Variance before the Committee of Adjustment had it known that the Proposed Construction involved the destruction &ldquo;of a beautiful, mature tree on the Boundary with #89&rdquo;. A true copy of Mr. Gawen's letter dated November 19, 2018 is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>Letter of Louise Lang, owner of</EM>[location omitted] In a letter dated November 26, November 26, 2018, Ms. Lang advises the large trees of the Moore Park neighbourhood, where she has lived for nearly 70 years, add significantly to the area's quality of life. She comments that Tree #5 &ldquo;provides a significant amount of shade for me and my husband&rdquo;. Ms. Lang adds that the tree's root system is beneficial in soaking up rain and melting snow and she fears that its removal could cause more flooding issues on her property. A true copy of Ms. Lang's letter dated November 26, 2018 is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1>(c)<EM>Letter of Michael Bertouche, owner of</EM>[location omitted] In a letter dated January 5, 2019, Mr. Bertouche advises that he made Applicants aware that he did not support their renovation because he wishes to preserve Moore Park's tree canopy. Mr. Bertouche expresses the hope that the Norway Maple will remain in place. A true copy of Mr. Bertouche's letter dated January 5, 2018 is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Response to Certain Allegations About the</EM>[location omitted] <EM>Backyard</EM></TI>
<P>35. The summer after we moved into [location omitted] Nigel and I hired an arborist, Bruce Tree Experts, for the purpose of evaluating the health of our trees. In June 2016, we developed a landscaping project based in part on that assessment.</P>
<P>36. We relied on a landscape designer, Alissa North of North Design Office, Inc. and contractor, Nickolaos Kon of Fossil Landscapes, Ltd. to perform the project, which featured, among other things, the replacement of our back deck, which had rotted and was unsafe. The landscape designer, Ms. North, advised us that she obtained all necessary building permits, and we posted these throughout the project. Ms. North explained that the City did not require a permit to injure because we rebuilt the deck on existing footing installed by the previous owner. A true copy of an invoice from Fossil Landscapes Inc. indicting that our deck was replaced using existing footings is attached at <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>37. At paragraph 62 of his Affidavit, Mr. Allen cites our removal of a tree as part of the deck replacement. Our decision to remove a pear tree was based on the advice of Bruce Tree Experts that the tree was diseased. It had nothing to do with the deck replacement. Ms. North, our landscaper, confirmed that the pear tree was diseased and advised that it was not big enough to require a permit for removal.</P>
<P>38. Nigel and I discussed our plans for our backyard with the Applicants before work began. This discussion included our plans for the deck and the replacement of a fence along our joint property line. The Applicants did not object to any aspect of the project.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPLICANTS (Application returnable March 26, 2019)</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This is an application seeking an Order permitting the removal of a boundary tree located between the properties municipally known as [location omitted] [location omitted] and [location omitted]</P>
<P>2. The boundary tree is a nuisance. The Applicants, like many other home owners in the Moore Park area, wish to modernize their home and add an addition. The Applicants' design requires the removal of the tree. The City of Toronto has approved the Applicants' design and has issued the required building permits. The Committee of Adjustment for the City of Toronto approved the minor variances required for the Applicants' design to be implemented. Most importantly, the City of Toronto, Urban Forestry has issued a Tree Destruction Permit because in order to implement the Applicants' design Urban Forestry found &ldquo;that no reasonable alternatives to tree removal are possible and the tree qualifies for removal under the By-Law.&rdquo;</P>
<P>3. Because the tree is a boundary tree, however, the consent of the Respondents or leave of the Court is required to remove the tree and implement the Tree Destruction Permit. The Respondents have refused to give their consent requiring this Application. The Court should grant the Applicants' request to have the tree removed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<P>4. The Applicants, Drew Keith Allen (&ldquo;Allen&rdquo;) and Susan Michelle Byrne (&ldquo;Byrne&rdquo;), co-own and reside at the property located at [location omitted]
<P1>- Affidavit of Drew Keith Allen sworn on August 30, 2018 (the &ldquo;Allen Affidavit&rdquo;), Application Record, Tab 2, paras 1-2.</P1></P>
<P>5. The Respondents, Meghan Ann MacDougall (&ldquo;MacDougall&rdquo;) and Nigel Hamid Scott (&ldquo;Scott&rdquo;), are the owners of the property immediately to the north of [location omitted] at [location omitted] [location omitted] are adjoining properties.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 4.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Tree</EM></TI>
<P>6. There are several large mature trees located on [location omitted]. One of those trees began its growth on[location omitted]and has, over time, grown large enough that it straddles the property line between [location omitted]and[location omitted](the &ldquo;Tree&rdquo;)
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 5.</P1></P>
<P>7. According to a report completed by Adam Vandermeij of Central Tree Care Ltd. (the &ldquo;Vandermeij Report&rdquo;), 78% to 79% of the total trunk and root flare of the Tree are located on [location omitted]and the remaining 21% to 22% are located on [location omitted]. At least 2/3 of the canopy of the Tree overhangs [location omitted].
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 6-7, Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Proposed Renovations</EM></TI>
<P>8. The Applicants wish to fully use and enjoy [location omitted] by building an appropriate addition and conducting renovations to the existing house situated on the property. The addition and renovations have been contemplated by the Applicants for a very long time.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 8.</P1></P>
<P>9. The Applicants purchased [location omitted] 2001, as a newly married couple. The house on [location omitted] [location omitted] was originally built in approximately 1923.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 9.</P1></P>
<P>10. [location omitted]has sentimental value for the Applicants, as it was the first home they purchased together and it is where all of their three children have grown up. It is also located in the neighbourhood in which all of the Applicant's friends live and where their children's friends live. The Applicants have looked at other homes in Toronto in an attempt to address living space requirements for their growing family, however, they have always decided to stay at [location omitted] [location omitted].
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 12.</P1></P>
<P>11. The Applicants have three children. Since the Applicants' family has grown, the living space limitations of [location omitted]have become more and more apparent.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 13.</P1></P>
<P>12. Currently, the house has three bedrooms. The Applicants share a bedroom and their daughter has her own bedroom. The Applicants' sons, ages twelve and sixteen, currently have to share a bedroom.
<P1>- Cross-examination transcript of Drew Keith Allen on February 12, 2019 (the &ldquo;Allen Cross&rdquo;), p. 24, qs. 229&ndash;233.</P1></P>
<P>13. In contemplation of addressing the limitations of the home, the Applicants met with a number of different house builders over the years to discuss potential renovations, engaged an architectural technologist to prepare some plans for consideration, and viewed many other properties in the Moore Park, Leaside, Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill neighbourhoods. As time goes on, the cost of purchasing properties as well as the cost to renovate continues to steadily escalate in the GTA.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraphs 21-22.</P1></P>
<P>14. The Applicants are now in a financial position to proceed with their long-discussed renovation plans.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraphs 25-26.</P1></P>
<P>15. After considering a number of potential architectural design candidates, the Applicants retained the architectural firm of Spragge &amp; Company Architects Ltd. (&ldquo;Spragge &amp; Company&rdquo;) in April 2017 to prepare plans for an addition and renovation to the house.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 28.</P1></P>
<P>16. The Applicants intended to keep as much of the original house as possible and to re -build an addition at the rear of the house in order to try to stay within the size limitations imposed by the City of Toronto By-laws for their lot size and to maintain the look of the house for the benefit of the neighbourhood.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 29.</P1></P>
<P>17. The Applicants and the architect took into account the Tree with respect to the Applicants' renovation plans and they tried to formulate building plans which would meet their needs while preserving the Tree, if at all reasonably possible.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 30.</P1></P>
<P>18. The Applicants asked Spragge &amp; Company whether they would be able to devise a plan which preserves the Tree. However, Spragge &amp; Company was not able to come up with a possible and reasonable plan which would allow the Applicants to preserve the Tree.
<P1>- Allen Cross, p. 32, qs. 214-215.</P1></P>
<P>19. In order to accommodate the Applicants' family living and activity needs, the design prepared by Spragge &amp; Company contemplates adding approximately 1,300 sq. ft. to the existing structure, increasing the gross floor space from approximately 2,400 sq. ft. to 3,700 sq. ft., and repurposing some of the existing space to make it more functional and efficient. Based on other renovation/addition projects that are typically undertaken in the Moore Park neighbourhood with older homes, the size of the addition contemplated by the Applicants is typical of the neighbourhood and the Applicants felt it would be in line with the space requirements to meet their five-person family needs. To be able to accommodate this additional space, the design logically calls for moving the basement foundation walls further towards the rear of[location omitted]
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 31.</P1></P>
<P>20. As the Tree is in very close proximity to the current rear foundation wall of[location omitted]and it and its supporting root structure would be in the direct path of excavation necessary to make the Applicants' proposed renovation achievable, the design calls for the removal of the Tree. If the Tree is preserved, then no addition to the house can be accomplished because any addition, by its very nature, would have to be built on the Tree's existing roots.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 34.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Approval of the Committee of Adjustment</EM></TI>
<P>21. In order to implement the design of the addition and renovation, Spragge &amp; Company made an application on behalf of the Applicants to the Committee of Adjustment in August 2017 to consider approval of minor variances required by the proposed plans.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraphs 35-36, 38, Exhibits &ldquo;D&rdquo; - &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>22. Allen met with the Respondents in mid-December 2017 to advise them of the Applicants' intentions with respect to the proposed renovation and that, regrettably, the renovation plan could not be carried out without seriously impacting the Tree and the Applicants expected they would not be able to preserve the Tree.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 40.</P1></P>
<P>23. The Respondents responded to the Applicants shortly thereafter claiming that they considered the Tree a boundary tree, and that their right to consent was therefore required for the Applicants to be able to remove the Tree. The Respondents advised that they would not consent to such removal and that this was not a negotiable position.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 41, Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>24. The Respondents made written submissions to the Committee of Adjustment indicating that, while they did not oppose the planned renovation itself, they wished to voice their claim that the Tree was jointly owned by them and that they would not consent to the Tree being removed.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 42, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>25. On January 24, 2018, the Committee of Adjustment reviewed the written submissions and heard the oral submissions of Spragge &amp; Company on behalf of the Applicants, as well as the submissions of the Respondents and a neighbour backing on to the Respondents' property. The Committee subsequently granted the Applicants' request for the minor variances despite the Respondents' submissions.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 43, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>26. The Respondents did not appeal the decision of the Committee of Adjustment. As such, the decision of the Committee of Adjustment is final and binding.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 44, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Approval of Toronto Urban Forestry</EM></TI>
<P>27. The Applicants engaged Arborvalley Urban Forestry Co. (&ldquo;Arborvalley&rdquo;) as a consultant to address anticipated tree issues in connection with their renovation. Arborvalley made an application of behalf of the Applicants to the City of Toronto, Parks, Forestry &amp; Recreation Division, Urban Forestry Branch (&ldquo;Toronto Urban Forestry&rdquo;) on December 28, 2017 for a permit to destroy the Tree.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 45, Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>28. As a precondition to issuance of the permit allowing the Tree to be remove d, the Applicants were required to erect and submit photographs to Toronto Urban Forestry of Tree Protection Zone hoarding, submit a replacement tree planting plan for approval by Toronto Urban Forestry, and pay a fee in lieu of planting one of three required replacement trees.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraphs 46-47, Exhibits &ldquo;K&rdquo; - &ldquo;L&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>29. On March 22, 2018, Toronto Urban Forestry wrote a letter to the Applicants to advise that their application for a permit to destroy the Tree was approved, stating:
<QUOTE><P>Urban Forestry has reviewed this application, including performing an independent assessment of the subject tree. Approval of any application to remove a tree is based upon our assessment that no reasonable alternatives to tree removal are possible and the tree qualifies for removal under the By-law. Your application meets our requirements, and the permit will be issued as early as 15 calendar days from the receipt of this letter.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 49, Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>30. The Applicants signed an undertaking on April 19, 2018 in favour of Toronto Urban Forestry undertaking to abide by all conditions related to the issuing of the tree destruction permit, including not destroying any tree prior to receipt of a permit for the project.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 48, Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>- Allen Cross, p. 44, q. 306.</P1></P>
<P>31. Toronto Urban Forestry issued permit no.

<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 52.</P1></P>
<P>34. On June 20, 2018 the City of Toronto issued to the Applicants two building permits for the addition and renovation being: building permit 18 157345 PLB 00 PS; and, building permit 18 157345 BLD 00 SR (collectively, the &ldquo;Building Permits&rdquo;). Both Building Permits are based upon the destruction of the Tree to complete the addition and renovation.

<P>35. The Tree is preventing the Applicants from building the addition and renovation they require for their family. The Tree is one of five mature and very large trees on [location omitted], all of which provide abundant shade and canopy to both [location omitted] and [location omitted]. Under the Tree Destruction Permit, the Applicants are obligated to plant two replacement trees, which is a small part of a landscaping plan involving the planting of numerous additional plants, shrubs, and trees once the renovation is completed.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit. Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 55.</P1></P>
<P>36. The Applicants have taken no action to injure or destroy the Tree but have attempted to comply with all legal requirements and take every reasonable step to diligently advance their renovation project.

<P>37. The Respondents retained an arborist, Philip van Wassenaer (&ldquo;van Wassenaer&rdquo;), to prepare a report providing opinion evidence pertaining to the dispute between the Respondents and the Applicants with respect to the nature and benefit of the Tree, as well as the Applicants' ability to develop their property while preserving the tree. Some of the opinions of van Wassenaer are beyond his area of expertise as an arborist.
<P1>- Affidavit of Philip van Wassenaer sworn on January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;Van Wassenaer Affidavit), Responding Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 3.</P1></P>
<P>38. Van Wassenaer prepared his report dated January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;Van Wassenaer Report&rdquo;).
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Affidavit, Responding Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 4, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>39. The Toronto Strategic Forest Management Plan applies to all the trees in the City of Toronto, which includes those in the Moore Park area and, specifically, applies to the Tree at [location omitted] and [location omitted]. As such, Toronto Urban Forestry followed the objectives of the Strategic Forest Management Plan of increasing canopy cover, achieving equitable distribution, increasing biodiversity, increasing awareness, promoting stewardship, and improving monitoring when assessing whether to issue the Tree Destruction Permit. After considering all these objectives and reviewing the circumstances surrounding the Tree, physically inspecting the Tree, and reviewing the Applicants proposed renovation plans, Toronto Urban Forestry determined that it was reasonable to permit the destruction of the Tree.
<P1>- Cross-examination transcript of Philip van Wassenaer on February 13, 2019 (the &ldquo;Van Wassenaer Cross), p. 32, q. 163.</P1></P>
<P>40. Van Wassenaer noted that although he was familiar with the policies under the Toronto Strategic Forest Management Plan to be applied by Toronto Urban Forestry in assessing whether to issue a tree destruction permit, he indicated that he was not aware of whether such processes and policies were followed in assessing and issuing the Tree Destruction Permit to the Applicants. It is submitted that rather than being an impartial expert witness, van Wassenaer has acted as an advocate in this matter. When it was put to him that it was more probable than not that Toronto Urban Forestry considered the impact of removal the Tree would have on shade, energy savings, air quality, animal habitat, storm water reduction, and the entire urban forest; van Wassenaer (despite being put forward as an expert urban arborist) claimed he did not know what the Toronto Urban Forestry inspector took into account. Rather than admitting what is patently obvious as to what any inspector would take into account in determining whether to issue a permit to destroy any tree; van Wassenaer claimed he did not know how Toronto Urban Forestry inspectors make assessments. Van Wassenaer did admit that there was no evidence to suggest that in determining to issue the Tree Destruction Permit that Toronto Urban Forestry did not follow its own policies. If there is no evidence to suggest that Toronto Urban Forestry did not follow its own policies and it is known that the Tree Destruction Permit was issued, then Toronto Urban Forestry made an objective assessment pursuant to the Strategic Forest Management Plan to issue the Tree Destruction Permit.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 31-32, 42, qs. 158&ndash;163, 195&ndash;208.</P1></P>
<P>41. In addition, the Van Wassenaer Report specifically states the following with respect to the preservation of the Tree (referred to in the Van Wassenaer Report as Tree #5):
<QUOTE><P>It is my professional opinion that the current design has ignored the preservation requirements of Tree #5. There are many different design opportunities which would allow For a significant addition to be built at [location omitted]while respecting the preservation requirements of Tree #5. The applicants have many development configurations available to them that do not further extend the existing foundation of their home into the TPZ [Tree Protection Zone] of Tree #5.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Affidavit, Responding Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 4, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;, page 11.</P1></P>
<P>42. However, on cross-examination, van Wassenaer stated that he is not aware of the specifics of any alternative design options which would be available to the Applicants which would allow them to preserve the Tree, as the formulation of these designs are outside of the scope of his expertise.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 51, 55- 60, 62, qs. 238, 268&ndash;288, 292.</P1></P>
<P>43. Van Wassnenaer admitted that, although he believed alternative design options could exist, that such options may not provide what the Applicants are seeking. He also admitted that such alternatives may not be compliant with existing by-laws because he is not a land surveyor, architect, or municipal planner.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 6-7, 60, qs. 15&ndash;24, 288.</P1></P>
<P>44. For example, the permissible length of a house is 17 metres long pursuant to the applicable City of Toronto by-laws. The Applicants' renovation plan proposed a length of 17.77 metres long. This is why a minor variance was required from the Committee of Adjustment. Van Wassenaer states that there is a 6.24 metre tree protection zone surrounding the Tree under Toronto by-laws. He opined that no foundation could be excavated within the tree protection zone without resulting in a risk of damage to the Tree. When van Wassenaer was asked whether he had considered the impact of the tree protection zone along with the 1.22 metre side set backs on either side of[location omitted]upon the increased required length of the house to achieve the same square meterage sought by the Applicants in their proposed renovation plans, van Wassenaer admitted that such an alternative design may not be permissible under the applicable by-laws, as the house length would have to be increased significantly beyond 17.77 metres to accommodate a smaller width.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 52, 54, 58, 59, qs. 246&ndash;249, 256, 260-261, 279, 284.</P1></P>
<P>45. Despite the above scenario having been put to van Wassenaer on cross-examination, he reiterated that he believed there to be a number of alternative design plans, but that he was not aware of the specifics of such alternatives as the design of same are outside of the scope of his expertise.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 60, 62, qs. 286&ndash;288, 292.</P1></P>
<P>46. Further, the Respondent MacDougall also admitted on cross-examination that she is not aware of the specifics of any alternative renovation plan which would preserve the Tree. She also indicated that the Respondents have not taken any steps to retain a qualified party to prepare an actual design which would allow for a renovation to the Applicants' home taking into account the 6.24 metre tree protection zone.

<P>52. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hartley v. Cunningham</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Moore J., who determined on the application that the definition of &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; within the context of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM>, should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning. The Court of Appeal defined trunk:
<QUOTE><P>It is that part of the tree from its point of growth away from its roots up to where it branches out to limbs and foliage. There are no words in the statute that limit the meaning to the &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; at ground level.</P></QUOTE>

<P>53. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hartley v.

<P>54. However, in <CASEREF><SOC>Freedman v. Cooper</SOC></CASEREF>, Perell J. held that the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> did not apply where the boundary tree constituted a nuisance. In that case, the owner of a property could not obtain the consent of the neighbouring owner to cut down a boundary tree on the properties. As such, Freedman sought an order allowing her to remove the boundary tree, being concerned that without consent from her neighbour, she might be charged under section 10(3) of the <EM>Act</EM> for cutting down the boundary tree. Perell J. concluded that section 10(3) of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> did not apply under these circumstances, but rather the common law applied. Perell J. applied the common law tort of nuisance, finding that the boundary tree between the properties constituted a nuisance, and as such, Freedman had the right to abate the nuisance by removing the tree.

<QUOTE><P>Under the law of nuisance, property owners are entitled to resort to self-help remedies to eliminate a <BOLD><EM>continuing nuisance caused by roots and branches from trees</EM></BOLD>, or the court may order that the nuisance by abated or removed. (Emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>

<P>56. Perell J.'s decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Freedman v. Cooper</SOC></CASEREF> was recently followed by Ricchetti J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC></CASEREF>, wherein Ricchetti J. held:
<QUOTE><P>Accordingly, if the &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; cedars were a nuisance, the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> continues to specify that the boundary tree(s) is jointly owned but the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> does not prohibit a party from taking self-help (or seek a judicial declaration to this effect) where the boundary tree constitutes a nuisance and one co-owner has refused to consent to its removal. In this case the learned trial judge found that the cedars constituted a nuisance and the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> &ldquo;does not apply in this case&rdquo;. Having found that the cedars constituted a nuisance, the trial judge's conclusion by the learned trial judge is consistent with the applicable legal authorities.</P></QUOTE>

<P>57. Ricchetti J. further held:

<P>58. As such, if a boundary tree constitutes a nuisance to one of the co-owners of the tree, consent pursuant to section 10(3) of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> is not required for the removal of the tree.</P>
<P>59. In the present case, the Tree is currently growing on both[location omitted]and[location omitted] As such, as held by Ricchetti J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v.

However, further to the decisions in both <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Freedman v. Cooper</SOC></CASEREF>, if the Tree is held to constitute a nuisance to the Applicants, section 10(3) of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> does not prohibit the Applicants from taking steps to abate the nuisance by removing the Tree where the Respondents continue to refuse to provide their consent.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Nuisance</EM></TI>
<P>60. According to the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC></CASEREF>, for there to be a nuisance, there must be an interference with a property owner's use and enjoyment of their property and such interference must be substantial and unreasonable:
<QUOTE><P>The elements of a claim in private nuisance have often been expressed in terms of a two-part test of this nature: to support a claim in private nuisance the interference with the owner's use or enjoyment of land must be both <EM>substantial</EM> and <EM>unreasonable</EM>. A substantial interference with property is one that is non-trivial. Where this threshold is met, the inquiry proceeds to the reasonableness analysis, which is concerned with whether the non-trivial interference was also unreasonable in all of the circumstances.</P></QUOTE>

<P>61. In <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC></CASEREF>, the appellants argued that boundary trees should only constitute a nuisance if there is imminent danger of damage being caused, damage has been actually caused, or in cases of emergency. Ricchetti J., however, held that there was no reason to impose such a special category limiting common law nuisance in the context of boundary trees and that the normal test for nuisance applied.

<P>62. Ricchetti J. further held that the existing cedars on the boundary line between the respondent's property and the appellant's adjoining property constituted a substantial interference, as the cedars prevented the respondents from constructing a fence in their backyard for the safety of a six-year old child living at the respondent's property without losing approximately six to eight feet of their backyard. The position, angles, and size of the cedars contributed to the substantial and unreasonable nature of the interference with the respondent's full use and enjoyment of his property, as the respondent &ldquo;had every right [...] to use his property for the safety and enjoyment of the 6 year old child&rdquo;. Similarly, the Applicants wish to have the full use and enjoyment of their property by constructing an addition which has been approved by the granting of building permits and by the Committee of Adjustment. The Tree is causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with the Applicants' full use and enjoyment of[location omitted]

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Substantial Interference</EM></TI>
<P>63. In <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC></CASEREF>, Cromwell J. described the threshold of substantial interference as follows:
<QUOTE><P>What does this threshold require? In <EM>Barette</EM>, the Court noted that the requirement of substantial harm &ldquo;means that compensation will not be awarded for trivial annoyances&rdquo;: para 77. In <EM>St. Pierre</EM>, while the Court was careful to say that the categories of nuisance are not closed, it also noted that only interferences that &ldquo;<UNDER>substantially</UNDER> alte[r] the nature of the claimant's property itself&rdquo; or interfere &ldquo;to a <UNDER>significant</UNDER> extent with the actual use being made of the property are sufficient to ground a claim in nuisance: p. 915 (emphasis added). One can ascertain from these authorities that a substantial injury to the complainant's property interest is one that amounts to more than a slight annoyance or trifling interference. As La Forest J. put it in <CASEREF><SOC>Tock v. St. John's (City) Metropolitan Area Board</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 1181</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, actionable nuisances include &ldquo;only those inconveniences that materially interfere with ordinary comfort as defined according to the standards held by those of plain and sober tastes&rdquo;, and not claims based &ldquo;on the prompting of excessive &lsquo;delicacy and fastidiousness&rsquo;&rdquo;: p. 1191. Claims that are clearly of this latter nature do not engage the reasonableness analysis.</P>
<P>In referring to these statements I do not mean to suggest that there are firm categories of types of interference which determine whether an interference is or is not actionable, a point I will discuss in more detail later. Nuisance may take a variety of forms and may include not only actual physical damage to land but also interference with the health, comfort or convenience of the owner or occupier: <EM>Tock</EM>, at pp. 1190-91. The point is not that there is a typology of actionable interferences; the point is rather that there is a threshold of seriousness that must be met before an interference is actionable.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC><CITE>2013 CarswellOnt 2354</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (McLachlin C.J.C., LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner J.J.) at paras 22-23, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 4.</P1></P>
<P>64. As such, <EM>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd</EM>., identifies substantial interference as one which interferes significantly with the use made of the property and is not just a &ldquo;trifling interference&rdquo;. The Supreme Court of Canada acknowledges that nuisance may include an interference to the comfort and convenience of the property owner or occupier.</P>
<P>65. The Tree is a substantial interference with the Applicants' use and enjoyment of their property. Since purchasing [location omitted], the Applicants' family has grown from two to five members. The Applicants seek to undertake the proposed renovations to improve the space occupied by their family, and to accommodate their everyday lives at [location omitted] given their increased family size.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 8, 13, 31.</P1></P>
<P>66. There is no other feasible opportunity for the addition to be completed without the removal of the Tree. The Applicants have inquired of their architect, Spragge &amp; Company, as to whether their proposed renovation goals could be met while preserving the Tree, however, they have been advised by Spragge &amp; Company that no reasonable such plans can be devised to do so. The only acceptable renovation plan available to the Applicants requires the removal of the Tree.
<P1>- Allen Cross, p. 32, qs. 214-215.</P1>
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraphs 30, 34.</P1></P>
<P>67. Although the Respondents have taken the position that there are alternative design options available to the Applicants which preserve the Tree, they have provided no evidence to support this assertion. In addition, van Wassenaer admitted on cross-examination that he was not aware of the specifics of any such alternative plan and that alternative plans could be limited due to the applicable municipal by-laws.

<P1>- MacDougall Cross, p. 36, 53-54, qs. 195-196, 284&ndash;287.</P1></P>
<P>68. The presence of the Tree continues to prevent the Applicants from fully using and enjoying [location omitted] given their increased family by completing the approved addition.</P>
<P>69. Further, due to the age of the home, these renovations would not only allow the home to be brought up to modem living standards to accommodate the family's needs, but also to realize the home's foil property value. If the Applicants are prevented from moving forward with their renovation plans, they will not be able to realize the home's foil market value if it were to be sold in its current state.
<P1>- Allen Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, paragraph 12.</P1></P>
<P>70. The Tree constitutes a substantial interference as described by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd</EM>., as it significantly interferes with the Applicants' ability to use their property in a manner which accommodates the needs of their family. It continues to drastically affect the comfort and convenience of the Applicants and their family by preventing the realization of the foil functionality and space their property could provide and as permitted by the Committee of Adjustment. Due to the presence of a substantial interference, the Applicants' case passes the threshold stage of the nuisance analysis.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Unreasonableness</EM></TI>
<P>71. The Supreme Court of Canada described how the &ldquo;unreasonableness&rdquo; portion of the test for nuisance is to be applied in <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[...] As in other private nuisance cases, the reasonableness of the interference must be assessed in light of all of the relevant circumstances. The focus of that balancing exercise, however, is on whether the interference is such that it would be unreasonable in all of the circumstances to require the claimant to suffer it without compensation.</P>
<P>In the traditional law of private nuisance, the courts assess, in broad terms, whether the interference is unreasonable by balancing the gravity of the harm against the utility of the defendant's conduct in all of the circumstances [...] The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal identified several factors that have often been referred to in assessing whether a substantial interference is also unreasonable. In relation to the gravity of the harm, the courts have considered factors such as the severity of the interference, the character of the neighbourhood and the sensitivity of the plaintiff [...] The frequency and duration of an interference may also be relevant in some cases. [...]</P></QUOTE>

<P>72. The Supreme Court of Canada does, however, caution that these factors are not a checklist, and are only some of the criteria to be reviewed with respect to the tort of nuisance.

<P>73. The Supreme Court further clarifies that the focus is on the unreasonableness of the interference, and not on whether the defendant's conduct is unreasonable. However, the conduct of a defendant is not an irrelevant consideration, particularly where such conduct is malicious or careless.
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC><CITE>2013 CarswellOnt 2354</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (McLachlin C.J.C., LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner J.J.) at para 28, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 4.</P1></P>
<P>74. Another relevant factor identified in <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC></CASEREF> for consideration with respect to private nuisance is the duration of the interference, stating:
<QUOTE><P>While temporary interferences may certainly support a claim in nuisance in some circumstances, interferences that persist for a prolonged period of time will be more likely to attract a remedy [...]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</SOC><CITE>2013 CarswellOnt 2354</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (McLachlin C.J.C., LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner J.J.) at para 42, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 4.</P1></P>
<P>75. In the present case, the interference of the Tree upon the Applicants' use and enjoyment of their property is unreasonable. Firstly, if the Tree is not permitted to be removed, the Applicants will continue to suffer this substantial interference on an indefinite basis while they own the property. Unless the Tree is removed, the Applicants will never be able to attain the functionality and space they require to meet the needs of their family at [location omitted]and build the addition which has been approved by the City of Toronto Building Department, the Committee of Adjustment, and Toronto Urban Forestry. Further, the Applicants will never be able to realize the full market value of their property. The permanent and ongoing nature of the interference upon the Applicants is entirely unreasonable.

<P>76. A further consideration is a balancing of the extent of the harm against the Applicants against the effect of removing the Tree causing the nuisance. As noted above, the harm imposed upon the Applicants is significant and such harm outweighs the effect of the removal of the Tree. The Respondents have noted that they derive benefits from the Tree, including shade and cooling effects upon their home. However, these benefits do not outweigh the effect imposed upon the Applicants if they continue to be unable to undertake their renovation to meet the needs of their family, as it impacts the Applicants' ability to fully use and enjoy their property.

<P1>- MacDougall Cross, p. 41&ndash;43, qs. 224&ndash;233.</P1></P>
<P>77. It is submitted that in issuing the Tree Destruction Permit, Toronto Urban Forestry engaged in an objective analysis, after physically inspecting the Tree, to determine whether the Tree should be removed. In reaching its decision, Toronto Urban Forestry evaluated the criteria set out in the Strategic Forest Management Plan. After engaging in this analysis, Toronto Urban Forestry concluded that the renovations could not allow for the preservation of the Tree and it approved of the Tree's removal.
<P1>- Van Wassenaer Cross, p. 31-32, 42, qs. 158&ndash;163, 195&ndash;208.</P1></P>
<P>78. As stated by Ricchetti J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC></CASEREF>, the interference need not cause imminent danger, have caused actual damage, or cause emergency circumstances in order for a tree to be a nuisance. Ricchetti J. concluded that the inability to use a property owner's backyard in a manner in a way desired by the property owner was a nuisance caused by a tree. Similarly the Tree causes an unreasonable interference to the Applicants' ability to use and enjoy their property and, as such, is a nuisance.

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Removal of the Tree</EM></TI>
<P>79. It is well-established at common law that property owners are entitled to resort to self-help remedies to eliminate a nuisance caused by tree branches or roots growing from an adjoining property. In <CASEREF><SOC>Graham v. Da Silva</SOC></CASEREF>, McDermid Co. Ct. J. (as he then was) held that Da Silva was entitled to remove a branch leaning over his property, although the tree was growing entirely on Graham's neighbouring property. The removal of the overhanging branch caused the tree to split down into the trunk, resulting in the need for the entire tree to be removed. McDermid Co. Ct. J., (as he then was), further determined that it was of no consequence that Da Silva ultimately had to cut down the entire tree, and that Da Silva was entitled to do so in order to abate the nuisance.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Graham v. Da Silva</SOC><CITE>1984 CarswellOnt 603</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. Co. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (McDermid Co. Ct. J.) at paras 5-6, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 5.</P1></P>
<P>80. The decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Graham v. Da Silva</SOC></CASEREF> was followed by Arbour J., (as she then was), in <CASEREF><SOC>Centrum Land Corporation v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario et al</SOC></CASEREF>. In that case, the defendant wished to expand the building on their property and in order to do so, would need to remove a number of trees which grew along the boundary line with the plaintiff's neighbouring property. The defendant had obtained a building permit for the addition. Centrum sought a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from destroying the trees.
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Centrum Land Corporation v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario et al.</SOC><CITE>1988 CarswellOnt 193</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. H.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Arbour J.) at paras 1, 3, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 6.</P1></P>
<P>81. Arbour J. concluded that the defendant was entitled to remove the trees on the basis that they were a nuisance which prevented it from being able to move forward with the addition. In reaching this decision, Arbour J. stated:
<QUOTE><P>[...] A tree that encroaches on that boundary line may become a nuisance to the adjacent owner. In such case, at common law, the owner would be entitled to take measures to suppress that nuisance. [...]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Centrum Land Corporation v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario et al.</SOC><CITE>1988 CarswellOnt 193</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. H.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Arbour J.) at para 9, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 6.</P1></P>
<P>82. In following the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Graham v. Da Silva</SOC></CASEREF> and permitting the removal of the trees, Arbour J. stated:
<QUOTE><P>[...] It would seem to me to be a fair analysis of the problem in this case to examine the situation that the institute would be in if the trees which will be affected by its construction project were entirely on Centrum's land. To put it another way, I would have thought that Centrum could have no greater right in the trees on the boundary line than it would have if the trees were completely on its land.</P>
<P>If this were the case, the institute would clearly be entitled, in my opinion, to remove any branches or roots of such trees which interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of its property, including the right to build on it within an inch of the boundary line. [...] If the tree is so close to the boundary line that the cutting back of the offending branches or roots is likely to jeopardize the ability of the tree to survive the cut, I was referred to no authority which suggests that the adjacent owner must then suffer the nuisance. I agree with the disposition of <CASEREF><SOC>Graham v. Da Silva</SOC></CASEREF> which imposed no such limitations in similar circumstances.</P>
<P>It goes without saying that if the trees in this case were located entirely on the institute's land, they could be removed by the institute despite their shade and ornamental value to the plaintiff's tenant. If the trees were located entirely on Centrum's land, the institute could remove any part of them which would interfere with its construction plans. Absent the provisions of the <EM>Trees Act</EM>, which clearly do not apply in this case, I cannot see how the situation can be different merely because the trees happen to grow on the boundary line.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>- <CASEREF><SOC>Centrum Land Corporation v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario et al.</SOC><CITE>1988 CarswellOnt 193</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. H.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Arbour J.) at paras 20&ndash;22, Book of Authorities of the Applicant, Tab 6.</P1></P>
<P>83. The facts in <EM>Centrum Land Corporation</EM> are completely analogous to those in the present case. The Applicants wish to undergo a renovation which includes the construction of an addition to their property. The Tree prohibits the Applicants from being able to move forward with the renovation. As in <EM>Centrum Land Corporation</EM>, the Applicants have obtained the appropriate Building Permits and Tree Destruction Permit. Further, the <EM>Trees Act</EM> (the predecessor of the <EM>Forestry Act</EM>) did not have any application in <EM>Centrum Land Corporation</EM> and Arbour J. relied upon the common law in determining that the defendants could remove the trees.</P>
<P>84. Following the holding of Arbour J., the Applicants would be able to abate the nuisance caused by the Tree by cutting any roots or branches which affected the Applicants' property or proposed renovation if the trunk of the Tree was entirely situated on the Respondents' property. At common law, they could do this without the Respondents consent. If the trunk was entirely situated on the Applicants' property, then they could abate the nuisance without the Respondents consent. The Applicants should not be prevented from being able to abate the nuisance caused to them by the Tree solely because the Tree is located on the boundary line between their property and that of the Respondents. No case has ever held this and, in fact, Arbour J. held the complete opposite in <EM>Centrum Land Corporation</EM>.</P>
<P>85. Given that the <EM>Forestry Act</EM> does not apply to require the consent of the Respondents due to the nuisance caused by the Tree, the Applicants are entitled to take steps to abate such nuisance by removing the Tree in order to proceed with their renovation plans.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Applicants, Drew Allen and Susan Byrne, and the Respondents, Meghan MacDougall and Nigel Scott, are neighbours in the Moore Park neighbourhood of Toronto. The Applicants assert that they should be permitted to destroy the Respondents' property in order to enhance the value of their own.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of the Cross-Examination of Drew Allen, February 12, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Allen Transcript</BOLD>&rdquo;), P. 37 QQ. 256&ndash;259, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The property at issue, a large Norway Maple (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Maple</BOLD>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<BOLD>Tree</BOLD>&rdquo;), is a boundary tree that straddles the property line between the Respondents' and the Applicants' properties. As such, the Maple is co-owned by both sets of neighbours. The Applicants acknowledge that the Tree is co-owned and that the Respondents possess a property interest in the Tree. But the Applicants are intent on building a 1300-square-foot addition to their home, and they do not believe that inconveniences such as other people's property rights should get in their way.</P>
<P>2. The Respondents do not oppose the Applicants renovating their home. The Respondents ask only that the Applicants pursue their renovations in a manner that preserves the Maple&mdash;an integral part of the Respondents' home and one of the reasons they purchased it in the first place.</P>
<P>3. Rather than alter their renovation plans and attempt to reach a good-faith compromise with the Respondents that preserves the Tree, the Applicants come to this Court and ask it to declare the Maple a nuisance. This Court ought to decline their invitation.</P>
<P>4. The Applicants mischaracterize the Maple as an impediment to improving their home. The Maple does not affect renovations within Applicants' existing residence or prevent them from resolving the &ldquo;practical issues&rdquo; they describe in their affidavit evidence. The Maple impacts only the Applicants' plan for a walkout basement, which is part of their 1300-square-foot addition to the home. The Respondents' expert, Philip van Wassenaer, an experienced consulting arborist, provided evidence that the Applicants' proposed renovation and the Maple can coexist if the Applicants reduce the contemplated below-grade excavation to one side of their property.</P>
<P>5. The existence of a large and healthy Maple in a neighbourhood renowned for its tree canopy is not a nuisance. There is no risk of harm or damage to the Applicants or their property. The Applicants can <EM>substantially</EM> improve and enlarge their home with the Maple intact. They are simply required to do so in a way that differs from their current plans. The Applicants may feel that exploring alternative design options is inconvenient, but living in an urban neighbourhood (or in any society) requires respect for other people's property rights. This Court ought not condone the Applicants' exceptionalism. The Application should be dismissed with costs.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Background</TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Parties</EM></TI>
<P>6. The Respondents Meghan MacDougall and Nigel Scott, have owned and resided at the property municipally known as [location omitted] since 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Meghan MacDougall dated January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>MacDougall Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;) at para. 2, Respondents Application Record (&ldquo;<BOLD>RAR</BOLD>&rdquo;), Tab 1, pp. 1-2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Their next-door neighbours, the Applicants Susan Byrne and Drew Allen, own and reside at the adjacent property to the south, [location omitted].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 3, RAR, Tab 1, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Maple grows on the southern boundary line between the [location omitted] and creates a natural barrier between the two properties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 4, RAR, Tab 1, p. 2; Survey of[location omitted]dated April 28, 2016, McDougall Affidavit, Exhibit C, RAR, Tab 1, p. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Evidence on this Application</EM></TI>
<P>7. Drew Allen, one of the Applicants, swore an affidavit dated August 30, 2018 and attended cross-examination on February 12, 2019. Meghan MacDougall, one of the Respondents, swore an affidavit dated January 8, 2019 and attended cross-examination on February 26, 2019. Neither Mr. Allen nor Ms. MacDougall is or purports to be an expert in matters of architecture, engineering, arboriculture, or urban planning.</P>
<P>8. There is only one source of expert evidence on this Application, in the form of the affidavit of Philip van Wassenaer and his accompanying report dated January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>van Wassenaer Report</BOLD>&rdquo;). Mr. van Wassenaer attended cross-examination on February 13, 2019.</P>
<P>9. Mr. van Wassenaer is an expert in the areas of arboriculture and urban forestry with over 28 years of experience.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Arborist Report&mdash;<CASEREF><SOC>Allen-Byrne v. MacDougall-Scott</SOC></CASEREF> dated January 8, 2019, (the &ldquo;<BOLD>van Wassenaer Report</BOLD>&rdquo;) at p. 2, Affidavit Philip van Wassenaer sworn January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>van Wassenaer Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), Exhibit B, RAR, Tab 2B, p. 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He was a practising arborist for ten years, during which time he undertook a full range of arboricultural operations commonly employed in urban areas. Since 1999, he has been continuously employed as a consulting urban forester and consulting arborist. Mr. van Wassenaer's role as a consulting arborist requires him to be aware of engineering, architecture, and landscape architecture and their impact on trees. His projects often require him to work with engineers and architects to determine how a tree can be preserved in building projects.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of the Cross-Examination of Philip van Wassenaer, February 13, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>van Wassenaer Transcript</BOLD>&rdquo;), PP. 50-51, QQ. 237, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. The Applicants did not respond to the van Wassenaer Report. They have tendered no evidence, expert or otherwise, from their architect, Tom Spragge, or either of their arborists, Adam Vandermeij and Mark Procunier. Nor have they put forward evidence regarding the practices of Toronto Urban Forestry, either generally or in the specific circumstances of this case.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Applicants Ignored the Respondents' Request To Preserve the Tree</TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Maple Is an Important Feature of the Respondents' Home</EM></TI>
<P>11. The Maple is valuable to the Respondents and integral to their home. According to Ms. MacDougall, who by profession is a conservationist with the W. Garfield Weston Foundation with a degree in Wildlife Biology and Natural Resources Management,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of the Cross-Examination of Meghan MacDougall, February 26, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>MacDougall Transcript</BOLD>&rdquo;), P. 3, Q. 5; P. 5, Q. 20, Transcript Brief, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> she and her family consider the stewardship of their trees, generally, to be an important responsibility in the care of their property, community, and the environment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 7, RAR, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. After moving to Canada in 2014, the Respondents decided to move to Moore Park in large part because of its greenery, mature tree canopy, and proximity to the Moore Park Ravine and the Evergreen Brickworks.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at para. 10, RAR p. 3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They are not alone in their impression of the neighbourhood. Louise Lang, the parties' neighbour to the west, comments in a letter, &ldquo;One of the biggest attractions of Moore Park is the large trees, especially the &lsquo;Century&rsquo; or &lsquo;Granddaddy&rsquo; trees. These large trees of Moore Park add significantly to the quality of life in this neighbourhood for the shade and aesthetic beauty they provide.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter form Louise Lang dated November 26, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Lang Letter</BOLD>&rdquo;), MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit H, RAR, p. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. The Respondents' home, [location omitted], embodies the characteristics that drew them to the neighbourhood. They were especially attracted to its backyard. It is relatively large for a city plot and has enough space to entertain outdoors and for then son to play. The Maple was one of the things the Respondents liked most about [location omitted] at the time they purchased the property in the summer of 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 7, RAR, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The canopy provided by the Tree was and remains essential to the shade and aesthetic of the yard,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 10, RAR, p. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which the Respondents have designed to serve as their primary living space during the summer months.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 7, RAR, p. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. The Applicants state in their factum that the Maple is but one of five large trees that provides shade and canopy to [location omitted].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' factum, para. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This statement is misleading. While there are four other mature trees on [location omitted], these provide shade only to the bottom of the Respondents' garden and their shed, and do not contribute significant shade to their property.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 8, RAR, p. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Moreover, those trees are not the Respondents' property.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. A neighbour, Ms. Lang, describes the Maple's canopy as &ldquo;truly a magnificent sight.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Lang Letter, MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit H, RAR, p. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Another neighbour, Michael Bertouche, advises, &ldquo;I believe the beauty of Moore Park and the tree canopy is special and valuable to this community and needs to be preserved.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter of Michael Bertouche dated January 5, 2019 (&ldquo;Bertouche Letter&rdquo;), MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit 1, RAR p. 37.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He adds, &ldquo;I am hopeful that the tree will remain in place at the end of this process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ibid.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, the Director of the Moore Park Residents' Association, Jeremy Gawen, notes that the Maple &ldquo;is very large and appears to be in excellent condition and we would not wish it to be either damaged or removed.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter of Jeremy Gawen dated November 19, 2019 [<EM>sic</EM>] (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Gawen Letter</BOLD>&rdquo;), MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit G, RAR p. 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Maple Holds Real Value for the Applicants</EM></TI>
<P>16. The Maple is a vibrant and healthy tree and objectively valuable. The Tree generates numerous benefits for [location omitted] and its surroundings.</P>
<P>17. As set out more fully in his report, Mr. van Wassenaer appraised the Maple using the Trunk Formula Method.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 7, RAR, p. 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This technique calculates a tree's value as a function of, among other things, its size, condition, species, location, and the cost of installation. On this basis, Mr. van Wassenaer concluded that the Maple has a quantifiable monetary value of $46,200.</P>
<P>18. Mr. van Wassenaer notes that the Maple provides several significant additional benefits to the use, enjoyment, and value of the Respondents' property. Among the specific benefits that Mr. van Wassenaer notes in his report:
<P1>(a) <EM>Shade</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at p. 5, RAR, p. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mature Norway maple trees cast dense shade, which has multiple ancillary benefits. As the only large-stature tree in the rear yard of the property at [location omitted] the Maple's large and full canopy casts shade across the house and backyard for a considerable portion of the day. The Tree's removal would add another four to six hours of light to [location omitted]and eliminate afternoon shade altogether, which would make the backyard far less hospitable during the warmer summer months.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Arborist Report of Adam Vandermeij (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Vandermeij Report</BOLD>&rdquo;), Affidavit of Drew Allen sworn August 30, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Allen Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), Exhibit A, Application Record dated August 31, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>AR</BOLD>&rdquo;), p. 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>Energy Savings</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at pp. 5-6, RAR, pp 54-55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Tree shade reduces solar heating, and evapotranspiration through tree leaves helps cool the local microclimate. Due to its close proximity to the house at [location omitted] and the shade it casts, the Maple reduces energy use demand.</P1>
<P1>(c) <EM>Air Quality</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at p. 6, RAR, p. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Maple likely contributes to improved local air quality and physical wellbeing by dry deposition of particulate pollutants, such as soot from vehicle exhaust, and the chemical processing of pollutants. This direct effect on air quality contributes to the Respondents' and their guests' enjoyment of the rear patio and backyard where they spend considerable time in the summer months.</P1>
<P1>(d) <EM>Property Value and Aesthetics</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at p. 6, RAR, p. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mature and healthy trees can significantly increase the value of residential and commercial properties, largely due to their aesthetic appeal. The neighbourhood around Hudson Drive is characterized by a large and healthy tree canopy, which contributes to its desirability and livability. The Maple contributes to the value of the property at [location omitted] due to its aesthetic appeal.</P1>
<P1>(e) <EM>Habitat</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at p. 6, RAR, p. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Urban trees provide valuable habitat and refugia for a wide range of species, such as insects, birds and small mammals, and one of the most important habitat functions of mature urban trees in Toronto is the provision of resting sites for small migratory birds. The Tree's removal would eliminate its contributions to wildlife habitat and deprive the Respondents of the accompanying experiences.</P1>
<P1>(f) <EM>Stormwater Reduction</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at p. 7, RAR, p. 56</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mature urban trees can protect and improve water quality and help to reduce stormwater runoff, erosion and flooding. The Maple may contribute to a reduced incidence of basement flooding on adjacent properties, and the Tree's removal may increase the frequency and/or severity of such flooding events. The van Wassenaer Report references the parties' neighbour, Ms. Lang, who advises that the Maple's &ldquo;massive root system is beneficial in soaking up rain and melting snow and I fear the removal of this very large and established healthy tree could cause more flooding issues on my property.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Lang Letter, MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit H, RAR, p. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(g) <EM>Decline of Other Trees</EM>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 7, RAR, p. 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Maple is one of three large trees on the property at [location omitted] [location omitted] The other two are beech trees, which are infected by a terminal disease known as Beech bark disease and likely to require removal within five years. The eventual loss of those trees makes the retention of the Maple and the benefits that it provides even more important to [location omitted] and the Respondents.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Applicants Planned their Renovation Without Regard for the Maple and the Respondents' Rights</EM></TI>
<P>19. In and around April 2017, the Applicants advised the Respondents of their proposed renovation of [location omitted]. It became apparent from these conversations that the destruction and removal of the Maple was a part of the Applicants' plans. The Respondents made it clear from the outset that they would not consent to the Maple's removal because it was too important to them and contributed significantly to the enjoyment of their property.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 12, RAR, p. 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Although the Applicants promised to share their construction plans as they developed, the Applicants ignored the Respondents' requests for updates throughout the summer and fall of 2 017. When Mr. Allen finally did share the particulars of the plans at a mid-December 2017 meeting, he delivered them in the form of a finished set of architectural drawings which envisioned the Maple's destruction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at paras. 13-14, RAR, p. 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Ms. MacDougall sent the Applicants an email shortly thereafter, on December 23, 2017. In her message, Ms. MacDougall reiterated the importance of the Maple to her family while emphasizing that she and Mr. Scott had no objection to a construction project that did not involve removal of the tree:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Meghan MacDougall to Susan Allen dated December 23, 2018, Allen Affidavit, Exhibit F, AR, pp. 56-57 (Emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Drew, thanks for coming over and sharing the plans with us. It was great to see how you want to improve your house. When you showed us the plans, you made it clear that it was your intention to have the tree removed. <UNDER>As you know, this is something that we are against as the tree provides some vital shade for our house and garden and is one of the reasons why we enjoy our house so much in the summer. It adds considerable value to the enjoyment of our property and is one of the reasons we chose this neighbourhood.</UNDER> In addition, we have had two arborists confirm that the tree is healthy...</P>
<P>Whilst we do want to be good neighbours, this is something we are not willing to negotiate on and want to state quite clearly that we do not give you permission to cut down the tree. <UNDER>We are not against you developing or renovating your house at all we just hope that you and your architect can find a solution and design that does not require the removal of the tree.</UNDER></P>
<P>Happy to discuss this further if you like.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>22. The Applicants did not respond to Ms. MacDougall's overture or otherwise consult with the Respondents about the proposed renovation. The Respondents' subsequent attempts to discuss the matter with the Applicants also went unanswered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g., Email from Nigel Scott to Drew Allen and Sue Allen, April 10, 20 18, MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit E, RAR, p. 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. In early 2018, the Respondents participated in a mediation involving the Applicants and their architect, Tom Spragge. Although the Respondents approached the mediation in good faith, it was not successful.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at para. 24, RAR, p. 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. As is required for an application for a permit to injure or destroy a tree, the Applicants included a replanting plan. The plan proposed by the Applicants and their architect does not consider the Respondents or compensate for the loss of the Maple. Mr. van Wassenauer states that the so-called replacement trees proposed in the replanting plan will provide little to no benefit to [location omitted] because they are located far from the Respondents' property and will take decades to mature into trees that can provide a canopy comparable to what the Maple presently provides.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 12, RAR, p. 61.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(iv)</EM></N><TI><EM>The &ldquo;Approvals&rdquo; Obtained by the Applicants Are Irrelevant to this Application</EM></TI>
<P>25. In January 2018, a month after Ms. MacDougall's email, the Applicants sought and obtained certain minor variances from the Committee of Adjustment. In June 2018 they obtained building permits from Toronto Urban Forestry and the City of Toronto Building Department. These administrative decisions are necessary to comply with the City of Toronto by-laws, but do not in any way give the Applicants permission to destroy the Maple.</P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>1</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Committee of Adjustment Did not Consider the Maple</EM></TI>
<P>26. The Applicants attended at the Committee of Adjustment to obtain certain minor variances as a prerequisite for the proposed renovation. The variances requested were for increases in the maximum allowable (i) floorspace, (ii) building length, (iii) gross floor area, and (iv) side lot setback.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Decision dated January 30, 2018, Allen Affidavit, Exhibit H, AR, p. 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Committee did not specifically consider issues relating to the Maple. (Nor does the Committee <EM>ever</EM> deal with property disputes as between neighbours.)</P>
<P>27. Prior to retaining counsel, the Respondents did make written representations to the Committee and attended a January 24, 2018 meeting regarding the Applicants' request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Meg Scott to Sylvia Mullaste, Allen Affidavit, Exhibit G, AR, p. 59; MacDougall Affidavit at para. 22, RAR, p. 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At that hearing, the Respondents learned that the Committee of Adjustment was not the proper forum in which to adjudicate the protection of the Maple.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MacDougall Affidavit at paras 22-23, RAR, p. 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Specifically, the panel advised that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the Maple, but only the minor variances requested by the Applicants. As such, the Respondents did not appeal when the Committee ultimately approved the Applicants' request. Mr. Allen acknowledged on cross-examination that the Committee of Adjustment lacks the jurisdiction to determine what is or is not a boundary tree and does not adjudicate property disputes between neighbours.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Transcript, P. 32, QQ. 293-294, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. At paragraph 37 of his affidavit, Mr. Allen comments that the Moore Park Residents Association did not oppose the Applicants' request to the Committee of Adjustment. This evidence is misleading. In a letter dated November 19, 2018, the Director of the Association states that the Association may have intervened had the Applicants disclosed that the proposed renovation contemplated the Maple's destruction. He writes that the Applicants' plan to destroy the Maple is anathema to the Moore Park Residents Association's commitment to preserving the canopy of trees that define the neighbourhood:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gawen Letter, MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit G, RAR, p. 32 (Emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>We again reviewed the plans and concluded that the variances were indeed &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in nature and so we decided not to intervene. <UNDER>At that time we had no idea that there was a tree issue and that construction would involve the destruction of a beautiful mature tree on the Boundary with #89. If we had been aware of this, we most likely would have opposed the application because we want to preserve the canopy of trees for which Moore Park is well known.</UNDER> Such trees provide shade for our houses in the summer and, particularly in this area where groundwater is a problem, suck up large amounts of water to help reduce flooding.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. Another neighbour, Michael Bartouche, states that he did not support the Applicants' request to the Committee of Adjustment specifically because he objected to the removal of the Maple.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bertouche Letter, MacDougall Affidavit, Exhibit I, RAR, p. 37.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He continues, &ldquo;The [Applicants] were made aware that I was not supportive of this renovation as I believe the beauty of Moore Park and the tree canopy is special and valuable to the community and needs to be preserved. At this point, [Mr. Allen] said my support wasn't required anymore anyway.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>..</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>2</EM>.</N><TI><EM>A Permit Is Necessary but not Sufficient To Remove the Maple</EM></TI>
<P>30. The Applicants have obtained certain permits from Toronto Urban Forestry and the City of Toronto Building Department as a prerequisite to the proposed renovation. There is no dispute that the Applicants have obtained a permit to injure a tree. Those permits, however, do not authorize the destruction of the Maple without the Respondents' consent.</P>
<P>31. The Applicants attach significant weight to the permit to destroy a tree. Indeed, Toronto Urban Forestry notified the Applicants of its decision to issue a permit in a March 22, 2018 notification letter (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Notification Letter</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter of Lisa Carson dated March 22, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Notification Letter</BOLD>&rdquo;), Allen Affidavit, Exhibit O, AR, p. 98</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Notification Letter expressly states that it does not limit the rights of adjoining property owners or authorize the destruction of a tree. It explains that it is only a release of the Applicants' obligations under the Toronto city by-laws, but does not release them of their legal obligations to their neighbours:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notification Letter, Allen Affidavit, Exhibit O, AR, p. 98.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>We wish to emphasize that the issuance of a permit to remove the above noted tree does not supersede any civil or common law property rights. The permit is only an acknowledgment that the proposed removal, if carried out in accordance wit the terms and conditions of the permit, will not constitute a violation of the Private Tree By-Law. <UNDER>The permit does not determine ownership and does not authorize you as the applicant to encroach upon or enter another's private property or to remove a tree owned by another without their consent.</UNDER> It is your responsibility as the applicant to resolve any ownership issue or other property disputes.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. Similarly, the June 20, 2018 letters accompanying the Applicants' building permits confirm that the proposed renovation complies with city by-laws and do not even mention the Maple.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Building Permits 18 157345 PLB 00 PS and 18 157345 PLB 00 PS, Allen Affidavit, Exhibit R and S, AR, pp. 108 and 113.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The building permits are entirely irrelevant to the issues on this Application.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>3</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Applicants' Speculation About the Permit Process Is Unfounded</EM></TI>
<P>33. At paragraph 77 of their factum, the Applicants assert that Toronto Urban Forestry undertook certain due diligence prior to issuing the permit. These assertions are entirely speculative, and the Applicants have not provided any evidence as to Toronto Urban Forestry's ordinary practice in processing permit applications or what municipal employees did in this particular case. Despite relying on the Toronto Strategic Forest Management Plan,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum at para. 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Applicants have not included that plan in the record,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>At Tab 2D of the Transcript Brief, the Applicants include a one-page overview of the Toronto Strategic Forest Management Plan as Exhibit 4 for identification on the cross-examination of Mr. van Wassenaer. This summary document contains no detail and is not the plan itself. See van Wassenaer Transcript, P. 17, Q. 85, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> identified what provisions of the Plan they rely upon, or explained how it is taken into account in permit applications.</P>
<P>34. At paragraphs 39-40 of their factum, the Applicants make a number of assertions regarding the impartiality of Mr. van Wassenaer's evidence as to the practices of Toronto Urban Forestry. The Applicants charge that Mr. van Wassenaer violated his Acknowledgement of Expert's Duty<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Acknowledgment of Expert's Duty sworn January 8, 2019, Wassenaer Affidavit, Exhibit A, RAR, p. 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> for refusing to give speculative answers outside his personal knowledge and expertise.</P>
<P>35. More specifically, the Applicants criticize Mr. van Wassenaer for declining to agree that Toronto Urban Forestry took into account, among other things, shade, energy savings, and air quality when assessing the Maple. Mr. van Wassenaer had no factual basis to agree with the inferences put to him by counsel. He was not involved in the permit-issuance process. Moreover, the terms &ldquo;shade&rdquo;, &ldquo;energy savings&rdquo;, and &ldquo;air quality&rdquo; do not appear in either the Toronto Tree Protection Policy (which formed the basis of counsel's questions)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See van Wassenaer Transcript, PP. 34&ndash;44, QQ. 169&ndash;201, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or the Notification Letter. Mr. van Wassenaer's evidence was that in his experience Toronto Urban Forestry deals with a significant volume of applications and does not always follow its own policies.</P>
<P>36. As the excerpt below demonstrates, Mr. van Wassenaer acted fairly, impartially, and answered questions within his personal knowledge and expertise:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Transcript, PP. 30&ndash;32, QQ 157&ndash;160, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Q. All right. And the Urban Forestry would make an assessment of the impact of the tree on air quality?</P>
<P>A. They may but it's, you know, given the number of applications they process and the number of trees that they look at, they might do that, but I think it would be unlikely they are assessing each and every one of these attributes. I think they are...these are attributes that they would generally consider. I find it unlikely that they perform an analysis of each application for each of these attributes.</P>
<P>Q. Sir, I take it from your answer that you are not 100% confident, notwithstanding that you claim expertise in urban forestry, that you are aware of what the process of what the City of Toronto Urban Forestry goes through when assessing a tree destruction permit application.</P>
<P>A. I'm quite aware of the policy and the procedure that is in print and in paper. I'm also, from a practical perspective, have experienced that all of that policy is not always applied. That is my professional experience working in the City of Toronto.</P>
<P>Q. I take it, sir, with respect to the consideration of the Allens' tree destruction permit you don't know whether the policy was or was not followed.</P>
<P>A. I don't, no. I do not know who the planner was in this case. I do not know what material they chose to look at and how extensive a review they did of that material. Unfortunately it is one of the issues that we experience a variability in how these applications are dealt with over time and across individuals.</P>
<P>Q. Fair enough, sir. So then you will agree with me then in the absence of evidence that the individual who reviewed the application didn't follow the policy, then the policy was followed.</P>
<P>A. I'm not sure I can agree with that statement because I simply just don't know.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>37. These answers are perfectly reasonable and reflect an expert who has chosen to stay within the bounds of his knowledge and expertise rather than accept counsel's invitation to speculate about the practice of an agency for whom he does not work. There is no evidence about Toronto Urban Forestry's general or specific practice regarding a permit issuance. Mr. van Wassanaer was not partial. He simply refused to give the answer that the Applicants wanted.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Most of the Proposed Renovation Can Happen while Leaving the Tree Alone</EM></TI>
<P>38. It is possible to significantly improve the Applicants' home with the Maple intact.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Transcript at P. 27, Q 180, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Applicants have raised three children, now teenagers, in their 2400-square-foot Moore Park home.

<P>39. At paragraphs 14 through 34 of his Affidavit, Mr. Allen lists a number of &ldquo;practical issues&rdquo;&mdash;problems with their current home&mdash;that the Applicants wish to remedy with the proposed renovation. He describes these problems that must be addressed to &ldquo;bring the house up to current safety, wellness and comfort standards.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Affidavit para. 19, AR, p. 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These practical issues consist of: (i) an inconsistent heating system and air conditioning, (ii) lack of proper insulation, (iii) periodic flooding, and (iv) the presence of knob and tube wiring.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>. at paras. 14 through 34, AR, pp. 14&ndash;17; Allen Transcript, PP 28&ndash;30, QQ 181&ndash;196, Transcript Brief, Tab 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Respondents Can Expand their Home while Retaining the Maple</EM></TI>
<P>41. The only potential constraint that the Maple imposes on the proposed renovation relates to the manner and extent to which the Applicants can increase the square footage of their home. The proposed renovation contemplates replacing the Applicants' existing addition with a larger one that will expand size of their home by over 50%, from 2400 to 3700 square feet.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Affidavit at para. 31, AR, p. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Applicants' architectural plan calls for moving the basement foundation walls into the yard of [location omitted] and near the boundary of [location omitted], which is where the Maple's roots are located.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 10, RAR, p. 59.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. According to Mr. van Wassenaer, expanding the foundation of [location omitted] in this manner will encroach deep into the Maple's Tree Protection Zone (&ldquo;<BOLD>TPZ</BOLD>&rdquo;) and kill the tree.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Transcript, P. 56, QQ 270&ndash;272, Transcript Brief, Tab 2a.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A TPZ is a fenced area surrounding a tree that protects both its trunk and the root system below ground from construction impacts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 8, RAR, p. 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As set out in the <EM>Toronto Tree Protection Policy and Specifications for Constructions Near Trees</EM> (2016) (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Tree Protection Policy</BOLD>&rdquo;),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Toronto Tree Protection Policy and Specifications for Constructions Near Trees</EM> (2016), Van Wassenaer Report, Appendix 2, RAR, pp. 71-72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> construction and excavation are generally prohibited in a TPZ. Practically speaking, however, it is impossible to completely prohibit construction in the TPZ of all urban trees. For instance, the Applicants' existing addition already encroaches on the Maple's TPZ.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report, Appendix 1, Figure 3, RAR, p. 64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Mr. van Wassenaer's opinion is not that the Applicants are barred entirely from building in the TPZ. Rather, his evidence is that a tree-sensitive design is required, such that the architects and planners must consider reducing excavation or fill in the area between the Tree and the footprint of the existing addition.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Transcript, Q. 55, Q 266, Transcript Brief, Tab 2a.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. The van Wassenaer Report explains that it is the Applicants' insistence on a fully excavated basement that renders the proposed renovation incompatible with the Maple. Relying on his experience in formulating protection measures around trees in order to facilitate construction projects,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., PP 50-51, QQ. 237-238, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> he maintains that there &ldquo;are many different design opportunities that would allow for a significant addition to built [location omitted] while respecting the preservation requirements of [the Maple].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Van Wassenaer Report at p. 11, RAR, p. 60.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to Mr. van Wassenaer, what is essential is that the below ground portion of the current design be reduced and proper tree preservation protocols implemented during construction:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., at pp. 10-11, RAR, pp. 59-60.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>...[The] current site design for the renovations at [location omitted] precludes the provision of the required TPZ for [the Maple] because of the size and location of the rear addition. The exterior wall of the proposed addition would be within 1m of the base of [the Maple] and the over-dig excavation required to build the wall and its foundations would encroach even further into the minimum TPZ of [the Maple], Building the proposed one-story addition will effectively remove a large portion of the root system including the structural roots of the tree.</P>
<P>The current design requires the removal of [the Maple]. However, if the preservation requirements for [the Maple] were properly taken into account in the design process, there may still be opportunities for the development of an addition to the existing house. However, I could only evaluate the specific impacts to [the Maple] if an alternate design and the accompanying tree preservation plans were available. I am not aware of any such alternative designs.</P>
<P>At a minimum however, a successful alternative design would require a reduction in the extent of the below-ground renovation, thereby reducing the loss of roots within the TPZ of [the Maple]. The proposed one-storey addition currently provides a full basement. If the below-ground portion of the current design were reduced and proper tree preservation protocols were implemented during the construction of the addition, there should be ways to preserve [the Maple] (subject to the specific details of the alternate design). A viable alternative should allow for a substantial portion of the proposed addition to be constructed.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>45. Without commenting on what precise design opportunities are available, Mr. van Wassenaer concludes that it is at least possible to both retain the Maple and improve upon the Applicants' existing addition. An arborist such as Mr. van Wassenaer could have assisted the Applicants' architects in designing such tree-sensitive plans.</P>
<P>46. It is not unreasonable to limit the scope of the Applicants' renovation to something slightly under 50% of its present size. The Applicants can still build a substantial addition. They can build on the existing footprint; they can build an addition that is slightly smaller than the present design and which employs a proper Tree Protection Plan; or they can build a large addition that expands only to the south, away from [location omitted]and the Maple. There may be also more sophisticated solutions that require technical expertise. For instance, Mr. van Wassenaer testified on cross-examination that there are different kinds of foundations that do not require excavation, such as a foundation on piers with a grade beam.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Wassenear Transcript, PP. 55-56, QQ. 268-269, Transcript Brief, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

A substantial inference with property is one that is non-trivial. Reasonableness is not considered unless and until the threshold of substantial interference is met. It is concerned with whether the non-trivial interference is unreasonable in all the circumstances.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Maple Does not Interfere with the Applicants' Land</EM></TI>
<P>56. The continued existence of the Maple does not substantially interfere with the Applicants or their property. The Tree does not prevent the Applicants from renovating their bedrooms and bathrooms, replacing their insulation, wiring, heating and cooling systems, or addressing any purported flooding. It does not prevent them from improving their basement or expanding the square footage of their home. To the extent that the Maple affects the Applicants, it requires them to deviate somewhat from their current architectural plans by reducing the size or altering the dimensions of their walkout basement.</P>
<P>57. The law of nuisance is defined by the standard of an ordinary, reasonable person. The purported nuisance must amount to more than a slight annoyance or trifling interference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Antrim</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 22, RBOA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It must be an inconvenience that materially interferes with ordinary comfort &ldquo;as defined according to standards held by those of plain and sober tastes.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>..</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Claims based &ldquo;on the prompting of excessive &lsquo;delicacy and fastidiousness&rsquo;&rdquo; are not actionable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>59. This case is unlike <CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC></CASEREF>, on which the Applicants rely. In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendant after he engaged in self-help by removing certain boundary trees. The court found the trees to have been a nuisance in the circumstances because they prevented the defendants from building a fence for the express purpose of ensuring the safety of their six -year old child with special needs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Davis v. Sutton</SOC><CITE>2017 CarswellOnt 5533</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. Div.

<P>60. This Application does not involve danger, the safety and security of a child, or any such serious concern. The Applicants simply want to increase the size of their already large home by 50%. They assert that their &ldquo;needs&rdquo; cannot be reasonably accommodated with the Maple in place. But when pressed on cross-examination, it became clear that the Applicants' &ldquo;needs&rdquo; amounted to no more than the desires of the well-to-do: more storage space, more entertainment space and more bedrooms.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>On cross-examination Mr. Allen swore that his family's home had three bedrooms. This evidence must be evaluated in the context of a Municipal Property Assessment Corporation printout produced by counsel for the Applicants' one week later, on Ms. MacDougall's cross-examination.

Mr. Allen's own words make clear that it is a sense of entitlement, not nuisance, that has created this impasse:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Transcript, PP. 33&ndash;36, QQ 217, 223&ndash;226; 237&ndash;241; 245, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>Q. What are those needs?</P>

<P>A. I may have exaggerated a bit there.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. Further and in any event, the Applicants have not introduced evidence capable of supporting their argument that their desire to expand their home requires the destruction of the Maple. The Applicants bear the burden to prove not only interference with their property but that the interference is substantial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Antrim</EM>, at para. 28, RBOA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They have not discharged their onus to prove, as they submit, that there is no alternative to the designs prepared by their architect.</P>
<P>62. The van Wassenaer Report, which is uncontradicted, concludes that the Applicants can reconfigure their designs to obtain the desired expansion while still preserving the Maple. The Applicants have tendered no evidence to rebut Mr. van Wassenaer's expert opinion. Indeed, their case relies on a vague and self-serving statement from Mr. Allen that &ldquo;we tried to come up with building plans that would meet our needs while preserving the Tree, if at all reasonably possible.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Affidavit at para. 30, AR, p. 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no evidence from Mr. Spragge himself to support the submission he &ldquo;was not able to come up with a possible and reasonable plan which would allow the Applicants to preserve the tree.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicants' Factum at para. 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, on cross-examination, Mr. Allen conceded that the Applicants never even asked their architect to <EM>try</EM> to come up with designs that accommodated the Tree, nor did the Applicants ask their architect to re-examine the question after reviewing Mr. van Wassanaer's Report, which unequivocally states that building an addition while preserving the Tree is possible.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Transcript, PP. 38-39, QQ 217, 223&ndash;226; 237&ndash;241; 245, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. Bizarrely, at paragraphs 41 through 46 and 67 of their factum, the Applicants criticize the Respondents and Mr. van Wassenaer for not proposing detailed alternative plans to the proposed renovation. The Applicants thus attempt to invert the evidentiary burden: the onus is on them to show that there is no reasonable alternative to the proposed renovation. It is not for the Respondents to commission architects, engineers, and arborists to devise plans for the Applicants' home renovation.</P>
<P>64. The truth is that that the Applicants do have alternatives available to them, but they are inflexible. The Applicants have known since April 2017 of the importance of the Maple to the Respondents. They do not care. Throughout, the Applicants have refused to engage or meaningfully explore a compromise that takes into account their shared property. As became apparent during Mr. Allen's cross-examination, the Applicants are uninterested in anything but the design of their choice and are indifferent to the property rights and concerns of their neighbours:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>., P. 32, 38-39, Q 216; QQ 267&ndash;273, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Q. So you never instructed your architect to put together a set of architectural drawings that would preserve the tree?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Q. The truth is you are not interested in trying to accommodate your neighbours' property rights, correct?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. You don't think a pesky tree should be permitted to get in the way of your renovation.</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. You didn't want to have to build a lopsided renovation. Right? That's what is at the root of this, correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. I'm right in saying that?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. It is not that the tree couldn't be accommodated, it is that you didn't want to accommodate it, correct?</P>
<P>A. It was not reasonably possible.</P>
<P>Q. Well, you could have built an addition, but it wouldn't have been this addition, correct?</P>
<P>A. Correct.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>65. It appears that the Applicants inflexibility is profit-driven. Mr. Allen revealed on cross-examination that the Applicants are exploring the possibility of selling their house and that the purpose of the proposed renovation is to increase the sale price:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Allen Transcript, P. 37 QQ. 256&ndash;259, Transcript Brief, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>67. This Court should not engage in a reasonableness analysis unless it finds the Maple to be a substantial interference with [location omitted]. Regardless, any interference caused by Maple is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
<P>68. The reasonableness of an interference is assessed on the objective standard of a reasonable person set in the context of the general uses found in the area. In <CASEREF><SOC>Pugliese v. Canada (National Capital Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal explained:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>..</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>In determining whether a nuisance exists, it is not sufficient to ask whether an occupier has made a reasonable use of his own property. One must ask whether his conduct is reasonable considering the fact that he has a neighbour. As Lord Wright pointed out in <CASEREF><SOC>Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan</SOC><CITE>[19401 A.C. 880</CITE><PAGENUM>at 903</PAGENUM><CORRELAT><CITE>[1940] 3 All E.R. 349</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>A balance has to be maintained between the right of the occupier to do what he likes with his own, and the right of his neighbour not to be interfered with. It is impossible to give any precise or universal formula, but it may broadly be said that a useful test is perhaps what is reasonable according to the ordinary usages of mankind living in society, or more correctly in a particular society.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>69. In <EM>Yates</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> this Court identified five factors to consider in determining whether there has been an unreasonable interference with a use and enjoyment of land: (i) the type of severity of harm, (ii) the character of the locale, (iii) whether the complainants or their property are abnormally sensitive, and (iv) the utility of the impugned conduct.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Yates</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras. 32-33, RBOA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. All of the foregoing factors favour the Respondents:
<P1>(a) <EM>Severity of Harm</EM>: The potential harm to the Applicants is modest. At most, the Maple poses a limit to the size of their addition and in particular their ability to have a fully excavated basement. Even these restrictions could be mitigated with an alternative, tree-sensitive design.</P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>Character of the Locale</EM>: As underscored by the letters from Mr. Gawen, Ms. Lang, and Mr. Bartouche, the Moore Park neighbourhood is renowned for its trees and was a primary reason that the Respondents chose to live in the neighbourhood. Moore Park's canopy undoubtedly contributes value to the neighbourhood's properties, including[location omitted]</P1>
<P1>(c) <EM>Abnormal Sensitivity</EM>: The Applicants have an idiosyncratic, entitled conception of what &ldquo;they require to meet the needs of their family&rdquo; that is unlikely to be shared by an ordinary person of plain and sober tastes.</P1>
<P1>(d) <EM>Utility</EM>: The aesthetic and material benefits of the Maple, including those relating to animal habitat, air quality, and stormwater reduction, accrue not only to the Applicants but also their neighbours. The Tree Protection Policy underscores the importance of the urban trees more generally: &ldquo;Maintenance, growth, and enhancement of the urban forest are important goals of the City of Toronto.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Toronto Tree Protection Policy, p. 3, van Wassenaer Report, Appendix 2, RAR, p. 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>71. A court must have particular regard to the character of the neighbourhood in determining the reasonableness of an interference with the use and enjoyment of land.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gallant v. Dugard</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 7319</CITE><PARANUM>16-17</PARANUM></CASEREF>, RBOA, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> What may be reasonable in one area may be unreasonable in another. For example, there will be greater tolerance in a rural area for agricultural sights, sounds, and odours. Correspondingly, an urban area will have its own characteristics and features that must be taken into account.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Anderson v. Jefferies</SOC><CITE>BCSC 1410</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, RBOA, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. The character of the neighbourhood was determinative in this court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Gallant v. Dugard</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Yates</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, RBOA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As here, the applicant in that case sought to have a boundary tree declared a nuisance so that he might remove it without the consent of his neighbour. He argued that the tree, a mature black walnut, caused a substantial interference by waking up him and his partner when nuts fell on the roof of his house. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy either branch of the test for nuisance. Justice Gray's comments on the relationship between the character of a particular locale and reasonableness of an interference are equally apposite in this case:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gallant</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 25-26, RBOA, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>The applicant chose to purchase a house in a district of Oakville that is heavily populated by trees. The Town of Oakville and its residents take great pride in the Town's trees, and take steps to preserve them. The community as whole wishes to preserve the trees in this historic district.</P>
<P>It is not unreasonable, in my view, for the applicant to tolerate a degree of interference with this use and enjoyment of his property that is reflected in the evidence, having regard to the particular neighbourhood in which he resides, and having regard to the position of the Town and its residents with respect to the Town's trees in this historic district.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. The requirement that reasonableness be assessed having regard the identity of the parties and their neighbourhood is further basis to distinguish the <EM>Centrum</EM> decision, relied upon by the Applicants. The occupiers in that case were two commercial entities, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and Chez Moi Tavern Limited, and the properties were located in a commercial district on Bloor Street, in downtown Toronto.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Centrum</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 1, ABOA, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Applicants' submission that <EM>Centrum</EM> is &ldquo;completely analogous&rdquo; ignores the fundamental difference in the nature of the parties and their respective interests, tolerances, and expectations in that case (in addition to the legislative distinction discussed above).</P>
<P>74. The Respondents are a passive actor in this case. They are not seeking to interfere or otherwise encroach upon[location omitted]&mdash;only to preserve one of the most beloved features of their home. A desire to maintain a status quo that is consonant with the character of a neighbourhood is not unreasonable. What is unreasonable is the Applicants' insistence that their desire to increase the value of their house for sale justifies the destruction of the Respondents' property.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPLICANTS (Application returnable March 26, 2019)</TI>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>I</N><TI>OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This is an application seeking an Order permitting the removal of a boundary tree located between the properties municipally known as [location omitted] [location omitted]and[location omitted]</P>
<P>2. The boundary tree is a nuisance. The Applicants, like many other home owners in the Moore Park area, wish to modernize their home and add an addition. The Applicants' design requires the removal of the tree. The City of Toronto has approved the Applicants' design and has issued the required building permits. The Committee of Adjustment for the City of Toronto approved the minor variances required for the Applicants' design to be implemented. Most importantly, the City of Toronto, Urban Forestry has issued a Tree Destruction Permit because in order to implement the Applicants' design Urban Forestry found &ldquo;that no reasonable alternatives to tree removal are possible and the tree qualifies for removal under the By-Law.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICANTS' RESPONDING SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS</TI>
<P>1. The Respondents were successful in resisting the Application brought by the Applicants and as such, are seeking a total of $77,091.35, inclusive of fees, disbursements, and HST, representing costs on a partial indemnity scale prior to February 14, 2019, due to the service of a <EM>Rule</EM> 49 Offer to Settle of the same date, and on a substantial indemnity scale thereafter. The Respondents alternatively seek to recover partial indemnity costs of $67,670.58. The Applicants' position is that a reasonable quantum of costs in these circumstances is $25,981.12, inclusive of fees, disbursements, and HST.</P>
<P>2. Pursuant to section 131 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, this Honourable Court has discretion with respect to costs awarded and may consider the factors listed under <EM>Rule</EM> 57.01 in exercising this discretion. In reviewing these factors, the Applicants submit that the costs sought by the Respondents in this matter are exorbitant in the circumstances.</P>
<P>3. One of the factors that the Court may consider is the amount of costs that an unsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay in relation to the proceeding for which costs are being awarded. In doing so, the Court may compare the unsuccessful party's fees to those of the successful party<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway v. Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Co. of Canada</SOC><CITE>2005 CarswellOnt 4402</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Ground J.) at paras 10-11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. The Applicants attach their Bill of Costs, which list total fees on a partial indemnity scale of $17,982.00, exclusive of HST, that the Applicants would have handed up at the hearing. On a partial indemnity basis, the Applicants would have sought $22,505.24, inclusive of fees, disbursements, and HST. By comparison, the Respondents have claimed a total of $50,002.80 in partial indemnity fees, exclusive of HST. As such, there is a significant disparity between the costs incurred by each party and the costs sought by the Respondents are well beyond the reasonable expectations of the Applicants or any litigant in such a case.</P>
<P>4. This disparity is, in part, due to the increased rates charged by the Respondents' counsel. Senior counsel for the Respondents, Nader Hasan (&ldquo;Hasan&rdquo;), has been called to the bar for 12 years and charges an actual rate of $525.00/hour, whereas senior counsel for the Applicants, Christopher Cosgriffe (&ldquo;Cosgriffe&rdquo;) has 25 years of experience and is a Certified Specialist (Civil Litigation), and charges an actual rate of $500.00/hr.</P>
<P>5. The disparity in amounts claimed is also due to the number of hours expended by Respondents' counsel. For the sake of comparison, the Applicants also attach copies of their counsel's time entries, demonstrating a total of 86.6 hours incurred by Applicants' counsel with respect to the Application. Comparatively, the Respondents' counsel have docketed a total of 182.5 hours or about 100 hours more for the same application.</P>
<P>6. The Applicants submit that the fees to be awarded to the Respondents should be limited to those set out in the Applicants' Revised Bill of Costs, amounting to total fees of $21,058.00, exclusive of HST, which was if the Applicants were claiming on a substantial indemnity basis from February 14, 2019, resulting in a total of $25,981.12 inclusive of fees, disbursements, and HST.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Cross-Examinations</EM></TI>
<P>7. Three cross-examinations were conducted with respect to this Application. All took less than two hours and generated only 175 pages of transcripts. The Respondents have identified time spent with respect to preparation for and attendance at cross-examinations for both Hasan and Benjamin Kates (&ldquo;Kates&rdquo;). Kates and Cosgriffe attended all three cross-examinations and claimed 13.1 and 13.6 respectively on the bills of costs. Hasan attended only one of the cross-examinations and the Respondents have claimed a total of 15.3 hours for Hasan's time. It is unreasonable that the Respondents are claiming more hours for Hasan, who attended only one of the cross-examinations, than the hours worked for Kates and Cosgriffe.</P>
<P>8. Further, the hours claimed by both Hasan and Kates with respect to cross-examinations are duplicative. Due to the limited complexity of this matter, which related to the issue of nuisance caused by a boundary tree, it was not necessary for two counsel to participate in the cross-examinations in this matter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Post-February 14, 2019</EM></TI>
<P>9. The Respondents have claimed a total of 86.3 hours for their counsel post-February 14, 2019 in the section of their Bill of Costs entitled &ldquo;Pleadings, Communications, Civil Practice Court&rdquo;. This time was incurred after the Respondents' Application Record was delivered on January 9, 2019. Time for cross-examinations is allocated under a separate &ldquo;Cross-Examination&rdquo; heading. It can be reasonably inferred that these 86.3 hours must then relate only to the preparation of the Respondents' Factum and Book of Authorities, and preparation for the hearing. Comparatively, counsel for the Applicants incurred only 37.1 hours for these same items, resulting in a significant difference of 49.2 hours.</P>
<P>10. In addition, the Respondents' claim for 86.3 hours post-February 14, 2019 is not only highly disproportionate to the hours for the Applicants' counsel, but is also disproportionate with respect to the average complexity of this matter. This Application saw three affidavits sworn, three cross-examinations that were each less than two hours, and twelve distinct cases put before the Court. Argument of the Application was for slightly more than half a day. The amount claimed by the Respondents is disproportionate to what needed to be done to have the Application heard.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Summary</EM></TI>
<P>11. In light of the significant disparities between the hours incurred and rates charged by Respondents' and Applicants' counsel, the fees claimed by the Respondents are not appropriate. As a result, the Applicants submit that the fees awarded to the Respondents should be limited to $21,058.00, exclusive of HST, resulting in an award of no more than $25,981.12, inclusive of fees, disbursements, and HST.</P>
