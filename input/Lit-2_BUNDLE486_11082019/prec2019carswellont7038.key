<P><P1>This case arises from the ownership dispute based on a verbal agreement between the Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Warraich&rdquo;) and Defendants, Aftab Ahmed Choudhry (&ldquo;Choudhry&rdquo;), concerning a ho use with the municipal address of 29 Machockie Road, Toronto, Ontario, (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>The Defendants purchased the said Property in March 2012. Following the Purchase, Choudhry offered Warraich 50% of ownership in the property in exchange for 50% of the acquisition costs and 50% of the carrying costs of the Property. Parties agreed on the terms and acted on that Agreement from March 2012 to April 2016.</P1>
<P1>In or around April 2016, the Plaintiff approached the Choudhry for separation of their respective ownership interests. Although parties negotiated, they could not reach an Agreement. Following discussions and negotiations through an intermediary, parties reached an Agreement on separating their respective ownership interests on September 02, 2013. Pursuant to that Agreement, the Defendants agreed to grant a mortgage to the Plaintiff equal to the Plaintiff's share in the Property.</P1>
<P1>However, after the 2nd written agreement to grant a mortgage to the Plaintiff, the Defendants once again reneged on their promise and took the position that they wanted to refinance the property before granting a mortgage to the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>As there would have been no equity left in the Property after the refinancing by the Defendants, the Plaintiff commenced the within proceedings to protect the equity in the Property, protect its investment and enforce its rights.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE AGREEMENT:</TI>
<P><P1>4. The Plaintiff, Warraich claims that on or around March of 2012, the Defendants, Choudhry, offered the Plaintiff 50% ownership share in the subject property, being 29 Machockie Road, Toronto, Ontario. The Plaintiff and the Defendants entered into a verbal contract around March, 2012 whereby the Plaintiff, in exchange for 50% ownership in the property the Plaintiff paid to the Defendantss 50% of the acquisition and 50% of the carrying costs of the Property. Parties agree that Warraich will live in the Property until the seperation of their respective interests.</P1>
<P1>5. In accordance with the Agreement, Warraich made the following contribution;
<P2>a) Warraich contributed approximately $62,000.00 as one half of the acquisition costs of the Property by April, 2012.</P2>
<P2>b) Warraich faithfully contributed $ 2200.00 per month towards the carrying costs of the Property from March 2012 until 2014 as well as 50% of the additional costs of the property.</P2>

<BLOCK2><TI>SEPERATION OF THE RESPECTIVE INTERESTS OF PARTIES</TI>
<P><P1>7. The Plaintiff claims that in April, 2016, the Plaintiff approached the Defendantss and asked the Defendantss about seperating their respective ownership interests in the subject property.</P1>
<P1>8. Warraich suggested to Choudhry based on the appraised current market value of the Property, either partner should buyout the ownership interest of the other partner to seperate their interest.</P1>
<P1>9. Warraich also offered that the Property be sold to a third party through Multiple Listing Service and the two partners should receive the net sale proceeds based on their 50% ownership share.</P1>
<P1>10. During negotiations, Warraich offered more money to the Defendants than the Defendants was prepared to pay the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>11. During these negotiations, Choudhry took unreasonable positions. He did not accept the offer of Warraich, and at the same time, he was not ready to make a reasonable offer. In sum, Choudhry refused to agree to any of the reasonable suggestions of Warraich. As a result, parties could not reach an Agreement.</P1>
<P1>12. After failing to resolve the dispute following several sessions of negotiations and discussion, parties negotiated through an intermediary. Parties finally reached an Agreement on September 02, 2016.</P1></P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM</TI>
<P><P1>1. The defendants, Aftab Ahmed Choudhry and Nuzhat Yasmin admit paragraphs 1,2, 3 and 34 of the Statement of Claim.</P1>
<P1>2. The defendants deny each other paragraph of the Statement of Claim.</P1>
<P1>3. The defendants deny the allegations in the Overview that there was any verbal agreement or other agreement with respect to the ownership of the subject property between the parties.</P1>
<P1>4. The defendants purchased the property in March 2012. The basis for the purchase was to eventually renovate and resell the property. The defendants contributed their own funds for the down payment, arranged mortgage financing for the balance of the price and closed the transaction on their own without any assistance from the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>5. There was no exchange of ownership rights nor was there any verbal agreement made as alleged in paragraphs 4 and 5.</P1>
<P1>6. The plaintiff and defendants knew each other for a long time and had become friends. The plaintiff at that time, needed a place to live since he was going to be buying and renovating another property and it was not going to be ready for some time.</P1>
<P1>7. It was agreed that the plaintiff and his family would move in to the subject property and pay rent.</P1>
<P1>8. Since the defendants had no immediate plans of demolish and /building they agreed to lease the property and entered a landlord and tenant relationship.</P1>
<P1>9. The parties entered a residential tenancy agreement on March 1, 2013 whereby the defendants were landlord and the plaintiff, the tenant. The terms of the lease were that of a month-to-month tenancy beginning on March 1st 2013. Rent was charged at $2,000 per month and utilities were to be paid by the tenant.</P1>
<P1>10. The plaintiff paid the lease payments in accordance with the lease for the following three years 2013, 2014, 2015 and up to June, 2016.</P1>
<P1>11. The defendants retained an architect for the purposes of drawing the plans and specifications for the proposed renovation, Leo from Lemcad Consutlants.</P1>
<P1>12. The plaintiff had general contracting experience and experience in renovating properties and this was known to the defendants.</P1>
<P1>13. The parties knew each other for many years and the defendants trusted his ability and agreed to use him as a general contractor. The parties met with Leo on September 2, 2016 and put on paper the basics of an agreement that set out their respective duties and obligations. It was agreed that a more full and complete agreement would be drafted and entered between the parties.</P1>
<P1>14. Nevertheless, a hand-written agreement was made on September 2, 2016 which set out the rights and obligations of each of the parties. The agreement confirms that the plaintiff and the defendants were not in any joint ownership relationship with respect to this property.</P1>
<P1>15. The hand-written agreement set out that the plaintiff would act as a general contractor and would build a new structure in accordance with the plans and specifications as designed by Lemcad Consultants up to the stage of the building being &ldquo;dry wall ready&rdquo; for the amount of $204,500.</P1>
<P1>16. The plaintiff wanted an advance of $20,000 towards the construction. This was agreeable but since the plaintiff was in arrear in his rent in the amount of $7,200, that amount was to be deducted from the advance of $20,000 for a balance of $12,800. A cheque was issued to plaintiff for that amount.</P1>
<P1>17. The plaintiff agreed that he and his family would move out by October 4,2016 and this was set out in the agreement.</P1>
<P1>18. It was also agreed that the plaintiff would be entitled to interest at the rate of 3.5% on the construction costs until he received payment and that he preserved his right to lien the property in the event of non-payment.</P1>
<P1>19. The defendants were satisfied with the terms of that agreement. It set out that the plaintiff was to be retained as a general contractor and set out the amount for the contracting price. It confirmed the amount of arrears of rent. At no time did the document purport or actually indicate any ownership interest of the plaintiff in the subject property.</P1>
<P1>20. The defendant then received from the plaintiff a document entitled &ldquo;Charge/Mortgage &rdquo; in the amount of $184,500. The plaintiff demanded that the defendants sign the document permitting the registration of a mortgage against their property.</P1>
<P1>21. The defendants refused to sign the document since it was not agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to a mortgage on their property. The defendants refused to sign the mortgage and in response the plaintiff told the plaintiff that they &ldquo;better sign the document or regret it&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>22. The defendants state that the plaintiff then registered a caution on title dated October 3, 2016 purportedly seeking an interest in the property. The plaintiff and his family refused to move out on October 4, 2016.</P1>
<P1>23. The defendants state that the plaintiff breached the agreement made on September 2, 2016. The plaintiff was to have moved out on October 4, 2016 but failed to do so. The plaintiff failed to honour the terms of his commitment to build the project as promised. The plaintiff breached his agreement by demanding that the defendants sign a mortgage on their property.</P1>
<P1>24. The plaintiff has continued to breach his lease agreement and continues not to pay rent. The plaintiff is in breach of his contract to pay rent.</P1>
<P1>25. The fact that the plaintiff has failed to move out and has failed to honour his commitment to build, the defendants have suffered losses and damages.</P1>
<P1>26. The plaintiff is unable to proceed with his project. He is not collecting any rent and he is forced to pay the expenses related to the property. The defendants have a mortgage with the Bank of Nova Scotia and must pay the mortgage failing which it would lose the property by way of a notice of sale under the mortgage.</P1>

<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY AND DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM OF SARFRAZ WARRAICH</TI>
<P><P1>1. The defendant by Counterclaim, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) denies each and every paragraph of the Defence and Counterclaim including the allegations of fact as pleaded in the Defence.</P1>
<P1>2. Sarfraz denies that the entitlement of the Plaintiff by Counterclaim to any of the relief as pleaded in paragraph 30 of the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>3. Sarfraz relies on the allegations as pleaded in the overview and reiterates the allegations of fact as pleaded in the Statement of Claim.</P1>
<P1>4. Sarfraz states that following the verbal agreement, between him and Aftab, he, along with his family moved into the Property as a beneficial owner and has lived there since April 2012. Sarfraz states the he contributed one half of the expenses for the Property from that time onwards.</P1>
<P1>5. Sarfraz states that in 2014, Aftab and his brother Ashfaq, (who acted as the accountant of Sarfraz at the time), made misrepresentations in bad faith, that they required a Residential Tenancy Agreement for tax purposes and based on that misrepresentation, they induced Sarfraz to sign the Residential Tenancy Agreement. Notwithstanding that fraudulent residential lease agreement, Sarfraz always had 50 % of beneficial interest in the Property.</P1>
<P1>6. Sarfraz states that Aftab and his wife held 50 % of the beneficial ownership of the Property in trust for him based on the Verbal Agreement and the conduct of the parties.</P1>
<P1>7. Sarfraz states that it was only in 2016, that Aftab in self-interest refused to admit the ownership of Sarfraz and that too when they could not resolve the valuation and the respective shares of both the partners, i.e. Sarfraz and Aftab. Sarfraz states that on September 2, 2016, despite admitting in writing on September 2, 2016, in front of arm's length third party, the beneficial ownership of one half of the Property, Aftab reneged once again and refused and breached the written agreement concerning the ownership of the Property.</P1>
<P1>8. Sarfraz says that because he had 50% ownership in the Property, that is why he contributed $20,000.00 for obtaining the renovation permits, for the Property. Sarfraz states that no &ldquo;Tenant&rdquo; would contribute or pay $20,000,00 to an architect or obtaining permits for demolition for the &ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;. Sarfraz states that the explanation provided by Aftab for the payment of $20,000.00 is fanciful and contrary to facts.</P1>
<P1>9. Sarfraz states that there never was a Landlord and Tenant relationship and that Aftab and his brother Ashfaq made misrepresentations and induced Sarfraz to sing the Residential Tenancy Agreement.</P1>
<P1>10. Sarfraz states that at the end of each year, Aftab informed him about the total expenses of the Property and he paid 50% of those expense in good faith every year as he was a the beneficial owner of the Property.</P1>
<P1>11. Sarfraz states that the Architect for obtaining the permits was hired by him, as that Architect had worked for the other renovation projects of Sarfraz and his associates.</P1>
<P1>12. Sarfraz denies the allegations as pleaded in paragraph 14, 15, and 16 of the Defence and states that this is an attempt to provide a fanciful explanation instead the one that is based on facts, contemporaneous third party evidence and logic.</P1>
<P1>13. Contrary to the allegation as pleaded in paragraph 18 of the Defence, Sarfraz states that he, i.e. Sarfraz had contributed one half of interest payments that were paid by the Aftab for the bridge financing he had obtained when he purchased the property. Since, Sarfraz paid his share of the acquisition costs of the Property to Aftab after some time, Aftab also wanted to repay the share of Sarfraz after one year. To even things out, Sarfraz agreed that Aftab will pay, the share of Sarfraz after one year, and that the interest rate for the mortgage amount will be the same as the one paid by Aftab on his bridge financing.</P1>
<P1>14. Sarfraz denies the allegation as pleaded in the paragraph 20, and 21 of the Defence and states that this was a logical continuation of events, and that the Mortgage documents were sent to the lawyer of Aftab following the Agreement of September 2, 2016. The explanation provided by Aftab for the payment of $184,000.00 defies all logic and is an attempt to distort facts.</P1>
<P1>15. Sarfraz denies the allegations of fact as pleaded in paragraph. 23, 24 and 25. Sarfraz states that despite agreeing in writing to provide a mortgage equal to the beneficial interest of the Sarfraz, Aftab refused to sign the mortgage documents, and breeched the Agreement of September 2, 2016.</P1>
<P1>16. Sarfraz denies allegations as pleaded in the Defence and states that these allegations are not only false but they also do not make any sense, as they have been pleaded to misrepresent facts and therefor they defy all logic.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM</TI>
<P><P1>17. The plaintiff repeats, adopts and relies upon the allegations of fact as pleaded in the Statement of Claim and in the reply and Defence to the counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>18. The Plaintiff denies that the Plaintiff by Counterclaim is entitled any of the relief as pleaded in paragraph 30 or elsewhere in the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim</P1>
<P1>19. The Plaintiff requests that his claim may be granted and the Defence and Counterclaim of the Defendants be dismissed with costs.</P1></P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Warraich and Choudhry had been friends since about 2000 and had business relations of several years based on verbal agreements and trust.</P>
<P>2. This litigation has resulted from an attempt by the Defendant Aftab Choudhry (&ldquo;Choudhry&rdquo;) to deny the 50% ownership share of the Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Warraich&rdquo;) in [location omitted] (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>3. In March 2012, the Defendant, Defendant Aftab Choudhry (&ldquo;Choudhry&rdquo;) purchase [location omitted] (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;). He offered 50% ownership interest to the Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Warraich&rdquo;) based on terms and conditions that were accepted by the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>4. The Plaintiff claims that he fulfilled the terms of the verbal contract. In September 2016, parties entered into a written contract to separate their respective shares in the Property. This written contract was based on the verbal contract of 2012. The Defendant has breached the terms of the written contract of September 02, 2016 and he denies that he had any verbal contract with Warraich in March 2012.</P>
<P>5. The Plaintiff seeks a declaration from the Honourable Court that he has 50% ownership share in the Property and seeks one half of the net sale proceeds of the Property following the partition and sale of the Property. In the alternative, Warraich is entitled to a resulting trust for his share in the Property. In the further alternative, Warraich claims that Choudhry has been unjustly enriched and must disgorge the benefits that he has obtained without any juristic reason.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>THE VERBAL CONTRACT OF MARCH 2012</TI>
<P>6. In March 2012, following the purchase of the Property by the Defendant Choudhry, he and the Plaintiff, Warraich entered into a verbal contract whereby Warraich acquired one half of ownership in the said Property in exchange for 50% of acquisition costs, and 50% of carrying costs. Warraich also promised that he would bear the cost of permits for the redevelopment of the Property.</P>
<P>7. Warraich paid 50% of the acquisition costs ($62,000.00 over a period of one year) and paid 50% of carrying cost of the Property from April 2012 to 2016. Warraich also paid $20,025.88 to Consultant LEMCAD for permits, etc., for the redevelopment of the Property. Warraich, therefore, fulfilled his obligation pursuant to the Verbal Agreement. The Property has appreciated in price from 2012 to 20 16 and Choudhry is the beneficiary of that appreciation in the price of the Property.</P>
<P>8. According to the Verbal Agreement of March 2012, Parties initially intended to sell the property for profit following redevelopment and share the profit and loss equally.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>THE WRITTEN CONTRACT OF SEPTEMBER 2016</TI>
<P>9. However, in 2016, after obtaining permits for redevelopment, Choudhry wanted to buy-out the ownership interest of Warraich in the Property. To separate their respective 50% ownership share in the Property, Warraich and Choudhry negotiated and with the help of a mutual friend, Waheed Akhtar, reached an agreement.</P>
<P>10. That Agreement was reduced to writing on September 02, 2016, by Leo Mastandrea, on the instructions of both parties. Both parties executed the Agreement. The Written contract was for the Machockie Road Property. The parties were identified and the ownership share being sold was clearly noted as being $184,500.00</P>
<P>11. According to the written contract, Choudhry was to grant a mortgage of $184,500 to Warraich before October 4, 2016 for a term of 1 year baring an interest rate of 3.5% in lieu of the ownership share of Warraich in the Property. Following die registration of the Mortgage, Warraich was to move out of the Property by October 4, 2016.</P>
<P>12. Pursuant to the written agreement of September 02, 2016, Warraich's lawyers sent mortgage documents to the lawyer of Choudhry. Choudhry, however, did not sign the mortgage documents. Warraich testified that Choudhry first wanted to refinance the Property before granting a mortgage to Warraich. The impasse could not be resolved and litigation ensued.</P>
<P>13. On November 1, 2016, Warraich commenced litigation in the Superior Court of Justice through a statement of claim asserting his equitable rights to one-half of ownership of the Property. Choudhry defended the Claim in the Superior Court and also brought a motion for relief before the Superior Court;</P>
<P>14. The Defendant commenced two parallel applications in the Landlord and Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;), claiming that Warraich was merely a tenant.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">MATERIAL FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>EVIDENCE OF WITNESSES</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF SARFRAZ WARRAICH</TI>
<P>15. Warraich testified that he is in die business of renovation of residential properties.</P>
<P>16. Warraich and Choudhry had been friends since about the year 2000. Both belong to the same town of Gujrat in Pakistan and share language and culture. Following meeting each other in Toronto, in or around the year 2000, they became friends and had family relations.</P>
<P>17. When Warraich started his renovation business in 2008, he assisted Choudhry, between 2008 and 2011, who was an electrician, visited the properties under renovation and learnt his craft from the certified electrician hired by Warraich.</P>
<P>18. Later, in 2011, Choudhry after obtaining his license, worked as an electrician on the construction sites of Warraich and Waheed Akhtar. Choudhry worked for approximately five projects for Warraich, based on verbal contracts.</P>
<P>19. From about 2009 onwards, Warraich along with his friends/business colleagues purchased several properties based on verbal agreements in the name of friends/business partners. Each partner contributed in accordance with his respective share and following renovation and sale, the net sale proceeds were divided in accordance with the share. The Agreements were always verbal and there was never any issue as parties trusted each other.</P>
<P>20. Choudhry was well aware of these verbal contracts as he worked as an electrician on these properties and all of his contracts for electrical work were verbal contracts.</P>
<P>22. In March 2012, Choudhry purchased [location omitted]and the same time, he sold his home in Richmond Hill ON. The deal for the sale of his home fell through and Choudhry was faced with carrying two mortgages.</P>
<P>23. Warraich testified that Choudhry offered him 50% beneficial ownership in the Machockie Property in exchange for 50% of the Acquisition costs and 50% of the carrying cost of the property. Warraich was to obtain and pay for permits of the Property. Following renovations, the Property was to be sold in the Market and the net sale proceeds divided between the parties.</P>
<P>24. Warraich accepted the offer pursuant to the Verbal Agreement, and along with his family moved into the Property in April 2012. The parties agreed that Warraich would pay the market rent for the Property and they, will share all the carrying costs on a 50-50 basis.</P>
<P>25. Warraich testified that he moved in and lived as a beneficial owner without any Residential Tenancy Agreement. He has paid the carrying costs of the Property from April 2012 to date. He obtained permits for the property and paid the sum of $20,025.88 to LEMCAD consultants to obtain permits for the Property. By April 2013, he paid $62,000.00 as the acquisition costs.</P>
<P>26. Warraich testified that Choudhry was a partner with him in [location omitted]Property and that he paid about $90,000.00 to Choudhry for his investment and profit following the sale of the Waterloo Property. Warraich provided bank drafts and cheques for the transaction.</P>
<P>27. Warraich testified that in late 2013, Aftab visited his house and asked him to sign a residential tenancy agreement and told him that he required that agreement either for tax purposes or for showing more income for his mortgage renewal. Warraich testified that at the relevant time, the brother of Choudhry, Ashfaq Choudhry acted as his accountant. Waraich consulted Ashfaq. Warraich testified that Ashfaq told him to sign the agreement as it was only for tax purposes.</P>
<P>28. In or around April 2016, Choudhry indicated that he wanted to by the ownership share of Warraich. They negotiated and in April 2016 and had disagreement on the sum that Choudhry wanted to deduct as real estate commission.</P>
<P>29. Finally, in May 2016 with the help of a mutual friend, Waheed Akhtar determined that the commission to be deducted should be about 3% ($23,000.00). Thereafter, the parties reached an agreement whereby following adjustments, each partner's share was determined to be $184,500. The partner who wanted to keep the property had to pay for the development costs. Choudhry was to pay Warraich the $20,000.00 dollars Warraich had paid to LEMCAD Choudhry paid that amount less the market rent that Warraich had refused to pay. The payment was to be made by Choudhry by August 10, 2016. When payment was not made by Choudhry by August 10, 2016, the relationship became tense.</P>
<P>30. On September 1, 2016, there was an exchange of messages between Warraich and Choudhry where Warraich asserted his ownership rights. In the text messages there was never a denial by Choudhry that Warraich did not have any ownership rights. Choudhry did not respond to the messages of the Warraich. However, he never once stated in writing that Warraich did not have an ownership interest in the Property.</P>
<P>31. On September 2, 2016 both Choudhry and Warraich attended to the home office of Leo Mastandrea, who reduced to the Agreement to writing. Both parties signed the Agreement. Leo Mastandrea also signed the Agreement. The parties agreed that Warraich will send documents to the lawyer of Choudhry for the grant of mortgage by Choudhry in lieu of the ownership share of Warraich.</P>
<P>32. Warraich had instructed his lawyer to send the mortgage documents to the lawyer for Choudhry. In late September 2016, the documents were sent. Choudhry refused to sign the documents and asked for access to die Property for his appraiser. Warraich refused, asserted his rights, and threatened litigation. Warraich put a caution on the title of the property.</P>
<P>33. Warraich commenced a statement of Claim and Choudhry countered by not only defending the claim but also commenced eviction proceedings in the Landlord Tenant Board.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF WAHEED AKHTAR</TI>
<P>34. Waheed Akhtar testified he knew of the partnership of Warraich and Choudhry in [location omitted]. He confirmed that parties had close family relations. He further testified that Choudhry had worked for him on about 8 properties all pursuant to verbal contracts.</P>
<P>35. Waheed Akhtar confirmed that he helped parties negotiate the contract of September 02, 2016. He further testified that he was given a copy of the written contract of September 02, 2016 by Warraich and that the terms were the same that he had helped negotiate. Waheed testified that Choudhry offered to provide in writing to him (Waheed) that he will pay Warraich the sum of $184,500. However, it was his testimony that Choudhry did not want to sign the mortgage documents or any legal documents for the money that he acknowledged he owed to Warraich.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF LEO MASTANDREA</TI>
<P>36. Leo testified that he has dealt with Warraich since 2012 for the Property and that he only met Mr. Choudhry in 2015, well over two years after he had commenced work on the Property on the instructions of Warraich.</P>
<P>37. Leo testified that he was paid $20,000.00 for the costs of permits of the Property by Warraich. Leo also testified that when Choudhry first met him in 2015, Warraich introduced him as his partner.</P>
<P>38. Leo confirmed that he wrote die agreement of September 2012 at the instructions and in the presence of both Warraich and Choudhry. He was clear that the Agreement was for the separation of the interest of Warraich and Choudhry in the Property and that it was not a construction contract. Leo was calm and provided clear and coherent answers during his cross-examination.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF SHAHID AWAN</TI>
<P>39. Shahid Awan confirmed that he provided two cheques one of $10,000.00 and of $37,000.00 to Choudhry at the direction of Warraich and that he did not owe any money to Choudhry at the time and that it was not payment for any electrical work.</P>
<P>40. Shahid Awan testified that he met Choudhry Ashfaq, the brother of Choudhry Aftab in October 2016 to resolve the dispute. Shahid testified that Ashfaq never represented that Warraich did not have an ownership interest in the Property. The only issue was that Aftab did not want to sign any legal documents. Shahid Awan was able to provide coherent answers during his cross-examination.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF ZAHEER AHMED</TI>
<P>41. Zaheer Ahmed testified that in April 2013, he sent a blank residential tenancy agreement to Choudhry. The residential tenancy agreement form that was filled out and signed by Warraich matches word by word with the form that was sent by Zaheer Ahmed. Zaheer Ahmed was coherent and sincere during his examination as well as cross-examination</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT CHOUDHRY</TI>
<P>42. Choudhry testified that he has been friends with Warraich since 2000 and that they were family friends. He confirmed that he has always conducted his business with Warraich based on verbal agreement.</P>
<P>43. Choudhry denied that Warraich had any verbal agreement testified that Warraich was a tenant and that he was a landlord in [location omitted] He also denied that he had any partnership with Warraich in the [location omitted] property.</P>
<P>44. Choudhry produced excel spread sheets showing transactions between him and Warraich. He could not produce any bank drafts, cheques or certified cheques that totaled the sum of $192,000.00.</P>
<P>45. Choudhry testified that that the contract of September 02, 2016 was actually a contract for the construction of a 2439 Sq. ft home that Warraich was to construct for him.</P>
<P>46. It was his testimony that the $20,000.00 that Warraich had paid to Leo were money that Warraich owed on account of missed rental payments. He could not remember as to why many months he Warraich had missed rental payments.</P>
<P>47. He admitted to lying to Revenue Canada on his tax returns and declaring the rental income of $1,600.00 when he received $2,000.00 from Warraich. He further admitted that he lied to the appraiser about the rent and utilities of the Property in order to obtain a higher appraisal.</P>
<P>48. Choudhry testified that although he did not need money, he received a cheque of $50,000.00 from Warraich in January 2016 as a loan. He could not explain as to why he received the money when did not need the money.</P>
<P>49. Choudhry admitted that he did not disclose to the Member LTB that Warraich was living at the Property since April 2012 and stated that the residential tenancy Agreement commenced on March 1, 2013.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>TESTIMONY OF ASHFAQ CHOUDHRY</TI>
<P>50. Ashfaq Choudhry testified that he acted as the accountant of Warraich and Choudhry during the relevant period. He denied that he advised Warraich to sign the residential tenancy agreement. He testified that the Residential Tenancy Agreement was filled out by him according to the instructions of his brother and that it was signed by Warraich in his present in the basement of the Property.</P>
<P>51. He contradicted his earlier testimony in LTB hearing where he had testified that</P>
<P>52. It was his testimony that he never discussed the ownership issue with Shahid Awan and that when that when presented the residential tenancy agreement, Warraich laughed after looking at the Agreement. It was his testimony that Warraich paid the cash $2000.00 in his presence.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>WHY PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS SHOULD BE PREFERRED OVER DEFENDANT'S WITNESSES.</TI>
<P>53. The Plaintiff recalled all events clearly and coherently. He was calm collected and answered questions intelligibly and sensibly. He dealt with issues succinctly and was able to address concerns arising from issues. Choudhry on the other hand did not provide clear answer to clear question. He provided long and unnecessary explanations unrelated to the questions.</P>
<P>54. Warraich provided credible evidence during cross-examination. He was calm and unperturbed. While the Warraich was able to narrate his story in a matter of fact manner. Choudhry resorted to long wined explanations. Choudhry contracted his own testimony regarding the under declaration of rent that he gave during his discovery. In addition, he admitted to lying to Revenue Canada as well as to the appraiser who he sent for the appraisal of the property.</P>
<P>55. Choudhry could not explain as to why he did not disclose to the LTB Member that Warraich lived at the Property since April 2012, without any rental agreement. Similarly, he did not disclose this fact in his Statement of Defence and counterclaim, his affidavit for the motion before the Superior Court or in the notice of Motion of his lawyer. All these documents stated that the tenancy began on March 1, 2013.</P>
<P>56. It is reasonable to infer that if Choudhry could lie for a few hundred dollars, he would lie for $200,000.00 or so. In addition, his explanation for the Agreement of September 02, 2016 did not make any sense. His testimony was contracted by three other witness, being Warraich, Waheed Akhtar and Leo Mastandrea and Shahid Awan.</P>
<P>57. The evidence provided by Choudhry did not accord with common sense. It was not consistent with other evidence provided by various arm's length third party witnesses.</P>
<P>58. Choudhry has huge stakes in the outcome of this litigation. Hence, his testimony has to be considered in the light of his skin in the game.</P>
<P>59. Choudhry did not come across as a sincere and honest witness who wanted to assist the court in reaching a resolution based on evidence and truth.</P>
<P>60. The only other witness who supported the testimony of Aftab Choudhry was his brother Ashfaq Choudhry. It is reasonable to assume that he will have an inherent bias. In fact, he tried to be more loyal than the king and actually testified that he the deposit for the rental agreement was paid in his presence when even Choudhry had not provided that testimony.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>III- If part performance is established what is the appropriate remedy;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">IV-LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Statute of Fraud</TI>
<P>62. The purpose of the 340-year-old <EM>Statute of Frauds</EM> originally enacted in England on April 16, 1677, was to eliminate the fraud and perjury in proving claims to land that was widespread in England in the 17<SUP>th</SUP> century.

<BLOCK4><TI>THE TEST FOR PART PERFORMANCE</TI>
<BLOCK5><TI>DEGLMAN TEST</TI>
<P>63. <UNDER>The Ontario Court of Appeal in Erie Sand at paragraph 79 noted;</UNDER>
<QUOTE><P>[79] Furthermore, in my view, the Proposition flows from the conflation of two distinct, albeit related, aspects of the doctrine of part performance. <BOLD><EM>The first aspect</EM></BOLD> is detrimental reliance which, as has been noted, requires a party to prove its acts of performance. Without detrimental reliance there can be no inequity in relying on the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER>, thus, it is the first hurdle to be met. <BOLD><EM>The second aspect</EM></BOLD> of the doctrine, however, relates to Equity's requirement that the acts of part performance sufficiently indicate the existence of the alleged contract such that the party alleging the agreement is permitted to adduce evidence of the oral agreement... For the purpose of this discussion, it is significant to note that these two aspects of the doctrine are not synonymous. <BOLD>The former is a matter of substantive law based on the rationale for the doctrine of part performance, whereas the latter is primarily evidentiary in nature. [See Note 17 below]</BOLD></P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>Erie Sand and Gravel Limited v. Tri-B Acres Inc</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 709 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo; Erie Sand&rdquo;) at paragraph 79 Plaintiff Book of Authorities (PBOA) at Tab-6</P>
<P>The ratio decidendi of the Ontario Court of Appeal where it differentiates the Rand Test and the Deglman Test requires consideration. The Court held at paragraph 87;</P>
<P>[87] Cartwright J. delivered the majority judgment. [See Note 23 below] Like Rand J., he found that none of Mr. Constantineau's acts had a connection to No. 548 Besserer Street or to any dealing with that land. However, <BOLD><EM>he took a different view of what connection had to exist between the acts of part performance and the alleged oral agreement. Where Rand J. would have required the conduct to be referable only to the specific contract that had been alleged, Cartwright J. held that it was sufficient if the acts were &ldquo;unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Deglman test&rdquo;)</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>[92] In Haskett, as in the present case, the question was whether acts of part performance took an oral agreement outside the operation of the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER>. Because the case predated Deglman, this court followed English law and applied the Rand test. [See Note 25 below] <BOLD><EM>It will be recalled that the Rand test is significantly more stringent than the Deglman test because the Rand [page264] test would require the acts to be referable only to the alleged contract and no other, whereas the Deglman test requires only that the acts be referable to &ldquo;some dealing with the land&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>[94] There is much to be said for the commonsensical approach taken in Haskett. Based on that but modified to reflect the less stringent Deglman test, in my view, the proper approach to making such a determination is this. Begin by determining the context (or the &ldquo;relevant circumstances&rdquo; to use Haskett terminology). Then consider the acts of part performance having regard to the way in which reasonable people carry on their affairs. Indeed, although not stated explicitly, based on a full reading of the trial judge's reasons, he followed such an approach</P></QUOTE></P>

<QUOTE><P><BOLD>82</BOLD> Gillese J.A. also made it clear that the acts of part performance need not be &ldquo;referable only to the contract alleged&rdquo;. Rather, the test as established by the majority judgment of Cartwright J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Deglman v. Brunet Estate</SOC><CITE>[1954] S.C.R.

<P>65. The Ontario Court of Appeal, while it appears to follow the <CASEREF><SOC>Maddison v Alderson</SOC></CASEREF> test by adopting Cartwright J's majority judgment in <EM>Deglman</EM>, its understanding of that test is not stringent and indeed the test in Ontario appears to be even more lenient than the test in <CASEREF><SOC>Steadman v Steadman</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>59. To sum up, it is our submission, that the ONCA clarified the test when it asked the Court asked the rhetorical question regarding the part performance in paragraph 88 and then went on to answer the questions it had posed.
<QUOTE><P>[88] Thus, the question becomes: are the acts of part performance as found by the trial judge <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the [south side property]&rdquo;?</EM></BOLD></P>
<P>[89] In answering this question, the <BOLD><EM>first step is to determine whether the acts of part performance are connected to the land</EM>.</BOLD> In this regard, the conduct in the present case stands in marked contrast to that in Deglman. In Deglman, it will be recalled, the acts of performance consisted of Mr. Constantineau doing chores on two properties, driving his aunt about and doing her personal errands&mdash;<BOLD>those acts are not referable to any particular piece of property.</BOLD> In this case, however, each act of part performance relates directly to the south side property. The Offer recites that it is for the south side property; the deposit, on which more is said later, is tied to the Offer; and the reason that Seres' Farms took the Offer to Tri-B is the right of first refusal over the south side property. <BOLD><EM>Thus, it is undeniable that each of the acts of part performance relates to the south side property. Put another way, the conduct is unequivocally referable in its own nature to the south side property</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>[90] However, it is not sufficient that the conduct is unequivocally referable to the property in question; the conduct must also, in and of itself, indicate that there had been <BOLD>&ldquo;some dealing with the land&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. Thus, the law in Ontario merely requires that the acts point to a contract concerning the land in dispute</P>
<BLOCK6><TI>DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE</TI>
<P>67. The ONCA in Erie Sand further held;
<QUOTE><P>[64] Hill stands for this principle: if one party to an otherwise unenforceable agreement stands by while the other party acts to its detriment by performance of its contractual obligations, the first party will be precluded from relying on the requirements in the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER> to excuse its own performance. As I will explain, application of this principle leads to the conclusion that Seres' Farms is precluded from relying on <UNDER>s. 4</UNDER> of the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER> to excuse it from performance of its obligations under the Agreement. Further, in the circumstances of this case, Tri-B cannot stand in a better position than Seres' Farms</P>
<P>[70] In conclusion, Equity will intervene because it would be unconscionable for the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER> to be used when Erie acted to its detriment by irremediably carrying out its obligations under the otherwise unenforceable contract. Equity devised the doctrine of part performance to remedy precisely this kind of situation&mdash;it will not stand by and allow the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER> to be used as &ldquo;an engine of fraud&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK6></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Is the doctrine of part performance limited to a consideration of acts of the plaintiff?</TI>
<P>68. The court in Erie Sand held that that the act of both the parties ought to be considered. At paragraph 72 and 75 it held as follows;
<QUOTE><P>[72] Again, Hill is a complete answer to this argument. In Hill, the plaintiffs [See Note 13 below] were Mr. Hill's sons, the successors in title to his farmland. The respondent&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the party to be [page258] charged&rdquo; [See Note 14 below]&mdash;was the province. In finding that the requirements of the doctrine of part performance had been met, the Supreme Court relied primarily on the acts of the province in constructing and maintaining the access ramps, rather than on acts of the plaintiffs. In fact, the only act of the plaintiffs that is referred to is Mr. Hill's reliance on the province's promise.</P>
<P>[75] In sum, it appears to me that given the decision of the Supreme Court in Hill, it is now settled law in Canada that the acts of both parties to an alleged oral agreement may be considered when a court is called on to determine if sufficient acts of part performance take an alleged agreement outside the operation of the <UNDER>Statute of Frauds</UNDER>. I am fortified in this conclusion by two considerations.</P></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK4><TI>MOUNTAIN AND MOUNTAIN</TI>
<P>69. In a more recent case in 2012, <CASEREF><SOC>Mountain v. Mountain</SOC></CASEREF> the court reversed the trial judge's decision citing errors concerning the doctrine of part performance:
<QUOTE><P>Winkler, C.J.O. held [at para. 78] that the trial Judge had erred in the application of the legal test for part performance and in treating Gary as though he were &ldquo;... a farmhand&mdash;and an overpaid one at that&mdash;when in reality, Gary and Jack acted in partners in a family business&rdquo;, stating, para. 79 to 83:
<QUOTE><P>[79] In setting forth the governing legal principles, the trial judge held, at para. 107, that the acts of part performance that Gary needed to prove were those of Gary's, not Jack's. He also held that &ldquo;those acts must be consistent with only the alleged contract.&rdquo; The trial judge's statement of the law is 4 wrong in two respects.</P>
<P>[80] In <CASEREF><SOC>Erie Sand and Gravel Ltd. v. Seres' Farms Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 709 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2009 ONCA 709</CITE></CORRELAT><CORRELAT><CITE>97 O.R. (3d) 241</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Gillese J.A. clarified the legal principles that apply when determining whether there is an oral agreement respecting land, and if so, whether there are sufficient acts of part performance to take the oral agreement outside s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. As explained in Erie Sand, at para. 49, the doctrine of part performance is a creation of equity. The doctrine was created:</P>
<P>.........to prevent the Statute of Frauds from being used as a variant of the unconscionable dealing which it was designed to remedy: see <CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>1997 CanLII 401</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1977] 1 S.C.R. 69</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>. The requirements in s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds must give way in the face of part performance because the acts of part performance fulfill the very purpose of the written document&mdash;that is, they diminish the opportunity for fraudulent dealings with land based on perjured evidence. [81] Gillese J.A. made it clear, at para. 75, that the doctrine of part performance is not limited to a consideration of the acts of the plaintiff: In sum, it appears to me that given the decision of the Supreme Court in Hill, it is now settled law in Canada that the acts of both parties to an alleged oral agreement may be considered when a court is called on to determine if sufficient acts of part performance take an alleged agreement outside the operation of the Statute of Frauds.</P>
<P>[82] Gillese J.A. also made it clear that the acts of part performance need not be &ldquo;referable only to the contract alleged&rdquo;. Rather, the test as established by the ma jority judgment of Cartwright J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Deglman v. Brunet Estate</SOC><CITE>1954 CanLII 2</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1954] S.C.R. 725</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 733</PAGENUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, is that it is sufficient if the acts are &ldquo;unequivocally referable in their own nat ure to some dealing with the land.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[83] The trial judge erred in law in holding that the only relevant acts of part performance are those of Gary. He further erred in stating that Gary's acts must be consistent only with the alleged contract.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>With respect to the work Gary did on the farm, Winkler, C.J.O. stated, at para. 89, 91, 92 and 95:
<QUOTE><P>[89] In assessing the evidence before him, the trial judge failed to apply the common-sense approach described in Erie Sands. Again, this was a family 5 far ming operation. The trial judge did not take into account that Gary had devoted his working life to this family enterprise and that he did so not as an employee but as a partner with his father. This course of conduct was capable of constituting detrimental reliance on Gary's part. Yet the trial judge overlooked this reliance and engaged in an evidentiary analysis that was inapposite to the circumstances at hand.</P>
<P>[91] In focusing on whether Gary had been underpaid for his full-time work on the farm for the 24 years that he worked with Jack, the trial judge lost sight of the elementary fact that Jack and Gary, father and son, were operating the farm together as more or less equals.</P>
<P>[92] There can be no question on this record that Jack and Gary were engaged in the farming operation together and that it was not on an employer-employee basis, nor was it an arms-length relationship. Gary was not treated by his father as a mere farm hand, nor did he conduct himself as such. Gary received cattle from his father at no expense or at less than market value. He had access to the feed account, authority to order and pay for commodities, and had authority over the farming financial arrangements. Their relationship was not formalized, but in the circumstances, this is not surprising.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[95] The trial judge's failure to appreciate the relevant circumstances&mdash;particularly the nature of the relationship between Jack and Gary in their operation of the farm&mdash;led him to disregard evidence that was capable of showing part performance.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>71. LAW THAT SUPPORTS THEORY</P>
<BLOCK4><TI>ACTS OF PART PERFOMANCE</TI>
<P><BOLD>( a)</BOLD> Warraich paid the sum of $62,000.00 as acquisition costs. This payment is unequivocally referable to the verbal contract dealing with land.</P>
<P>(b) These payments were acts of part performance and it cannot be characterized as a lease payment, payment for repairs etc.,</P>
<P>(c) There is no cogent evidence that this money that has been provided to Choudhry was in fact a loan owed to Choudhry. Please refer to paragraph 32 of the Erie Sand;</P>
<P>(d) Choudhry through his own email provided a confirmation for the receipt of monies. The money is part of the accounting for [location omitted]Property. The monies in the email of Choudhry and the accounting for[location omitted]all match.</P>
<P>(e) The payment of $20,000.00 to LEMCAD for obtaining the permit is dearly for the Property and obtaining the permits for the Property;</P>
<P>(f) Warraich dealt with LEMCAD as an owner and Choudhry only met Leo well over two years after the commencement of the permit work.</P>
<P>(g) the carrying costs of the Property were clearly for the Property. Although it could be characterized as rent, the text message for bill share, supports the testimony of Warraich that it was the carrying costs of the Property.</P>
<P>(h) Based on the context, in the back drop of the verbal partnership for various properties and Choudhry's involvement and knowledge of these arrangements and the timing of various payments made to Choudhry, it is reasonable to find that there was verbal agreement concerning the Property between Warraich and Choudhry.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI>WRITTEN CONTRACT</TI>
<P>The written contract has all the elements of a binding contract. It has the price, the parties and the property, (being $184,500.0) as the share of each partner.</P>
<P>(i) That agreement is a sufficient note or memoranda to the meet the writing requirement of S.4 of the Statute of Frauds</P>
<P>(j) This completely validates the verbal contract.</P>
<P>(j) Leo who wrote the agreement testified that he understood that the written agreement was for the separation of the interest of the parties. Thus, the contention that the Agreement was for separation of the ownership share is supported by cogent evidence.</P>
<P>(k) Choudhry allowed Warraich to deal with Leo to obtain permits etc. He benefited while Warraich spent money and time on obtaining permits. He cannot be allowed to deny the contract under which he obtained the benefit. The Court in Erie at paragraph 58 Noted:</P>
<P>(l) As further noted in paragraph 56:
<QUOTE><P>[56] In Cory J.'s view, the actions of the province were extremely telling: &ldquo;The actions of the province speak louder than any written document.&rdquo; Similarly, the actions of Choudhry speak louder than his testimony.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>(m) [58] In para. 10 of Hill, Cory J. explains why Equity created the doctrine of part performance. He does so by quoting the following from <CASEREF><SOC>Steadman v.

<QUOTE><P>[This doctrine] was evoked when, almost from the moment of passing of the Statute of Frauds, it was appreciated that it was being used for a variant of unconscionable dealing, which the statute itself was designed to remedy. A party to an oral contract for the disposition of an interest in land could, despite performance of the reciprocal terms by the other party, by virtue of the statute disclaim liability for his own performance on the ground that the contract had not been in writing. Common Law was helpless. But Equity, with its purpose of vindicating good faith and with its remedies of injunction and specific performance, could deal with the situation.... Where, therefore, a party to a contract unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds stood by while the other party acted to his detriment in performance of his own contractual obligations, the first party would be precluded by the Court of Chancery from claiming exoneration, on the ground that the contract was unenforceable, from performance of his reciprocal obligations; and the court would, if required, decree specific performance of the contract. Equity would not, as it was put, allow the Statute of Fraud &ldquo;to be used as an engine of fraud.&rdquo; This became known as the doctrine of part performance&mdash;the &ldquo;part&rdquo; performance being that of the party who had, to the knowledge of the other party, acted to his detriment in carrying out irremediably his own obligations (or some significant part of them) under the otherwise unenforceable contract.

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>NOTICE OF MOTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>The Defendants, Afiab Ahmad Choudhry and Yasmin Nuzhat, will make a motion to a Judge on January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 at 10:00 in the forenoon or as soon thereafter as the motion can be heard at 393 University Ave. Toronto.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION WILL BE HEARD:</BOLD> orally.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR AN ORDER:</BOLD>
<P1>a) Terminating the tenancy between the parties;</P1>
<P1>b) An order that the plaintiff and his family vacate the property owned by the defendants;</P1>
<P1>c) In the alternative, if this Honourable Court should allow the plaintiff and his family to stay and reside in the premises, then an Order in the form of an interlocutory mandatory injunction that the plaintiff pay up immediately the arrears of rent and pay the amount of rent as set out in the lease agreement ;</P1>
<P1>d) Or in the further alternative, pay the defendants occupancy costs equal to the mortgage and taxes, and maintenance of the property until trial;</P1>
<P1>e) Costs of this motion.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD>
<P1>a) Rule 40.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</P1>
<P1>b) Sections 101, 102 of the Courts of Justice Act.</P1>
<P1>c) The defendants are the owners of a property at [location omitted] They purchased the property entirely with their own money without any contribution by the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>d) The defendants entered a lease arrangement in 2013 with the plaintiff whereby the plaintiff and his family paid rent and utilities for the property. The plaintiff stopped paying rent as of June 2016 and is in arrears.</P1>
<P1>e) The plaintiff is an experienced contractor and was to be engaged by the defendants to take on a renovation project for their property. Terms were agreed upon as to price and the plaintiff agreed in writing to move out by October 4, 2016 which would have been the commencement date for the project.</P1>
<P1>f) The plaintiff failed to move out and remains on the property without paying any rent.</P1>
<P1>g) The plaintiff has alleged that he is not a tenant but rather an owner, by way of constructive or resulting trust and alleges that he contributed to the acquisition of the property.</P1>
<P1>h) The allegations set out in the Claim fly in the face of the documents signed by the parties.</P1>
<P1>i) The defendants have filed a Notice of Eviction and intend to proceed before the Landlord and Tenant Board but the Statement of Claim alleges that the Board should not have any jurisdiction as the plaintiff alleges that he is not a tenant but rather an &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>j) The defendants must pay mortgage payments on their property of over $2,000 per month. They cannot continue to do so without receiving rental income as they have in the past 3 years from the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>k) Without receiving any income their own mortgage would go into default and they would be a Notice of Sale pursuant to the mortgage and the defendants could lose their entire investment in this property.</P1>
<P1>l) It would be unjust to allow the plaintiff to remain on this property rent free and with no obligations to pay while at the same time the defendants are forced to pay their mortgage.</P1>
<P1>m) There is urgency to this matter. The balance of convenience favours the defendants and not the plaintiff.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE TO BE RELIED UPON AT THE MOTION IS:</BOLD>
<P1>a) The affidavit of Aftab Choudhry and exhibits attached thereto.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF AFTAB AHMED CHOUDHRY</TI>
<P>I, Aftab Choudhry, of the City of Toronto, make oath and say as follows:
<P1>1. I am a defendant in this action along with my wife, Nuzhat Yasmin . I make this affidavit on behalf of both of us since I have had all dealings with the plaintiff and as such have knowledge of the matters of this case.</P1>
<P1>2. I purchased the subject property in March 2012 with a view to live and developing a dream home to close downtown</P1>
<P1>3. There was no offer of ownership made and no agreement entered between me and the plaintiff about him owing any part of this property.</P1>
<P1>4. The cost of this property was in the amount of $523,452.43. I paid the entire amount as follows. The amount of the down payment was $108,252.43 and that money came from my resources.</P1>
<P1>5. The balance of $415,200 came by way of mortgage financing that I arranged with Scotia Bank. Attache hereto and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to this my affidavit is a copy of the trust ledger statement of Mr. Said Mohammedally, my lawyer for closing the deal and the Statement of Adjustments.</P1>
<P1>6. The reporting letter dated March 9,2012 for the purchase was sent to me and I attach that and mark that as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>7. I did not receive any money from the plaintiff for the purchase of this property.</P1>
<P1>8. The plaintiff asked me if he and his family could rent the property as they were seeking a place to rent at the time.</P1>
<P1>9. Since I had no immediate plans of demolish and building I agreed to lease the property and entered a landlord and tenant relationship.</P1>
<P1>10. A residential tenancy agreement was drafted and signed on March 1, 2013 whereby I was the landlord and the plaintiff the tenant. The lease was agreed to be month-to-month beginning on March 1st 2013. Rent was charged at $2000 per month and utilities were to be paid by the plaintiff. The lease was intended to be a &ldquo;complete record of the rental agreement of the parties and any agreements and undertakings between the parties must be included in writing to be binding&rdquo;. I attach hereto and mark as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; a copy of the tenancy agreement</P1>
<P1>11. The plaintiff paid the lease payments in accordance with the lease for the following three years,2013,2014,2015 and 2016 up to June, 2016.</P1>
<P1>12. I hired an architect for the purposes of drawing the plans and specifications for the proposed renovation, Mr. Leo Mastradrea.</P1>
<P1>13. Leo, on my instructions, began the process to obtain a building and demolition permit for the proposed renovation in 2015.</P1>
<P1>14. The plaintiff had general contracting experience and had renovated several homes and properties. I have known the plaintiff for many years and I have been witness to some of the projects that he worked on and therefore I trusted his ability and agreed to use him as a general contractor.</P1>
<P1>15. I sat down together with Leo and put on paper the basics of an agreement that set out our respective duties and obligations. It was always agreed that a more full and complete agreement would be drafted and entered between us. I attach hereto and mark as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; the hand-written note dated September 2, 2016 that was written by Leo which set out the discussions on the day that we agreed on the proposal.</P1>
<P1>16. Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; sets out the parameters and relationship of the parties. The agreement which will be discussed below makes it clear that we were not in any joint ownership relationship with respect to this property.</P1>
<P1>17. The first line of the agreement set out an interest rate of 3.5% and a &ldquo;lien&rdquo; on the property.</P1>
<P1>18. The reason for this was to establish that we were hiring the plaintiff as a general contractor for a stipulated price as set forth below and that the interest rate in relation to the amount of the contract was to be 3.5% and that he would be entitled to a security interest against the property to ensure he would be paid.</P1>
<P1>19. I intended to pay the plaintiff after he completed his work and until the plaintiff was paid, he was entitled to 3.5% interest of the value of the work done.</P1>
<P1>20. The next line contains the following numbers $204,500-20,000 = $7200-3 months 2400 =184,500 &ldquo;agreed amount&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>21. It was agreed that the price for contract services to construct the home up to &ldquo;drywall ready&rdquo; would be $204,500. The plaintiff wanted an advance from me in the amount of $20,000 towards the construction costs, and I had no problem with that request.</P1>
<P1>22. The amount of the rent plus utilities had been $2400 per month. By September 2016 the plaintiff was in arrears of his lease payments to me of three months for a total of $7,200. It was agreed that the $7,200 would be a set off and deduction from the $20,000 advance such that the net amount of the advance would be $12,800.</P1>
<P1>23. I paid him a cheque of that amount on September 2, 2016 and I attach that as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>24. The net amount therefore owed when he completed the project would be $184,500.</P1>
<P1>25. The next line contained the words &ldquo;will move out by October 4, 2016&rdquo;. That meant that the plaintiff agreed to move out of the premises when home building was going to begin and we agreed that an appropriate date would be October 4, 2016.</P1>
<P1>26. Safraz told me that he was completing his own home and that it would be ready for him and his family to move into by that date of October 4, 2016.</P1>
<P1>27. The next line contained the number $7,375-$1000 = 6375. The reference to those numbers are as showing from an invoice given to me by Leo. After a request by me to Leo, he agreed to reduce the invoice dated August 18, 2016 by $1000 discount. A cheque of $6,375 was then issued to Leo . That is also found on Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;. Leo's invoice is marked as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>28. I was satisfied with the terms of the agreement. The agreement set out the plaintiff was to be retained as a general contractor, the contract price and confirmed the amount of his arrears of rent. The agreement does not indicate any ownership interest of the plaintiff in the property.</P1>
<P1>29. After the discussions and agreement of September 2, 2016, I was waiting on receiving the permits so I could begin the project.</P1>
<P1>30. Then on September 23, 2016, I received a document entitled &ldquo;Charge/Mortgage&rdquo;. The plaintiff asked me to sign this mortgage. I refused because that was never the agreement. I did agree that he had a right to register a claim for lien on my property but I never agreed to give him a Ml mortgage registered against my property. That is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>31. I spoke to the plaintiff on the phone and told him I was not signing it. The plaintiff told that I better sign it or else I would regret not signing it and I still said no.</P1>
<P1>32. I did receive the permits on September 28, 2016 and I attach a copy of the permits as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>33. The next thing that the defendant knew was that the plaintiff registered a caution on title dated 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Oct 2016 purportedly seeking an interest in the property. I attach that caution as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>34. After that caution I realized that the plaintiff and his family were not going to move out. I called Enbridge to cancel the lock out instructions for the gas.</P1>
<P1>35. My reaction was to make an application for his eviction and I did so through the Landlord and Tenant Board who provided me with the date of December 7, 2016 for the hearing. The Notice is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>36. The plaintiff is in substantial arrears for rent. In addition to the months of July, August and September, there have been an additional two months and we are going into yet a third month such that he would not have paid rent for 6 full months.</P1>
<P1>37. I have a mortgage with the Bank of Nova Scotia to pay in the amount of $2129.00 I cannot afford to pay the mortgage with no rent payments paid to me.</P1>
<P1>38. In reading the Statement of Claim, I see that the plaintiff is suggesting to the Landlord and Tenant Board that they are not real tenants but rather actual owners be at by way of constructive trust or resulting trust or express or implied agreement as they have alleged in their Claim.</P1>
<P1>39. In their claim they have asked for a stay of the landlord and tenant proceedings and are suggesting that they are entitled to stay without having to pay any amount for rent or occupation.</P1>
<P1>40. That would result in severe consequence to me. I am advised that this case would not be able to come to court for trial for a minimum of between 1 to 2 years. If that is the case then I would lose the property if the plaintiff and his family were allowed to stay without having to pay any rent or occupation cost.</P1>
<P1>41. I am not able to pay the mortgage without receiving income from the property. It would result in a default in the first mortgage and a resulting power of sale proceeding. It could mean the end of my dream to build my dream home to live in .</P1>
<P1>42. Therefore, I have brought this motion on an urgent and interlocutory basis asking either that the plaintiff be evicted or in the alternative that the status quo be maintained and that he continue to pay pursuant to the lease as well as the payment of all arrears until trial.</P1></P>

<P>e. An order for directions for expedited scheduling the trial of this Action.</P>
<P>f. Costs of this motion, if opposed; and</P>
<P>g. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GOUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. The plaintiff commenced underlying Action for damages for unjust enrichment and breach of trust.</P>
<P>2. The plaintiff and the Defendants were family friends.</P>
<P>3. After purchasing the Property in March 2012, the defendant offered 50% of ownership to the plaintiff in exchange for 50% of the acquisition costs and 50% of the expenses for the Property.</P>
<P>4. Based on the verbal agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of $62,000.00, as 50% acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<P>5. Although the Title of the Property is the joint name of the defendants, who are spouses of each other, based on the Agreement, they hold the title of the property as a trustee as to the 50% interest of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>6. The plaintiff is living on the property with his family members since its purchase as of April 2012, as a co-owner, consistent with his position. He has been paying his 50% share of carrying costs.</P>
<P>7. Following negotiations, and intervention of third parties, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a written agreement dated September 2, 2017, wherein the plaintiff agreed to give a mortgage in the sum of $184,500.00 in exchange for the 50% ownership share of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>8. The defendant later reneged on that agreement and refused to sign the mortgage documents.</P>
<P>9. The disagreement of the parties resulted in this Action by the plaintiff and two applications by the defendants before Landlord and Tenant Board for eviction of the plaintiff and demolish the building, based on a purported Lease Agreement.</P>
<P>10. The plaintiff claims his signature were obtained based on fraud by the defendants.</P>
<P>11. After commencement of this Action, the defendants brought a motion to obtain vacant possession of the property by evicting the plaintiff.</P>
<P>12. On January 30, 2017, Justice Matheson ordered the plaintiff to pay $2,000.00 per month without prejudice to the rights of the parties and adjourned the defendants' motion. The plaintiff is fully in compliant with the said order.</P>
<P>13. The defendants abandoned their motion for further relief.</P>
<P>14. The defendants had attorned to the jurisdiction of this court and despite that the plaintiff was fully complying with the order of this court for payment of $2,000.00 per month, the defendants mislead the Board and obtained eviction order for the plaintiff for alleged default in payment of the purported rent.</P>
<P>15. The plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed the two Board orders before the Divisional Court. This motion is brought pursuant to the observation of the Divisional Court January 8, 2018 with respect to determination of the equitable interest of the parties which is in the exclusive jurisdiction of this court.</P>
<P>16. Though the underlying Actions has been set down for trial. However, the plaintiff is compelled to bring this motion because the defendants insist on the eviction of the plaintiff and his family from the property by making collateral attack on the order of this court of which the plaintiff is in full compliance.</P>
<P>17. It will be unfair to evict the plaintiff and his family without determining his rights. The family members of the plaintiff were not parties to the two applications before the Board. Nor, the co-defendant, NUZHAT YASMIN was the party to those applications.</P>
<P>18. The plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if he and his family members are evicted from the Property or the Property is demolished. It will lead to un-necessary complication, litigation and costs.</P>
<P>19. The balance of convenience favour granting the orders being sought.</P>
<P>20. There is no prejudice to the defendants, if the matter is decided on merits.</P>
<P>21. Section 101 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43; and Rule 1.04, 40 and 48 of the Rules of Civil Procedure;</P>
<P>22. Such further and other grounds as Counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of this motion:</P>
<P>1. Affidavit of SARFRAZ WARRAICH and the exhibits attached thereto.</P>
<P>2. Such other and further evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF SARFRAZ WARRAICH (Sworn May 25, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>Sarfraz Warraich</BOLD> of the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario make oath and say as follows.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>1. I am in the business of renovation of residential properties. I and the Defendant Aftab Chaudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rdquo;) had been friends for many years and we had family relations. We both originally belong to the same town of Gujarat in Pakistan.</P>
<P>2. As a result, I developed a relationship of trust with Aftab. As an electrician, Aftab also provided services for several properties owned by me or my associates.</P>
<P>3. In March 2012, Aftab and is wife Nuzhat Yasmine (&ldquo;Nuzhat&rdquo;) purchased [location omitted] (the &ldquo; Property &rdquo;). At the relevant time, they had sold their home,[location omitted] They had bridge financing for the purchase of the property.</P>
<P>4. The Sale of the Richmond Hill property fell and the defendant, who is an electrician by profession, had to bear the burden of carrying two properties. Aftab still resides at that property.</P>
<P>5. At that time, Aftab, approached me and offered me 50% ownership of the Property in exchange for 50% of the Acquisition costs and 50% of the carrying cost of the property.</P>
<P>6. I accepted the offer and we made a verbal agreement pursuant to which, in exchange for 50% acquisition costs, and 50% of the carrying costs, Aftab and Nuzhat held 50% of the title in trust for me. I along with my wife moved into the Property in April, 2012, without any Residential Tenancy Agreement as were the beneficial owners.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; are copies of the proof of living of the Plaintiff on the property since 2012.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>PROOF OF MONIES I PAID TO THE DEFENDANT</TI>
<P>7. Following the Agreement, In or about April 2012 I moved into the Property, with my wife and the children. We have lived in the property as beneficial owners and have made contributions to one half of the costs of the property.</P>
<P>8. I have paid 50% of the expenses from April 2012 to date. By April 2013, I paid Aftab $62,000.00 as one half of the acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; are copies of the cheques where I paid Aftab $62,000.00</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>RELATIONSHIP of Trust and Partnership in Waterloo Property</TI>
<P>9. Based on a verbal agreement, Aftab was a partner with me in the Waterloo Property.</P>
<P>10. Following the sale of the Waterloo Property, Aftab provided me an accounting of his investments and costs and I faithfully fulfilled my obligations and made payment to Aftab in the sum of $30,000.00 that included his investments as well as profits.</P>
<P>11. As set out above, we did not have any written contract with respect to our business transactions. Aftab was dependent on my good faith performance of my obligations with respect to the Waterloo Property. I fulfilled my promises in good faith and made payments to him as agreed in respect of</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; the copies of the cheque of payment to the Defendant for Waterloo, Property.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT OBTAINED BY AFTAB ON FRAUD</TI>
<P>12. As stated above, I along with my family have lived in the Property since April 2012. In or around, 2014, the Defendant, Choudhry made fraudulent misrepresentation to me that he requires a Residential Tenancy Agreement only for &ldquo;tax filing purposes&rdquo; as wanted to claim rental income.</P>
<P>13. I sought the advice of my accountant at the time, (who is also the brother of the Defendant). My accountant, Mr. Ishfaq Chaudhry advised me that there is no harm in signing the Residential Tenancy Agreement as it is only for tax purposes.</P>
<P>14. Relying on the advice of the accountant, and trusting the Defendant, I signed the tenancy agreement in 2014. The Defendant later fraudulently changed the date to March 2013. The Defendant has sole reliance on an Agreement that has been obtained on Fraud and the testimony of his brother.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; is the copy of Lease Agreement</BOLD></P>
<P>15. The Residential Tenancy Agreement, which he obtained on fraud is the sole evidence by which Aftab want to deny my rights including the payment of $62,000.00 and Sworn testimony of 4 witness excluding me. Apart from his brother, Aftab does not have a single witness to support his fraudulent position.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>BREAKDOWN OF RELATIONSHIP</TI>
<P>In the summer of 2016, I and Aftab negotiated to separate our mutual ownership interests in the Property. After several rounds of negotiations, we could not agree on the valuation of the Property. Due to the obstructionist conduct of the Defendant, in or around August 2016, I stopped payment of the shared expenses, respecting he costs of the property, for two months.</P>
<P>16. Finally, after the intervention of third parties, Aftab and I reached a written Agreement on September 02, 2016.</P>
<P>17. According to the written agreement dated September 2, 2016, after taking into account the current market value of the Property less the outstanding mortgage, Aftab agreed that $204,500.00 my share in the Property. Taking into account adjustments between us for all expenses related to the Property, Choudhry agreed to grant me a mortgage in the sum of $184, 500.00</P>
<P>18. For faithful performance of this agreement, I demanded a deposit of $20,000.00. After deducting 50% of the Property expenses for three months, the Defendants, provided me a cheque for $12,800.00 as deposit for the written agreement dated September 2, 2016.</P>
<P>19. The defendants clearly admitted my beneficial ownership in the property and agreed to grant me a mortgage in the sum of $184,000.00.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the Written Agreement and the Cheque provided by the Defendants.</BOLD></P>
<P>20. Relying on the written Agreement, I instructed my lawyer to send mortgage documents to the lawyer for the Defendants for the grant of the mortgage and execution of the documents by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Choudhry for the agreed amount due to me by the defendants.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; is the mortgage documents sent to the lawyer for the Defendants.</BOLD></P>
<P>21. Aftab reneged on the written Agreement as well. Aftab informed me that will first refinance the property and then sign the mortgage documents.</P>
<P>22. I knew that after refinance, there would be no equity left in the Property which would have seriously prejudiced my interest. Following the refusal of the Defendant to sign the mortgage documents, my lawyer once again sent the letter to the Lawyer of the Defendants asking them to fulfill their promise, but to no avail.</P>
<P>23. In view of the untrustworthy conduct of the Defendants, I registered a caution on the tide of the property and also issued a Statement of Claim.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; is the Notice of Caution registered on land</BOLD></P>
<P>24. On Nov 1, 2016, I commenced this Action against the defendants and served it on the defendants.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; is the Statement of Claim.</BOLD></P>
<P>25. On Nov 7, 2016, the defendants served me with their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>MOTION OF AFTAB IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE</TI>
<P>26. Aftab brought a motion in the Superior court for an injunction which among other things, requested occupation rent.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is the Notice of Motion by the Defendant</BOLD></P>
<P>27. Justice Matheson, in her endorsement ordered that I pay $2,000.00 per month until the matter is deal with on the merits. Justice Matheson noted there will be proper account of the sums and that these payments are without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is in compliance with the order of Justice Matheson.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; is the endorsement of Madam Justice Matheson</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>CONCURRENT LITIGATION COMMENCED BY THE DEFENDANTS IN THE LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD, (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;);</TI>
<P>25. Despite having obtained the relief they had sought, and while the matter is pending before the Superior Court, the Defendants commenced two Applications before the Landlord and Tenant Board. One application was for eviction on the basis of non-payment of rent and the other one was based on the Demolition of the Property.</P>
<P>28. I was unable to attend the LTB hearing as I had a doctor's appointment that day and lawyer was out of the country at the time. Aftab, misled the Member in his sworn statement before LTB and claimed that I had been living at the property since September 2013, as we written in the Fraudulent Lease Agreement. He never informed the Member that I was living at the Property since April 2012.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo; is the copy of doctor's office slip.</BOLD></P>
<P>29. The Member LTB citing prejudice to the Landlord, refused to grant an adjournment to the agent who attended my behalf and ordered my eviction, solely on the Residential Tenancy Agreement and the uncontested evidence of Aftab.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo; is the order of the LTB on the L-1 Application</BOLD></P>
<P>30. The Same LTB Member continued to hear the Demolition Application and reached the same result.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo; is the order of the LTB on the L-2 Application</BOLD></P>
<P>31. I appealed both the orders of the LTB Member to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court dismissed my Appeal on the technical grounds that an appeal can only succeed on a question of law only. However, at Paragraph 21 affirmed my right to apply to this court for Stay of the eviction, for which I have commenced this Motion.</P>
<P>The Divisional Court also held at paragraph 15 that &ldquo;..Conversely, the Superior Court has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim of an equitable ownership interest in the property.&rdquo;</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo; is the Decision of Divisional Court</BOLD></P>
<P>32. For the record, as beneficial owner of the property, I, along with my family have living at the property since April 2012 prior to the dubious Tenancy agreement dated March 2013;</P>
<P>33. I have paid my own half of the acquisition costs. I have provided proof of the payments that Aftab admits he has received. I have meritorious Claim and my substantive rights are at issue and the proper court to determine those issues is the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>34. If the injunction is not granted I will be deprived of my rights against which I will have no recourse and I will suffer irreparable harm. I and my family will be dislocated and disposed of my rights when those are pending determination before the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo; is the Eviction Notice of the Sheriff</BOLD></P>
<P>35. If this Honourable Court grants an injunction prohibiting my eviction, I hereby undertake to Indemnify the Defendants against any losses resulting from the grant of this injunction.</P>
<P>36. I am advised by counsel that I verily believe to be true that instead of agreeing to reasonable requests, the Defendant's counsel has not cooperated when the matter involves the substantive rights of all of my family members.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo; are email between my counsel and the Defendant's counsel</BOLD></P>
<P>I make this affidavit in support of my position on this motion and in rebuttal of the relief the defendants have requested and for no other purpose.</P>
<P>I make this affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<P>I, Leo Mastrandrea, (&ldquo;Leo&rdquo;) of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. My name is Leo. I own and manage a consultancy business namely LEMCAD Consultant. I have known Sarfraz Warraich since the Year 2010 and as such, I have personal knowledge of the matters herein deposed.</P>
<P>2. I have worked with Sarfraz on many construction projects in GTA. In the Year-2012, Sarfraz come to my office and retained my services for the preparation of engineering and Architectural drawings for the property [location omitted](&ldquo;Machockie&rdquo;)</P>
<P>3. In the same Year, I met Aftab Chaudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rsquo;) for the first time when he along with Sarfraz visited my office. He introduced himself as a partner of Sarfraz Warraich in the Machockie Property. Both of them informed me that they are equal partner in the Machockie Property although the title of the said property was on the name of Aftab and his wife.</P>
<P>4. In the Year-2015 we could not approve the minor Variance from the Committee of Adjustment (COA) for Machockie Road, Toronto.</P>
<P>5. Making a second attempt, I applied for a minor variance once again on their behalf. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in obtaining an approval from the Committee of Adjustment (COA). Sarfraz paid me $20,000 towards the expenses of drawings, Survey and City of Toronto fee.</P>
<P>6. Later, I applied to the Ontario Municipal Board (MOB), and both Sarfraz and Aftab attended the OMB hearing. We finally obtained approval from OMB.</P>
<P>7. In the Year 2016 Sarfraz visited me and asked me to stop work on the issuance of building permit for the Machockie property. I asked Sarfraz the reason, and he informed that Aftab had promised him to pay for his share of ownership, however, is delaying the payment for his share.</P>
<P>8. I knew that Sarfraz and Aftab were friends. I offered to mediate between the two. Sarfraz agreed, and I called Aftab the next day, who said that he will come to my office the next day.</P>
<P>9. The next day, September 02, 2018, both visited my office. After discussion and Agreement, I wrote the Agreement reached by both partners on a plain paper in the presence of both the partners (Aftab &amp; Sarfraz). The terms of the Agreement were as follows;
<P1>(a) Aftab will pay Sarfraz a sum of $204,500 for Sarfraz's share of ownership;</P1>
<P1>(b) Aftab will grant a mortgage in the sum of $184,500 at 3.5% to Sarfraz secured Against [location omitted]</P1>
<P1>(c) Sarfraz will move out of the property after the registration of mortgage against the Machockie property in the sum of $184,500 for one year;</P1>
<P1>(d) Aftab will pay a deposit of $20,000.00 (less the three-month rent/carrying cost of the property);</P1>
<P1>(e) Both parties signed the Agreement in my presence voluntarily. Aftab gave a cheque of $12,880.00 (20,000- Less three month of house rent/expense that Sarfraz had not paid).</P1></P>
<P>10. Later, I cam to know from Sarfraz that Aftab refused to register the mortgage on the Machockie property. I spoke with Aftab in regard to the registration of loan/mortgage against the property. Aftab told me that he needs to obtain secured Line of Credit (LOC) against the property ([location omitted] and after obtaining the Line of Credit, he will register the loan of Sarfraz against the said property.</P>
<P>11. When informed Sarfraz about the secured Line of Credit against the property that Aftab intended to obtain, Sarfraz replied that this was not a term of the Agreement that was reached between him and Aftab. He further said that there will be &ldquo;No more Equity&rdquo; left in the said property, so he didn't see his security that is return of loan by Aftab.</P>
<P>12. Soon thereafter, litigation ensured.</P>
<P>I make these affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<P>I, Shahid Awan, of the City of Markham, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I have known Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) since 2010. Sarfraz renovates residential properties. I have invested and worked with Sarfraz in several renovation projects. I have also known Aftab Chaudhry since 2011 as such I have personal knowledge of the matters herein deposed;</P>
<P>2. Sarfraz introduced me to Aftab in 2011 when we were renovating [location omitted] Aftab worked as an electrician on the that property. Both Sarfraz and Aftab were friends and had family relations.</P>
<P>3. On several occasions, Sarfraz invited me and my family to his house. On those occasions, Aftab along with family also attended.</P>
<P>4. In 2011, I, along with Sarfraz and Chaudhry Waheed Akhtar (&ldquo;Waheed&rdquo;) purchased [location omitted] (O'Conner) The Property was under my name. However, based on a verbal agreement, Waheed and Sarfraz were partners with me. I had 50% ownership of the property and Waheed and Sarfraz each had 25% share in the O' Connor Property.</P>
<P>5. We had applied for a permit to demolish and renovate the O' Connor property. Therefore, in April of 2012, Sarfraz moved from [location omitted] and moved into [location omitted]</P>
<P>6. In August 2012, Sarfraz asked me to make a cheque payable to Aftab. ON August 13, 2012, I made a cheque in the sum of $10,000.00 and paid Aftab. This money was not on account of any money that I or any of my partners owed to Aftab at that time. Aftab cashed that cheque.</P>
<P>7. Following renovation, we sold [location omitted] in 2013. In April 2013, Sarfraz asked me to make a cheque payable to Aftab Chaudhry in the sum of $37,000 from the share of Sarfraz in the profits of [location omitted] I made a cheque for the said sum to Aftab Chaudhry dated April 16, 2013. The cheque was cashed by Aftab.</P>
<P>8. In partnership with Waheed and Sarfraz, we renovated and sold 42 St. Hubert in 2014. I had 50% ownership and each of Sarfraz and Waheed had 25% of ownership. Based on verbal agreement. Following the sale, we distributed the share of profit in accordance with the verbal agreement.</P>
<P>9. In September 2012, we purchased [location omitted] (&ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo;). That property was purchased under the name of Mr. Omar Mian. I, Sarfraz and Omar Mian were the three partners having equal share in the property based on a verbal agreement.</P>
<P>10. Later on, I came to know that Sarfraz had given a part of his share to Aftab in [location omitted]</P>
<P>11. Sometime in 2014, I met Ashfaq Chaudhry (&ldquo;Ashfaq&rdquo;). He became a good fried and acted as my real estate agent when I purchased my home in Markham in 2016.</P>
<P>12. In 2016, I was shocked to learn that there was some dispute between Aftab and Sarfraz concerning [location omitted]as I had known for years that they were close friends.</P>
<P>13. When I asked Sarfraz abut the dispute, he informed me about the dispute and sent me a copy of the written agreement dated September 02, 2016 between Sarfraz and Aftab.</P>
<P>14. I showed a copy of the written agreement to Ashfaq Chaudhry, the brother of Aftab as I wanted to resolve the dispute between the friends. I negotiated between the parties several times. During these negotiations, I was informed by Ashfaq that Aftab intended to pay the money as noted in the Agreement of September 02, 2016, in the sum of $204,000.00 to Sarfraz. When I asked for confirmation in writing specifying a time line, Ashfaq refused to provide any.</P>
<P>15. During these negotiations I along with others met Ashfaq a few time. Although they admitted that Aftab intends to pay the money, he did not want to provide any further confirmation in writing or stick to a time line.</P>
<P>16. I have worked with Sarfraz for many years, I never had any dispute with him in accounting or in the distribution of his share despite the fact, that most of the agreements between us were verbal.</P>
<P>I make these affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<P>I, Chaudhry Waheed Akhtar, (&ldquo;Waheed&rdquo;) of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I have known Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) since 2000. Sarfraz renovates residential properties. I have invested and worked with Sarfraz in several renovation projects since 2009. I have also known Aftab Chaudhry since 2009 and as such I have personal knowledge of the matters herein deposed;</P>
<P>2. Sarfraz introduced me to Aftab in 2009 when we were renovating [location omitted] That property was in my name, however, Sarfraz was 50% owner in that property based on a verbal agreement. Later we sold that property and distributed our share in accordance with the verbal agreement.</P>
<P>3. After 2009, we all became good friends with Aftab and we used to attend family functions at each other's houses.</P>
<P>4. In 2011, I, in partnership with Sarfraz and Shahid Awan (&ldquo;Shahid&rdquo;) purchased and renovated [location omitted] The Property was under the name of Shahid. However, based on a verbal agreement, I and Sarfraz were partners in that property. Shahid Awan had 50% ownership of the property and I and Sarfraz each had 25% share in the O' Connor Property. Aftab worked as an electrician for us on the that property.</P>
<P>5. In April 2012, Sarfraz moved from [location omitted] (St. &ldquo;Hubert&rdquo;) to [location omitted] (&ldquo;Machockie&rdquo;). Sarfaz informed me that Aftab had offered him 50% share in the Machockie Property in exchange for 50% of acquisition costs and 50% of carrying costs of the Property. He also said that he along with Aftab will renovate the property for sale.</P>
<P>6. As we used to buy, renovate and sell properties based on verbal agreements, I did not see anything unusual in this arrangement.</P>
<P>7. I know that in August 2012, at the request of Sarfraz, Shahid Awan paid the sum of $10,000.00, to Aftab. This money was not on account of any outstanding invoice of Aftab and it was given on the instructions of Sarfraz.</P>
<P>8. In April 2013, we sold [location omitted] On April 2013, at Sarfraz' direction a cheque in the sum of $37,000 was paid to Aftab. This money came from the share of profit of Sarfraz from the O'Connor property.</P>
<P>9. Sarfraz used to discuss with me the plans/design for the Machockie Property. I am aware that obtaining of the permit took a long time. Finally, after going through OMB, they were able to obtain the permit for renovation.</P>
<P>10. In March 2016, Aftab told me that he wanted to buy the share of Sarfraz as he wanted to build the Machockie property for himself. To my knowledge, Sarfraz and Aftab had meetings to discuss the current market price and the respective ownership share of both the partners.</P>
<P>11. However, both the partners could not agree on the current market value of the Machockie Property. Both Aftab and Sarfraz informed me of their disagreement. At this point, despite the disagreement on the value of the property, they still were good friends.</P>
<P>12. I discussed the issue individually with Sarfraz and Aftab to narrow down the difference between the friends and partners. This process took approximately 15 days. Finally, in or around May 2016, I told Aftab that I will come to his house to settle this matter.</P>
<P>13. Aftab agreed to discuss the matter and I went to his home in Richmond Hill, [location omitted] We met in the evening in the basement of his home. Sarfraz and Aftab had already discussed the property values.</P>
<P>14. Following discussions, Aftab agreed to pay the sum of 204,500.00 to a Sarfraz. Aftab told me that he will immediately refinance the property and pay Sarfraz the full sum of $204,500.00</P>
<P>15. After leaving Aftab's house, I called Sarfraz and he agreed to settle the matter for the sum of $204,500.00 After talking to Sarfraz, I called Aftab back and informed him that Sarfraz has agreed and that we have an agreement.</P>
<P>16. The refinancing did not happen and a further disagreement arose between Sarfraz and Aftab. However, on September 02, 2016, both Aftab and Sarfraz met at the office of Leo and entered into a written agreement. Both Aftab and Sarfraz called me and informed me that they have settled their differences. Aftab told me on the phone that he was willing to give a mortgage to Sarfraz for the sum of $204,500.00</P>
<P>17. Later on, Aftab took the position that he will first refinance the property and then register the mortgage to Sarfraz on the propriety. On his part, Sarfraz was unhappy as this was not the term of the verbal or the written agreement and further that after the refinancing, no equity would have been left in the Property.</P>
<P>18. When the differences could not be bridged, Sarfraz commenced an Action in the Superior Court and Aftab not only defended but brought two applications in the Landlord and Tenant Board.</P>
<P>19. Despite the commencement of the litigation I and Shahid Awan made one last effort to settle the differences. Shahid Awan met the brother of Aftab, Mr. Ashfaq Chaudhry, however, we could not reach an Agreement.</P>
<P>20. During all the negotiations between me and Aftab, not even a single time, did Aftab ever deny that Sarfraz was a 50% owner in the Machockie, Road Property.</P>
<P>I make these affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF SARFRAZ WARRAICH (Sworn June 27, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>Sarfraz Warraich</BOLD> of the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario make oath and say as follows.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>1. I am in the business of renovation of residential properties. I and the Defendant Aftab Chaudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rdquo;) had been friends for many years and we had family relations. We both originally belong to the same town of Gujarat in Pakistan.</P>
<P>2. As a result, I developed a relationship of trust with Aftab. As an electrician, Aftab also provided services for several properties owned by me or my associates.</P>
<P>3. In March 2012, Aftab and is wife Nuzhat Yasmine (&ldquo;Nuzhat&rdquo;) purchased [location omitted] (the &ldquo; Property &rdquo;). At the relevant time, they had sold their home, [location omitted] (&ldquo;Sequine&rdquo;). Aftab obtained bridge financing for the purchase of the property.</P>
<P>4. The Sale of the Richmond Hill property fell and Aftab, who is an electrician by profession, had to bear the burden of carrying two properties. Aftab still resides at that property.</P>
<P>5. In March 2012, Aftab, approached me and offered me 50% ownership of the Property in exchange for 50% of the Acquisition costs and 50% of the carrying cost of the property.</P>
<P>6. I accepted the offer and we made a verbal agreement pursuant to which, in exchange for 50% acquisition costs, and 50% of the carrying costs, Aftab and Nuzhat held 50% of the tide in trust for me. I along with my wife moved into the Property in April 2012, without any Residential Tenancy Agreement as were the beneficial owners. We agreed that I will pay my half of the acquisitions costs following the sale of another property that was under renovation.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; are copies of the proof of living of the Plaintiff on the property since 2012.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>PROOF OF MONIES I PAID TO THE DEFENDANT</TI>
<P>7. Following the Agreement, In or about April 2012 I moved into the Property, with my wife and the children. We have lived in the property as beneficial owners and have made contributions to one half of the costs of the property.</P>
<P>8. I have paid 50% of the expenses from April 2012 to date. By April 2013, I paid Aftab $62,000.00 as one half of the acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; are copies of the cheques where I paid Aftab $62,000.00</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST AND PARTNERSHIP IN WATERLOO PROPERTY</TI>
<P>9. Based on a verbal agreement, Aftab was a partner with me in the Waterloo Property.</P>
<P>10. Following completion of renovation and sale of the Waterloo Property, Aftab provided me an accounting of his investments and costs and I faithfully fulfilled my obligations and made payment to Aftab in the sum of $30,000.00 that included his investments as well as profits.</P>
<P>11. As set out above, we did not have any written contract with respect to our business transactions. Aftab was dependent on my good faith performance of my obligations with respect to the Waterloo Property. I fulfilled my promises in good faith and made payments to him as agreed in respect of</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; the copies of the cheque of payment to the Defendant for Waterloo, Property.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT OBTAINED BY AFTAB ON FRAUD</TI>
<P>12. As stated above, I along with my family have lived in the Property since April 2012. In or around, 2014, the Defendant, Choudhry made fraudulent misrepresentation to me that he requires a Residential Tenancy Agreement only for &ldquo;tax filing purposes&rdquo; as wanted to claim rental income.</P>
<P>13. I sought the advice of my accountant, Ashfaq Chaudhry (&ldquo;Ashfaq&rdquo;) at the time, (who is also the brother of the Defendant). My accountant, Mr. Ishfaq Chaudhry advised me that there is no harm in signing the Residential Tenancy Agreement as it is only for tax purposes.</P>
<P>14. Relying on the advice of the accountant, and trusting the Defendant, I signed the tenancy agreement in 2014. The Defendant later fraudulently changed the date to March 2013. The Defendant has sole reliance on an Agreement that has been obtained on Fraud and the testimony of his brother.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; is the copy of Lease Agreement</BOLD></P>
<P>15. The Residential Tenancy Agreement, which he obtained on fraud is the sole evidence by which Aftab want to deny my rights including the payment of $62,000.00 and Sworn testimony of 4 witness excluding me. Apart from his brother, Aftab does not have a single witness to support his fraudulent position.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>BREAKDOWN OF RELATIONSHIP</TI>
<P>In March 2016, having obtained the minor variance from OMB, Aftab asked me if he could purchase my share. As we were friends, I agreed. In the summer of 2016, I and Aftab negotiated to separate our mutual ownership interests in the Property. After several rounds of negotiations, we could not agree on the valuation of the Property. Due to the obstructionist conduct of the Defendant, in or around August 2016, I stopped payment of the shared expenses, respecting he costs of the property, for two months.</P>
<P>16. One of our mutual friend Chaudhry Waheed Akhtar went to Aftab's home around May 2016, and finalized the figure of $204,500.00 that was payable by Aftab to me for my share of the Property. Aftab promised that he will pay this share following the refinancing of the Mac hockie Property, However, Aftab delayed the refinancing of the Property and I began to doubt his intentions.</P>
<P>17. Finally, Aftab and I reached a written Agreement on September 02, 2016 in the presence of Leo Mast randrea (&ldquo;Leo&rdquo;) that was signed by both Aftab and myself in the presence of Leo.</P>
<P>18. According to the written agreement dated September 2, 2016, after taking into account the current market value of the Property less the outstanding mortgage, Aftab agreed that $204,500.00 my share in the Property. Taking into account the adjustments between us for all expenses related to the Property, Aftab agreed to grant me a mortgage in the sum of $184, 500.00 that was to be secured against the Property.</P>
<P>19. For faithful performance of this agreement, I demanded a deposit of $20,000.00. After deducting 50% of the Property expenses for three months, the Defendants, provided me a cheque for $12,800.00 as deposit for the written agreement dated September 2, 2016.</P>
<P>20. The defendants clearly admitted my beneficial ownership in the property and agreed to grant me a mortgage in the sum of $184,000.00.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the Written Agreement and the Cheque provided by the Defendants.</BOLD></P>
<P>21. Relying on the written Agreement, I instructed my lawyer to send mortgage documents to the lawyer for the Defendants for the grant of the mortgage and execution of the documents by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Choudhry for the agreed amount due to me by the defendants.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; is the mortgage documents sent to the lawyer for the Defendants.</BOLD></P>
<P>22. Later, Aftab reneged on the written Agreement as well. Aftab informed me and Leo that will first refinance the property and then sign the mortgage documents. This was not a term of the Agreement that Waheed had negotiated with Aftab to which I had agreed. It was also not a term of the written agreement that was entered into by both of us in Leo's office on September 02, 2016.</P>
<P>23. I also knew that after the refinance, there would be no equity left in the Property which would have seriously prejudiced my interest. Following the refusal of the Defendant to sign the mortgage documents, my lawyer once again sent the letter to the Lawyer of the Defendants asking them to fulfill their promise, but to no avail.</P>
<P>24. In view of the untrustworthy conduct of the Defendants, I registered a caution on the title of the property and also issued a Statement of Claim.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; is the Notice of Caution registered on land</BOLD></P>
<P>25. On Nov 1, 2016, I commenced this Action against the defendants and served it on the defendants.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; is the Statement of Claim.</BOLD></P>
<P>26. On Nov 7, 2016, the defendants served me with their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>MOTION OF AFTAB IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE</TI>
<P>27. Aftab brought a motion in the Superior court for an injunction which among other things, requested occupation rent.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is the Notice of Motion by the Defendant</BOLD></P>
<P>28. Justice Matheson, in her endorsement ordered that I pay $2,000.00 per month until the matter is deal with on the merits. Justice Matheson noted there will be proper account of the sums and that these payments are without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is in compliance with the order of Justice Matheson.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; is the endorsement of Madam Justice Matheson</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>CONCURRENT LITIGATION COMMENCED BY THE DEFENDANTS IN THE LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD, (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;);</TI>
<P>27-A. Despite having obtained the relief they had sought, and while the matter was pending before the Superior Court, the Defendants commenced two Applications before the Landlord and Tenant Board. One application was for eviction on the basis of non-payment of rent and the other one was based on the Demolition of the Property. The Defendant's lawyer submitted to the Board that these applications were &ldquo; a fail-safe measure&rdquo;).</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;K-1&rdquo; are the transcripts of the hearing of the LTB Member</BOLD></P>
<P>29. I was unable to attend the LTB hearing as I had a doctor's appointment that day and lawyer was out of the country at the time. Aftab, misled the Member in his sworn statement before LTB and claimed that I had been living at the property since September 2013, as we written in the Fraudulent Lease Agreement. He never informed the Member that I was living at the Property since April 2012 or that I had paid him $62,000.00 as my half of the acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo; is the copy of doctor's office slip.</BOLD></P>
<P>30. The Member LTB Member, without hearing any evidence from me or my counsel prejudged me and citing prejudice to the Landlord, (as noted in the transcripts) refused to grant an adjournment to the agent who attended my behalf and ordered my eviction, solely on the Residential Tenancy Agreement and the uncontested evidence of Aftab</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo; is the order of the LTB on the L-1 Application</BOLD></P>
<P>31. Despite the protest of the Plaintiff, the same LTB Member continued to hear the Demolition Application and reached the same result.</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo; is the order of the LTB on the L-2 Application</BOLD></P>
<P>32. I appealed both the orders of the LTB Member to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court dismissed my Appeal on the technical grounds that an appeal can only succeed on a question of law only. However, at Paragraph 21 affirmed my right to apply to this court for Stay of the eviction, for which I have commenced this Motion.</P>
<P>33. The Divisional Court reaffirmed that the LTB does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicated on the equitable rights and held that this was a Novel Issue that had not been litigated before.</P>
<P>The Divisional Court also held at paragraph 15 that &ldquo;..Conversely, the Superior Court has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim of an equitable ownership interest in the property.&rdquo;</P>
<P><BOLD>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo; is the Decision of Divisional Court</BOLD></P>
<P>34. For the record, as beneficial owner of the property, I, along with my family have living at the property since April 2012 prior to the dubious Tenancy agreement dated March 2013;</P>
<P>35. I have paid my own half of the acquisition costs. I have provided proof of the payments that Aftab admits he has received. I have meritorious Claim and my substantive rights are at issue and the proper court to determine those issues is the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>36. I have strong and meritorious case and my position is supported by three arm's length witnesses who not have personal knowledge were part of the negotiations between myself and Aftab. On the other hand, Aftab is relying on a residential tenancy agreement that was obtained on fraud and he is relying on the support of real brother to helped him in perpetrating that fraud. I relied on his brother because he was my accountant</P>
<P>37. If the injunction is not granted I will be deprived of my rights against which I will have no recourse and I will suffer irreparable harm. It is the stated intention of Aftab to demolish the property and I will have no say in the costs of the demolition or renovation and any expenses that may be added by Aftab. In short, while my rights have not been yet being determined, Aftab will deal with the Property with unfettered discretion as an owner.</P>
<P>38. I and my family will be dislocated and disposed of my rights when those are pending determination before the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>39. If this Honourable Court grants an injunction prohibiting my eviction, I hereby undertake to Indemnify the Defendants against any losses resulting from the grant of this injunction.</P>
<P>40. The Action has been sent down for trial and I should not be deprived of my rights without a determination of my rights by a judge of the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>I make this affidavit in support of my position on this motion and in rebuttal of the relief the defendants have requested and for no improper purpose.</P>
<P>I make this affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF MALLORY SMITH</TI>
<P>I, Mallory Smith, of the City of Toronto, make oath and say as follows:</P>
<P>1. I am a law clerk and am employed by Arnold Zweig, the lawyer for the Defendants.</P>
<P>2. I wish to address the allegation that the plaintiff has set this matter down for trial and the allegation that he is waiting for a trial date.</P>
<P>3. That is not a proper statement of what has actually transpired.</P>
<P>4. It is true that a Trial Record was served by the plaintiff upon our office. That Record was received by us on or about January 15, 2018.</P>
<P>5. I read the affidavit of the Plaintiff for this motion, and in paragraph 40 he states that he did in fact set this matter down for trial.</P>
<P>6. I am familiar with the procedures in the Trial Office in Toronto. I am aware that after a few months of filing the Trial Record, the plaintiff's lawyer receives a certification form to be completed with opposing counsel for the purposes of setting a pretrial and a trial date. I have been advised by the Trial office, that if all parties are represented by counsel, they only send the certification form to the plaintiff's counsel.</P>
<P>7. Without the completion of that form, the Trial office will not set a date for the trial of this action.</P>
<P>8. As our office had not received word regarding this certification form since the receipt of the Trial Record, I was instructed by Mr. Zweig to attend the Trial office to see if I could find out what was the cause of the delay.</P>
<P>9. I attended the Trial office on June 27, 2018 and I spoke to Theodora Apostolopoulos.</P>
<P>10. I was advised that the standard certification form was actually sent to Mr. Syed on March 14, 2018 by fax. The fax number they used is was the fax number that appeared on the back page of Mr. Syed's trial record.</P>
<P>11. I was given a copy of the certification form by the Trial office and I attach that as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit.</P>
<P>12. I can advise this Court that I deal with all of the paperwork in the office and at no time did I receive any request from Mr. Syed in respect to this form. At no time did Mr. Syed ask for availability for trial, and at no time did he ask our office to help complete the form in respect of the number of witnesses or documents and so on that the form requires.</P>
<P>13. I advised Mr. Zweig of what I discovered and he instructed me to send an email to Mr. Syed advising him of my findings. He also asked me to demand that the form be completed without delay so that this matter can be assigned a trial date.</P>
<P>14. On June 27, 2018, I drafted and sent an email to Mr. Syed. I told him that I had been to the trial office and that they informed me that he had been sent the certification form over 3 months previous. As per the isntructions I received from Mr. Zweig, I requested that Mr. Syed complete the form and send it to our office by no later than June 29, 2018 for us to complete our sections of the form. I emphasized that the trial list was already booking long trials into June and September of 2019 and that the delay of three months had set us back in our ability to secure a trial date for this matter. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of my email to Mr. Syed.</P>
<P>15. I can advise this Court that at no time did I ever receive a response to my email.</P>

<P>I, Aftab Choudhry of the City of Toronto, make oath and say as follows:</P>
<P>1. I, along with my wife, are the defendants in this matter and as such I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to.</P>
<P>2. As has been set out in the affidavit of the plaintiff, the matter of my relationship with the plaintiff has been determined by the Landlord and Tenant Board (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) on two occasions and on both of those occasions Orders were made granting me possession of my property.</P>
<P>3. Both of those decisions were appealed to the Divisional Court and both of those decisions were upheld by that appeal court.</P>
<P>4. The matter of the lease that Mr. Warriach alleges to be a fraudulent document, was determined by the Board to be legal, valid and binding. The Divisional Court found that the decisions of the Landlord and Tenant Board were reasonable. I would think, then, that the issue of the validity of the lease has been determined and should be put to rest.</P>
<P>5. The determination made by the Board was not technical nor perfunctory. It was determined over the course of many months and Board Member Solomon heard from every witness that had knowledge of the matters surrounding my relationship with Mr. Warriach.</P>
<P>6. Member Solomon determined conclusively that I had a valid and binding landlord and tenant relationship and that Mr. Warriach failed to pay rent and was ordered to vacate the premises.</P>
<P>7. In the L2 decision, at paragraph 39, Member Solmon said:
<QUOTE><P>I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that 1) the Landlord and his wife are the only owners of the residential complex; and 2) the Tenant satisfies the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in the Act.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. The L2 decision has been enclosed in the Motion Record of the Plaintiff at Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo;.</P>
<P>9. Member Solomon based her decision on the facts she found after a full hearing, which is found at paragraph 40 of the L2 decision:
<QUOTE><P>The parties signed a Tenancy Agreement that defined their relationship as Landlord and Tenant. There is no objective evidence before me to suggest that the tenancy agreement was not intended to govern the relationship between the parties. Further, the text messages between the parties from 2016 as well as the agreement the parties signed on September 2, 2016 acknowledge the Tenant's obligation to pay rent. There is no convincing evidence before me to establish that the Tenant is an owner of the residential complex, which would exclude him from the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>10. As part of the Board's process, as provided for in Section 83 (1) of the <EM>Residential Tenancies Act</EM>, the Board was obligated to determine whether or not relief ought to be given from eviction.</P>
<P>11. The Board heard testimony that Mr. Warriach had built a home in the same neighbourhood and there was no reason that he and his family needed to stay at my property. At paragraph 7 of the L1 Decision, Member Solomon determined and found that:
<QUOTE><P>it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83 (1) of the Act.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a Geowarehouse Online Property Detail report for [location omitted] which states that the plaintiff is the owner of that property.</P>
<P>13. The L1 decision has been enclosed in the Motion Record of the Plaintiff at Tab &ldquo;M&rdquo;.</P>
<P>14. Not only was that matter determined in relation to the L1 Application, but Mr. Warriach admitted to the Board that he was prepared to move out of my property. On page 8, paragraph 42 of the L2 decision Member Solomon wrote:
<QUOTE><P>when the Tenant was asked if there were any circumstances he wished to disclose in support of delaying or denying eviction, he responded that he was prepared to move out of the residential complete immediately if the Landlord paid him half of the value of the house. .... I see no reason to further delay the eviction. Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 (2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83 (1) of the Act..</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>15. In effect, then, the Board dealt with the test for a stay of the eviction order. The Board determined that there would be no hardship for Mr. Warriach and that the delay in the eviction was only prejudicing me.</P>
<P>16. Mr. Warriach's claim is that of an equity interest in the property which I have said, I deny.</P>
<P>17. However, my plans with respect to the property would not in any way prejudice Mr. Warriach in the claim that he is making if he is indeed successful.</P>
<P>18. My plan is to demolish and renovate the home presently on the property and greatly increase its value. I have no plans on selling and taking off with the sale proceeds.</P>
<P>19. I have figured that I would need an additional $41,463.00 ($170x 2439 per squre foot) in financing to do the renovation and estimate that the total value of the property would approximate $1,700,000.00. Having regard to the financing that would be on title, there would remain the amount of $900,000.00 in equity.</P>
<P>20. So, in the event that Mr. Warriach is successful in this action, then there will be sufficient equity in the property over which he can obtain his equitable interest and therefore there is no prejudice to him if I was to carry out my intended plan. That plan, by the way, has been on hold for almost two years because of the litigation that Mr. Warriach has instituted against me.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) has brought this motion for stopping the eviction by the Sheriff pursuant to the orders of the Landlrod Tenant (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) when the Action for determinaion of the substantive rights of the parties is pending adjudicatioin before die Superior Court of Justice. In addition, the Action has already been set-down for trail. The Plaintiff seeks leave of this Court for;</P>
<P>(a) An order prohibiting the defendants to enforce the order of the Landlord and Tenant Board dated December 4, 2017 to dislodge the plaintiffs' family from the Property while this matter for the determination of the rights of parties on the merit is pending determination before the Superior Court of Justice ;</P>
<P>(b) The unjustified eviction would constitute immediate distress to the plaintiffs and their children. It would also permanently deprive them of their rights and their home which far outweighed the inconvenience of to the Defendants to wait for a determination of the rights on merit by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>(c) Because the eviction and demolition of the Property would seriously prejudice the rights of the plaintiff, the Plaintiff seeks the immediate remedy of an injunction, granting a stay of the eviction. If the immediate remedy is not granted, the demolition of the house, for which the Defendant has an order from the LTB, and which has been the stated intention of the Defendants,will impair the rigts of the Plaintiff such that by the time of a final determination it would be impossible to fashion a proper remedy.</P>
<P>(d) Finally, the Defendant's conduct has been unduly litigious as having previously agreed to withhold enforcement pending the hearing of this Motion. Now the Defendant has refused to agree to a reasonable request for rescheduling the hearing of the Motion and seeks an eviction which will prejudice the rights of the Plaintiff to put the matter properly before the court so that a determination on merit can be done.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW (The Plaintiff and Defendants dispute the ownership of the Property, [location omitted]</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff, Sarfraz and Defendant Aftab Chaudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rdquo;) who were freind of many years, now dispute the owenrship of [location omitted]</P>
<P>2. The Defendant, Aftab, has obtained an order from the Landlord Tenant Borad (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) and wants to demolish the Property. The Plaintiff, continues to pay the Defendant a sum of $2000.00 that was orderd by Justice Matheson of the Superior Court of Justice in January 2017 and wants to preserve the status quo until the Superior Court of Justice deteermines his rights based on the merits of the case.</P>
<P>3. Sarfraz seeks an order to stop his eviction from the Property pursunat to the order of the Landlord Tenant Board and wanat the Court for an order prohibiting the Defendants to demoish the Property.</P>
<P>4. It is the position of Sarfraz that due to eviction and demolition of the Property, he and his family will suffer an irreprable harm and that the balance of conveniece favours mainting the status quo, until the Superior Court makes a determination of the substantive rights of the paraties.</P>
<P>5. Sarfraz states that his claim in the Superior Court is based on his equitable rights in the ownership of the Property that can only be adjudicated by the Superior Court of Justice. Although the Divisional Court dismissed his Appeal from the order of the LTB Member, the Divisional Court held that the equitable rights of litigants in the real property can only be decided by the Superior Court.</P>
<P>6. Sarfraz claims that his claim is not frivolous, and it raises a serious issue. Sarfraz states that if in fact, following a trial, the Superior court Justice determines that Sarfraz has 50 % ownership of the Property, there will be no house left, as the Defendants intend to demolish the Property.</P>
<P>7. Stopping the eviction, and preservation of the property from demolition, therefor, is of utmost importance to the Plaintiff and his family and for the preservation of their substantive rights. It will be near impossible to determine what and how much money was spent by the Defendant on the Demolition or the renovation of the subject property.</P>
<P>8. Dislodgment of the plaintiffs' family while this matter is being litigated would constitute immediate distress to the plaintiff, his wife and their children which far outweighs the defendant's inconvenience to wait for the determination of the issue on merits.</P>
<P>9. Sarfraz says the should a Judge of the Superior Court of Justice makes a determination on the merits that he is not the 50% owenr of the Property, Aftab will not be in a worse position and will take his entitlement following the decision. On the other hand, if he is evicted and the Propery is demolished, his rights will be lost for ever and it will be almost impossible for him to enforce his rights when the subject matter of the dipute the Property is demolished.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III-SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>10. On November 1, 2016, the Plaintiff issued a Statement of Claim;
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Sarfraz Warraich, sworn May 25, 2018 (the &ldquo;Sarfraz Affidavit&rdquo;), at Tab-1 at paras. 24</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. On November 7, 2016, the Defendnats issued a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 25</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. On December 7, 2016, on the first hearing of the L-1 Application based on the non-payment of rent, the Member orderd an eviction. The Plaintiff could not attend due to a Doctor's appintment and the Counel of the Plaintiff was out of the country.</P>
<P>13. The Defendant relied on the faudulent residential tenancy agreement and misinformed the Member that Sarfraz has lived at the Property since September 2013. The Defendnat did not advise the Member that Sarfraz has been living at the property since April 2012, or that I had paid him $62,000.00 as my half of the acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>CONCURRENT LITIGATION BY THE DEFENDANT IN SUPERIOR COURT</TI>
<P>14. Through a motion in the Suprior Court of Justice, Aftab requested the same relief of termination of the tenancy, vacant possession or occupancy costs until trial from the Suprior Court of Justice;</P>
<P>15. On January 30th, 2016, Justice Matheson heard the motion of the Defendants and ordered that the plaintiff pay the sum of $2000.00 pending adjudiction of the Action on merits. Justice Matheson noted that this sum will be accounted for and it is wihtout prejudice to the rights of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>16. The Plaintiff is in compliance with the order of the Justice Matheson.
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 27-A</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Despite the offer of the Plaintiff to pursue the matter in the Superior Court only, the Defendants insisted on pursuing the matter before two forums and continued with the L-2 Application before the same Member of the LTB.</P>
<P>18. Despite the protest of the Plaintiff, to recuse herself the same Member continued to hear the 2nd Application stated she had assumed jurisdiction.
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at paras.30</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. The Member, on December 4, 2017, once again passed an eviction order permitting the Defendants to demolish the Property
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at para 30.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The Divisional Court dismissed the Appeal of the Plaintiff on the ground that the Appellant can only succed on a standard of correctness. However at pargraph 42, the Divisional Court held &ldquo;
<QUOTE><P>[42] <BOLD>The Board's decision was therefore reasonable even if it erred in also taking into account indicia of equitable ownership in reaching its decision that the Appellant was not a co-owner.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>

<P>21. The divisional Court also held that the Landlord Tenant Board did not have jurisdiction to determin the equitable ownership.
<QUOTE><P>[57] Since the Board has no jurisdiction to determine equitable ownership rights and entitlements, the Appellant will not be prejudiced by the Board's decision in the litigation of those issues in the Superior Court, as the Board's findings on the issue of co-ownership are not binding on the Superior Court. They involve different issues and the findings were made solely for the purpose of determining that the Appellant was a tenant within the meaning of the Act. The Board made no determination of the issue of co-ownership <EM>per se</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Warraich v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC1267</CITE><PARANUM>57</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>: Exhibit &ldquo;O&rsquo;</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV-STATEMENT OF ISSUES</TI>
<P>22. The following are the issues on this Motion;
<P1>a. Is there a serious issue to be tried?</P1>
<P1>b. Whether the Plaintiff will suffer in Irreparable Harm?</P1>
<P1>c. Where doe the balance of convenience lies?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART IV&mdash;THE LAW</TI>
<P>23. Rule 40.01 provides that an injunction may be obtained on a motion to a judge;
<QUOTE><SEC><N>40.01</N><SECP>An interlocutory injunction or mandatory order under section 101 or 102 of the Courts of Justice Act may be obtained on motion to a judge by a party to a pending or intended proceeding</SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Test</TI>
<P>Pursuant to Rule 40.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, a court may grant an interlocutory injunction on such terms as are considered just. This requires the application of a three-part test first formulated by the House of Lords in <CASEREF><SOC>American Cynamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>American Cynamid</EM>&rdquo;) and adopted in Canada by the Supreme Court of Canada (&ldquo;SCC&rdquo;) in <CASEREF><SOC>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (AG)</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>&rdquo;).<SUP>11</SUP> The plaintiff bears the burden of proof at each stage.</P>
<P>24. <UNDER>Strength of the Plaintiff's Case</UNDER>
<QUOTE><P>The plaintiff must show a &ldquo;serious question [of fact or law] to be tried.&rdquo; Previously, plaintiffs had been required to show a &ldquo;strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case.&rdquo; The &ldquo;serious question to be tried&rdquo; standard is generally a low threshold. In <EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>, the SCC held that:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The threshold is a low one.</BOLD> The judge on the application must make a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case... Once satisfied that the application is neither vexatious nor frivolous, the motions judge should proceed to consider that the plaintiff is unlikely to succeed at trial. A prolonged examination of the merits is neither necessary nor desirable.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>There might be cases and contexts where plaintiff will be required to meet a higher threshold more akin to the &ldquo;strong <EM>prima fade</EM> case&rdquo; requirement such as :
<ITEM><P>Picketing</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Defamation</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Restrictive (negative) covenants</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Fiduciary duties and misuse of confidential information</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Take-over bids</P></ITEM></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. Sarfraz has provided uncontrovertible evidence of payment of $62,000.00 which is more than the 50 % acquisiton costs of the Property under dispute.</P>
<P>26. Aftab has admitted receiving $62,000.00 as asserted by Sarfraz. Aftab, however says that it was for some electrical work on some of the properties. The Defendants have not proudced any invoices or any bills that equal the sum of $62,000.00 Mere bald assertions by the Aftab and computer generated spreadsheeets are the only evidence that Aftab has asserted as evidence;</P>
<P>27. Three credible witnesses testified supporting the Plaintiff's positon in the 2nd application before the LTB. However, the Member ruled that she will only consider the testimony of the witness for the demolition application as her ex-parte decision regarding the non-payment of rent on the L-1 application was final.</P>
<P>28. The Plaintiff's account is consistent and credible and he was unfazed and unshaken during cross-examination.</P>
<P>29. Aftab has admitted during cross-examination that he has lied consistently on his tax returns. The credibility of the Defendant is a live issue, which lends to the credibility and strong prima facie case of the Plaintiff;</P>
<P>30. The Plaintiff has contributed one half of the expenses of the Property from April 2012 to August 2016. In addition, the Plaintiff is compliant with the order of the Justice Matheson of the Superior Court of Justice. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Jurewicz v Jurewicz</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7563</CITE></CASEREF> wherein at paragraph 45, the Court while granting the stay note that;
<QUOTE><P>[45] Having regard to these principles and all of the circumstances in evidence, I therefore find that Mr. Jurewicz has raised an issue for the proposed appeal that is neither vexatious nor frivolous. He has therefore met the threshold of establishing there is a serious issue to be determined on the appeal.</P></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Whether the Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Without an Injunction</UNDER></TI>
<P>31. The demolition of one's home is serious issue. The Plaintiff believes he is an owner of the Property. The family of the Plaintiff has lived in the Property for the past six years or so. If an injunction is not granted the Plaintiff will suffer an irreparable harm;
<QUOTE><P>The notion of irreparable harm both incorporates and substitutes for the traditional discretionary barrier to equitable remedies; namely, proof that common law equities are inadequate.</P>
<P><BOLD>Jeffrey Berryman, <EM>The Law of Equitable Remedies</EM>, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2013) at 30.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1>(a) If in fact, following a trial, if the Superior court Justice determines that Sarfraz has 50 % ownership of the Property, there will be no house left, as the Defendants intend to demolish the Property;</P1>
<P1>(b) The preservation of the property from demolition, therefor is of utmost importance to the Plaintiff and his family and for the preservation of their substantive rights.</P1>
<P1>(c) It will be impossible to determine what and how much money was spent by the Defendant on the Demolition of the renovation of the subject property;</P1>
<P1>(d) In <EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>, the SCC held that,
<QUOTE><P>&ldquo;Irreparable&rdquo; refers to the <EM>nature</EM> of the harm suffered rather than its magnitude. It is harm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or cannot be cured, usually because one party cannot collect damages from the other. [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>(e) The eviction, and demolition, before the adjudication of the Superior court will adversely impact on the reputation of the Plaintiff who is a respectable member of the community and is in the business of renovation. This will also harm his business with other members in his future business ventures.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>The Balance of Convenience</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. Sarfraz has shown that there is a serious issue to be tried and that, absent an injunction, he or she would suffer irreparable harm. Sarfraz pleads that impact of not granting an injunction will be sever on the Plaintiff as compared to the Defendant. While the Defendant lives in Richmond Hill in 4 Sequin Drive, the Plaintiff and his family consider the Property home and has lived there for the past 6 years.</P>
<P>33. The Defendant will not be prejudiced by awaiting adjudication by the Superior Court as the Action has been set-down for trial.</P>
<P>34. The Defendants and the Plaintiff have been partners since April 2012. The Plaintiff is in compliance with the orders of Justice Matheson and it is only right and just that the Plaintiff should not be deprived of his house, before adjudication of he Court when it will not cause any irreparable harm to the Defendant.</P>
<P>35. Sarfraz pleads that in the core test to be applied is irreparable harm and the balance of convenience. It is only where the irreparable harm and the balance of convenience fail to yield a clear answer that the relative strength of the parties' cases may be taken into account, and even then, only where one side of the case is clearly stronger.</P>
<P>36. Sarfraz pleads that since he will be dispossessed of his home and will suffer irreparable loss that justice and equity of the situation in issue warrant the grant of the injunction. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Greig v. Kritikopoulou</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 4594 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> wherein the court held at paragraph 20 that;
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>..To dislodge the plaintiffs' family while this matter is being litigated would constitute immediate distress to the plaintiffs and their children, which is far outweighed by the defendant's unlawful efforts to repossess, convert or transfer the property...</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>37. Sarfraz further relies on the Ontario Court of Appeal Decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Abuzour v. Heydary</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 249</CITE></CASEREF> wherein the Court held at paragraph 38 that:
<QUOTE><P>[38] In my view, the overall justice of this case requires the grant of a stay. Landmann, Wang, and Smith should not end up in a worse position than they would have been had they received proper notice of the first mo tion. Accordingly, the October 28 order of Penny J. is stayed pending appeal of the January 29 order...)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. Sarfraz says that should a Judge of the Superior Court of Justice makes a determination on the merits that he is not the 50% owenr of the Property, Aftab will not be in a worse position and will take his entitlement following the decision.</P>
<P>39. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Jurewicz v Jurewicz</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7563</CITE></CASEREF> wherein at Paragraph 57, the Court observed that the balance of convenience narrowly favoured a the Moving party because the sale of the matrimonial home would have permanently impaired his rights.</P>
<P>40. Plaintiff's Undertaking</P>
<P>In Ontario, Rule 40.03 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> stipulates that:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>40.03</N><TI>Undertaking</TI>
<SECP>On a motion for an interlocutory injunction or mandatory order, the moving party shall, unless the court orders otherwise, undertake to abide by any order concerning damages that the court may make if it ultimately appears that the granting of the order has caused damage to the responding party for which the moving party ought to compensate the responding party.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>The plaintiff has provided the required undertaking in damages, which is &ldquo;meaningful.&rdquo; It is the Plaintiffs position that the Plaintiff has a compelling case and this Honourable Court has the discretion dispense with the Undertaking. As the Plaintiff has a compelling case. If the plaintiff is ultimately unsuccessful at trial, the defendant will be able to claim damages for the harm suffered as a result of the improperly obtained injunction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P><P1>1. The defendants deny that the plaintiff has established grounds for the stay of two orders for eviction both of which have been upheld by the Divisional Court. The defendants deny that there is any juristic basis upon which a stay can be granted, deny that there is any serious prejudice to the plaintiff and deny that the plaintiff can be entitled to possession of the property even if he is successful in his claim for a partial equitable interest in the property,</P1>
<P1>2. In addition, the defendants submit that the motion ought to be dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff has intentionally misled the Court in his submission that he has set this action down for trial.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<P><P1>3. The defendants own the property at [location omitted] and the plaintiff is a tenant at that property. It has been determined by the Landlord and Tenant Board (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) at two separate decisions from two separate hearings, December 14, 2016 and December 4, 2017 that the defendants are granted possession of their property and the tenant is to vacate the property.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tabs &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;N&rdquo;</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>4. Both of those decisions were appealed to the Divisional Court and both of those decisions were upheld by that appeal court.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;O&rdquo;</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>5. The matter of the lease that Mr. Warriach alleges to be a fraudulent document, was determined by the Board to be legal, valid and binding. The Divisional Court found that the decisions of the Landlord and Tenant Board were reasonable. The issue of the validity of the lease has been determined and is no longer an issue.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;O&rdquo;, paragraph 56 of the 732/17 Appeal</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>6. The determination made by the Board was not technical nor perfunctory. It was determined over the course of many months and Board Member Solomon heard from every witness that had knowledge of the matters surrounding the relationship as between Choudry and Warriach.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo;, page 1 of the decision</EM>.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>7. Member Solomon determined conclusively that there was a valid and binding landlord and tenant relationship and that Mr. Warriach failed to pay rent and was ordered to vacate the premises.
<QUOTE><P>I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that 1) the Landlord and his wife are the only owners of the residential complex; and 2) the Tenant satisfies the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in the Act.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo;, paragraph 39</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>8. Member Solomon based her decision on the facts she found after a full hearing,
<QUOTE><P>The parties signed a Tenancy Agreement that defined their relationship as Landlord and Tenant. There is no objective evidence before me to suggest that the tenancy agreement was not intended to govern the relationship between the parties. Further the text messages between the parties from 2016 as well as the agreement the parties signed on September 2, 2016 acknowledge the Tenant's obligation to pay rent. There is no convincing evidence before me to establish that the Tenant is an owner of the residential complex, which would exclude him from the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo; paragraph 40</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>9. As part of the Board's process, as provided for in Section 83 (1) of the <EM>Residential Tenancies Act</EM>, the Board was obligated to determine whether or not relief ought to be given from eviction.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo; paragraph 42</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>10. The Board heard testimony that Mr. Warriach had built a home in the same neighbourhood and there was no reason that he and his family needed to stay at my property and that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83 (1) of the Act. That home is at [location omitted]
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD>
<P3><BOLD><EM>Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;M&rdquo; paragraph 7</EM></BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD><EM>Responding Motion Record of the Defendants, Affidavit of Aftab Choudhry, paragraphs 11, 12 and Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</EM></BOLD></P3></P2></P1>
<P1>11. Mr. Warriach admitted to the Board that he was prepared to move out of property.
<QUOTE><P>when the Tenant was asked if there were any circumstances he wished to disclose in support of delaying or denying eviction, he responded that he was prepared to move out of the residential complete immediately if the Landlord paid him half of the value of the house. .... I see no reason to further delay the eviction. Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 (2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83 (1) of the Act..</P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Tab &ldquo;N&rdquo; page 8, paragraph 42</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>12. In effect, then, the Board dealt with the test for a stay of the eviction order. The Board determined that there would be no hardship for Mr. Warriach and that the delay in the eviction was only prejudicing the defendants.</P1>
<P1>13. Mr. Warriach's claim is that of an equity interest in the property and no claim for possession has been made in the Statement of Claim.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Motion Record, Statement of Claim, Tab &ldquo;H&rdquo;</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>14. However, Choudhry's plans with respect to the property would not in any way prejudice Mr. Warriach in the claim that he is making if he is indeed successful. His plan is to demolish and renovate the home presently on the property and greatly increase its value. He has no plans on selling and taking off with the sale proceeds.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Responding Motion Record, Choudhry aff. Paragraphs 17, 18</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>15. Choudhry estimated that he would need an additional $41,463.00 ($170x 2439 per square foot) in financing to do the renovation and estimates that the total value of the property would approximate $1,700,000.00. Having regard to the financing that would be on title, there would remain the amount of $900,000.00 in equity.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Responding Motion Record Choudhry aff. Paragraph 19</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>16. In the event that Mr. Warriach is successful in this action, there will be sufficient equity in the property over which he can obtain his equitable interest and therefore there is no prejudice to him if Choudry was to carry out his intended plan. That plan has been on hold for almost two years because of the litigation that Mr. Warriach has instituted.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Responding Motion Record, Choudhry aff. Paragraph 20</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>17. The plaintiff has asserted in his Factum Part 1(and at paragraph 33), that he has set down this action down for trial.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Plaintiff's Factum, page 3</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>18. That is not exactly accurate. The lawyer for Warriach did deliver the Trial Record on January 15, 2018 but has not taken any steps to obtain a pretrial date and a trial date. A certification form was sent by the Trial Office to Warriach's counsel on March 14, 2018.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Mallory Smith, Tab 2, paragraph 10</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>19. At no time did counsel for Warriach complete that certification form and seek input from Choudhry's counsel for its completion. The certification form remains uncompleted and was never sent to the Trial Office. Without doing so, the matter cannot be set down for a pretrial conference nor a trial. The matter therefore is in limbo.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Ref: Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Mallory Smith, Tab 2, paragraphs 11&ndash;13</EM></BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>20. When this was discovered, Mr. Warriach's counsel was asked to complete the form. That request was made on June 27, 2018. As of the date of the writing of this factum, no certification form has been received by Choudhry's counsel.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ARGUMENT AND THE LAW</TI>
<P><P1>21. The defendants accept the test as set forth in the plaintiff's factum but submit that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the test for a stay.</P1>
<P1>22. The defendants have denied that the plaintiff has an equitable interest in their property but any determination of that interest would not be affected if the Orders for eviction were to be carried out. There would still be sufficient equity in the property if the plaintiff was successful at trial in establishing an equitable interest.</P1>
<P1>23. No irreparable harm has been shown. The Board dealt with whether a stay ought to be granted to Warriach on the basis on section 83 of the Act and determined that a stay was not to be granted.</P1>
<P1>24. The evidence before the Court discloses that Warriach has other property and therefore alternative accommodation. There is nothing in the material that suggests that he and his family have &ldquo;nowhere to go&rdquo; and that his only alternative is to stay at the Machokie property.</P1>
<P1>25. Even if that were the case, there is no case law to support a finding that if an overholding tenant no longer has any right to stay in leased premises but has nowhere to move, that somehow that tenant is allowed to stay at the leased premises, regardless.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV-ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>26. The defendants submit that the motion be dismissed and in addition, that an Order be made that the plaintiff complete its certification form and submit that to the Trial Office within 10 days failing which its Claim be dismissed in its entirety with costs.</P1></P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I-NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) the Moving Party, seeks the following relief from this Hounurable Court;</P>
<P>(a) An order to Stay the order of the Landlord and Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) dated December 4, 2017 for demolition of the residential property, [location omitted](the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;) pending the determination of the Substantive rights of the parties by the Superior Court of Justice on the merits;</P>
<P>(b) A Stay of the orders of the Landlrod Tenant (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) dated December 2016 for eviction of the Plaintiff Sarfraz and his family from the Property pending a determination of the rights of parties on the merits by the Superior Court of Justice;</P>
<P>(c) The Defendants admits having received $62,000.00 from the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff claims were paid in 2013 as one half of acquisition costs of the Property while the Defendant says it was payment for electrical services.</P>
<P>(d) The Moving party relies on the Affidavit evidence of the Plaintiff and supporting sworn statements of three arm's length witnesses and documentary evidence.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) and the Defendant Aftab Chaudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rdquo;) were freinds for more than 15 years. They now dispute the owenrship of [location omitted](the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;);</P>
<P>2. Sarfraz Claims that since the Property has appreciated considerably in value since its acquisition in 2012, Aftab, in self-interest has claimed exclusive ownership based on a residential lease agreement that Aftab fraudulently induced him to sign.</P>
<P>3. Sarfraz states that he has paid $62,000.00 towards the acquisition costs of the Property in 2013 and has paid one half of the expenses since acquistion to date. Aftab admits receipt of $62,000.00 but says that this was payment for electrical services he performed for Sarfraz and the one half of the carrying costs paid by Sarfraz was merly rent.</P>
<P>4. In 2016, parties with the help of mutual friends reached a written agreement, on September 02, 2016. However, when Aftab refused to sign the mortgage documents pursuant to that agreement.</P>
<P>5. The Plaintiff issued a statement of Claim based on equitable ownership rights in the Superior Court.</P>
<P>6. Chaudhry defended the Claim in the Superior Court, brought a motion for relief in the Superior Court and simultanously brought two applications in the Landlord and Tenant Borad, one for eviction and one demolition of the Property.</P>
<P>7. The Landlord and Tenaant Board granted the application of Defendant for eviction where neither the Plaintiff nor his counsel was in attendance. The same LTB Member later granted an order for evictiction on the demolition application of the Defendant.</P>
<P>8. The Appeals of the Plaintiff were dismissed by the Divisional Court, however, the court noted that Plaitiff could obtain a stay of the order of the LTB Member from the Superior Court. The Divisional Court further held the equitable rights of the parties can only be determined by the Superior Court and that this was a novel case.</P>
<P>9. Sarfraz seeks an order to stop his eviction from the Property and the demolition of the Property pursunat to the order of the Landlord Tenant Board pending determination of his rights on the merits as he has a strong case on the merits and the he will suffer irrerprable harm if th relief is not granted and the balance of convenience favours the grant of the relief.</P>
<P>10. The Action has been set-down for trial.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III-SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>11. Following the failure of negotiation on the seperation of their respective interest, the Plaintiff issued a Statement of Claim based his equitable rights on November 1, 2016, the Plaintiff issued a Statement of Claim;</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Sarfraz Warraich, sworn June 27, 2018 (the &ldquo;Sarfraz Affidavit&rdquo;), at Tab-1 at paras. 25</BOLD></P>
<P>12. On November 7, 2016, the Defendnats issued a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. Aftab Defended the Claim and issued a counterclaim.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 25 and 26.</BOLD></P>
<P>13. Aftab brought a Motion in the Superior Court for an injuction where among other things he claimed occupation rent.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 27</BOLD></P>
<P>14. Justice Matheson, in her endorsement ordered Sarfraz to $2,000.00 per month until the matter is dealt with on the merits. Justice Matheson noted there will be proper account of the sums and that these payments are without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is in compliance with the order of Justice Matheson.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 27</BOLD></P>
<P>15. On December 7, 2016, on the first hearing of the L-1 Application based on the nonpayment of rent. Based on the faudulent lease agreement and misrepresentations made by the Plaintiff the Member orderd an eviction. The Plaintiff could not attend due to a Doctor's appintment and the Counel of the Plaintiff was out of the country.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 29</BOLD></P>
<P>16. The Defendant relied on the faudulent residential tenancy agreement and misinformed the Member that Sarfraz has lived at the Property since September 2013. The Defendnat did not advise the Member that Sarfraz has been living at the property since April 2012, or that I had paid him $62,000.00 as my half of the acquisition costs of the Property.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>CONCURRENT LITIGATION BY THE DEFENDANT IN SUPERIOR COURT</TI>
<P>17. Through a motion in the Suprior Court of Justice, Aftab requested the same relief of termination of the tenancy, vacant possession or occupancy costs until trial from the Suprior Court of Justice;</P>
<P>18. On January 30th, 2016, Justice Matheson heard the motion of the Defendants and ordered that the plaintiff pay the sum of $2000.00 pending adjudiction of the Action on merits. Justice Matheson noted that this sum will be accounted for and it is wihtout prejudice to the rights of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>19. The Plaintiff is in compliance with the order of the Justice Matheson.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 28</BOLD></P>
<P>20. Despite the offer of the Plaintiff to pursue the matter in the Superior Court only, the Defendants insisted on pursuing the matter before two forums as a &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo; measure as stated in the transcripts. At the hearing before the LTB Member, the Plaintiff was in hospital and the Counsel was out of the the country and hecne not in attendacne. The Member order eviction for non-payment of rent.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Sarfraz Affidavit at paras. 29 and 30</BOLD></P>
<P>21. Despite the protest of the Plaintiff, to recuse herself the same Member continued to hear the 2nd Application and granted the demolition application.
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at paras.30</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The Member, on December 4, 2017, once again passed an eviction order permitting the Defendants to demolish the Property
<P1><BOLD>Sarfraz Affidavit at para 31.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. The Divisional Court dismissed the Appeal of the Plaintiff on the ground that the Appellant can only succed on a standard of correctness. However at pargraph 42, the Divisional Court held &ldquo;</P>
<P>[42] <BOLD>The Board's decision was therefore reasonable even if it erred in also taking into account indicia of equitable ownership in reaching its decision that the Appellant was not a co-owner.</BOLD>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Warraich v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC1267</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>: Exhibit &ldquo;O&rsquo;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>[50] The two proceedings therefore involve the adjudication of separate and distinct interests in the property.</P>
<P>[51] As such, the Superior Court action will not be a re-adjudication of an issue such that there is a multiplicity of proceedings or that the proceeding before the Superior Court should be subject to issue estoppel.

<P>24. The divisional Court also held that the Landlord Tenant Board did not have jurisdiction to determin the equitable ownership.
<QUOTE><P>[57] Since the Board has no jurisdiction to determine equitable ownership rights and entitlements, the Appellant will not be prejudiced by the Board's decision in the litigation of those issues in the Superior Court, as the Board's findings on the issue of co-ownership are not binding on the Superior Court.

<P>[17] These are very separate proceedings that can proceed without any risk of conflicting decisions.

<P>[20] The appellant argues that, having been apprised of the existence of the Superior Court action, the Board should have gone on to inquire into the nature of that action. I do not agree. In order to address its jurisdiction, the Board is required to establish whether or not an alleged tenant is a registered co-owner or has been found to be a co-owner in a final judgement of the Superior Court. The nature of the appellant's claim, and any view of the merits of that claim, are matters that are beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.</P>

The threshold is a low one. The judge on the application must make a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. The decision of a lower court judge on the merits of the Charter claim is a relevant but not necessarily conclusive indication that the issues raised in an appeal are serious: see Metropolitan Stores, supra, at p. 150. Similarly, a decision by an appellate court to grant leave on the merits indicates that serious questions are raised, but a refusal of leave in a case which raises the same issues cannot automatically be taken as an indication of the lack of strength of the merits.</P>

<BLOCK3><TI>Application of the general principles in this case</TI>
<P>29. The Motion of Sarfraz is neither vexatious not frivolous.</P>
<P>30. Sarfraz has provided uncontrovertible evidence of payment of $62,000.00 which is more than the 50 % acquisiton costs of the Property under dispute.</P>
<P>31. Aftab has admitted receiving $62,000.00 as asserted by Sarfraz. Aftab, however says that it was for some electrical work on some of the properties. The Defendants have not proudced any invoices or any bills that equal the sum of $62,000.00 Mere bald assertions by the Aftab and computer generated spreadsheeets are the only evidence that Aftab has asserted as evidence;</P>
<P>32. The Defendant made several blatant misrerepresntatin before the LTB and the Memebr without hearing any evidence from the other side concluded that there was&rdquo; Lot of Prejudice to the Landlord&rdquo;);</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Tab K-1 Transcripts of the first hearing at Page 13 and 14</BOLD></P>
<P>33. Three credible witnesses arm's length witnesses through their sworn affidavits support the Plaintiff's positon.</P>
<P><BOLD>Reference: Motion Record of the Plaintiff Tab 5,6, and 7</BOLD></P>
<P>34. The Plaintiff's account is consistent and credible and he was unfazed and unshaken during cross-examination both in the Superor Court Action as well as before the LTB.</P>
<P>35. Aftab has admitted during cross-examination that he has lied consistently on his tax returns. The credibility of the Defendant is a live issue, which lends to the credibility and strong prima facie case of the Plaintiff;</P>
<P>36. Aftab has failed to produce any evidence of work done for $62,000.00 in the shap of any invoices or any bills or even demands of any payments. There is simply no basis for claiming that the $62,000.00 was the payment for &ldquo;electrical work&rdquo;).</P>
<P>37. The Plaintiff has contributed one half of the expenses of the Property from April 2012 to August 2016. In addition, the Plaintiff is compliant with the order of the Justice Matheson of the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>38. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Jurewicz v Jurewicz</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7563</CITE></CASEREF> wherein at paragraph 45, the Court while granting the stay note that;
<QUOTE><P>[45] Having regard to these principles and all of the circumstances in evidence, I therefore find that Mr. Jurewicz has raised an issue for the proposed appeal that is neither vexatious nor frivolous.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Whether the Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if the Relief is not granted ?</UNDER></TI>
<P>The Supreme Court of Canada in <BOLD><EM>RJR-McDonald</EM></BOLD> held that irreparable harm exists where &ldquo;a refusal to grant relief could so adversely affect the [Appellant's] own interests that the harm could not be remedied if the eventual decision on the merits does not accord with the result of the interlocutory application&rdquo;: see para. 63.</P>
<P>40. The demolition of one's home is a very serious issue. The Plaintiff believes he is an owner of the Property. The family of the Plaintiff has lived in the Property for the past six years or so. If an injunction is not granted the Plaintiff will suffer an irreparable harm;
<QUOTE><P>The notion of irreparable harm both incorporates and substitutes for the traditional discretionary barrier to equitable remedies; namely, proof that common law equities are inadequate.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Jeffrey Berryman, <EM>The Law of Equitable Remedies</EM>, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2013) at 30.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The submits that the believes he is an owner of the Property. The irreparable harm that the Plaintiff will suffer an irreparable harm as follows;
<P1>(a) If in fact, following a trial, if the Superior court Justice determines that Sarfraz has 50 % ownership of the Property, there will be no house left, as the Defendants intend to demolish the Property;</P1>
<P1>(b) The preservation of the property from demolition, therefor is of utmost importance to the Plaintiff and his family and for the preservation of their substantive rights.</P1>
<P1>(c) It will be impossible to determine what and how much money was spent by the Defendant on the Demolition of the renovation of the subject property;</P1>
<P1>(d) In <EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>, the SCC held that,
<QUOTE><P>&ldquo;Irreparable&rdquo; refers to the <EM>nature</EM> of the harm suffered rather than its magnitude. It is harm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or cannot be cured, usually because one party cannot collect damages from the other. [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>(e) The eviction, and demolition, before the adjudication of the Superior court will adversely impact on the reputation of the Plaintiff who is a respectable member of the community and is in the business of renovation. This will also harm his business with other members in his future business ventures.</P1>
<P1>(f) The Plaintiff a self-described electrician has not provided any evidence that he will be able to compensate the Plaintiff should the Superior Court determines that Sarfraz is entitled to one half of the Property. In fact, he had to obtain bridge financing during the purchase of the Property and hence he may never be in a position to compensate the Plaintiff</P1></P>
<P>42. The Plaintiff relies on Save the <CASEREF><SOC>Eaton's Building Coalition vs. Winnipeg (City)</SOC><CITE>2002 MBCA</CITE><PARANUM>12 and 21</PARANUM></CASEREF>.

<P>43. Sarfraz submits that it is only right and just in the circumstances that he is not deprived of his house, for which he commenced litigation in the Superior Court without adjudication and determination of his rights on the merits.</P>
<P>44. Sarfraz pleads that since he will be dispossessed of his home and will suffer irreparable loss that justice and equity of the situation in issue warrant the grant of the injunction. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Greig v. Kritikopoulou</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 4594 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> wherein the court held at paragraph 20 that;

<QUOTE><P>16 Regarding the second prong of the test (<BOLD>irreparable harm</BOLD>), assuming that the Plaintiff has a reasonable claim for an interest in the property, it follows that the Defendants' efforts to prepare for <BOLD>demolition</BOLD> of several buildings, erecting hoarding, removing vegetation, etc. is arguably demonstrative of <BOLD>irreparable harm</BOLD>, given the Plaintiff's stated intentions for the property. This situation is distinguished from that in <CASEREF><SOC>Woods Property Development Inc. v. Mintz</SOC><CITE>2002 CarswellOnt 1216</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont.

<P>47. Sarfraz says that should a Judge of the Superior Court of Justice makes a determination on the merits that he is not the 50% owenr of the Property, Aftab will not be in a worse position and will take his entitlement following the decision.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>The Balance of Convenience</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. The balance of concenience favours Sarfraz. Sarfraz is before the Court with clean hands and seeks relief for no improper purposes. Sarfraz only wants that this equitable rights should be decided on the merits.</P>
<P>49. Sarfraz has complied with the two orders of Justice Matheson and all payments in accordance with the Lease (the Sarfraz maintains was obtained on fraud) has been made. There is no money outstanding to the Defendants even on the fraudulent lease agreement.</P>
<P>50. In <CASEREF><SOC>South House Restoration Committee v. Rothesay Collegiate School</SOC><CITE>2006 NBQB 120 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> the court held as follows;
<QUOTE><P>[64] The factors which must be considered in assessing the balance of convenience test are numerous and will vary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual case.</P>
<P>[65] The interlocutory procedure seeks only to balance the risk of harm to the applicant if injunctive relief is denied, against the risk of harm to the defendant should the injunction be granted.</P>
<P>[66] I must consider the potential impact of the injunction on each party. Does the benefit occurring to the Association from granting the injunction outweigh the inconvenience that will be suffered by the School?</P>
<P>[69] This is not a case where, as a practical matter, the granting of an interlocutory injunction will effectively end the litigation. If it were, I would have to look further at the merits of the case. But in this case, actually, it is just the opposite. If the injunction is not granted, South House could be demolished immediately, and the relief sought by the plaintiff will be rendered moot. If I do not grant the injunction, the result of this interlocutory motion will in effect amount to a final determination of the action.</P></QUOTE>

<P>51. While the Defendant, who lives in Richmond Hill in [location omitted] the Plaintiff and his family consider the Property home and has lived there for the past 6 years. The delay in the construction of a new home by a few months is the only only prejudice that the Defendant can point to. On the other hand, Sarfraz and his family will be disposed from their home and the demolition will deprive of their rights when they do not want the demolition pending a determination by the court of their rights.</P>
<P>52. The Defendant will not be prejudiced by awaiting adjudication by the Superior Court as the Action has been set-down for trial on the other hand, the Plaintiff will be dispossessed of the Property which is his home as well as the home of his family whereas following demolition, there will be nothing left of the house where Sarfraz has paid half of the acquisition costs and half of the carrying costs since 2012 to date.</P>
<P>53. Sarfraz relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Jurewicz v Jurewicz</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7563</CITE></CASEREF> wherein at Paragraph 57, the Court observed that the balance of convenience narrowly favoured a the Moving party because the sale of the matrimonial home would have permanently impaired his rights</P>
<P>54. The court of Appeal for Ontario in <CASEREF><SOC>1465152 Ontario Limited v. Amexon Development Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 86 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF> of hled:
<QUOTE><P>[23] As the law in Ontario currently stands, different considerations apply in the latter circumstance, as was explained in Robert J. Sharpe, <EM>Injunctions and Specific Performance</EM>, loose-leaf (consulted on 30 January 2015), (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2014), at 4.10 and 4.20:</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Where the plaintiff complains of an interference with property rights, injunctive relief is strongly favored. This is especially so in the case of direct infringement in the nature of trespass.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>The reason for the primacy of injunctive relief is that an injunction more accurately reflects the substantive definition of property than does a damages award. It is the very essence of the concept of property that the owner should not be deprived without consent. An injunction brings to bear coercive powers to vindicate that right. Compensatory damages for a continuous and wrongful interference with a property interest offers only limited protection in that the plaintiff is, in effect, deprived of property without consent at an objectively determined price. Special justification is required for damages rather than an injunction if the principle of autonomous control over property is to be preserved. A damages award rather than an injunction permits the defendant to carry on interfering with the plaintiff's property. [Footnotes omitted</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. In paragraph 20 the Court held as follows;
<QUOTE><P>[28] In addition, the application judge balanced the parties' respective interests and tailored the scope of the injunction to that which was necessary to restrain the specific unlawful conduct of the Landlord&mdash;i.e. its intention to trespass onto the leased premises pursuant to the Notice to Vacate in order to terminate the tenancy. His endorsement clearly states that the injunctionwould not protect the Tenant from the consequences of future breaches or future application of the Lease, nor did it address the issue of the right of the Tenant to renew the Lease upon the expiry of its current term on March 31, 2016.</P>
<P>In the instant case, there will not be a mere trespass, there will be a demolition of the Property and should a court of Competent jurisdiction determine that Plaintiff, is entitled to one half of the Property with a house on it, the house would have been demolished.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>1465152 Ontario Limited v. Amexon Development Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 86 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>BOA TAB 8</BOLD></P>
<P>56. Sarfraz submits that the final analysis in the instant case must be driven by what is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case and whether the Defendant should be allowed to demolish the house when the Plaintiff's rights of ownership have not been determined and where he will suffer irreparable harm whereas the only harm that the Defendant will suffer will be a delay of a few months in the demolition of the Property.</P>
<P>57. Plaintiff's Undertaking</P>
<P>In Ontario, Rule 40.03 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> stipulates that:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>40.03</N><TI>Undertaking</TI>
<SECP>On a motion for an interlocutory injunction or mandatory order, the moving party shall, unless the court orders otherwise, undertake to abide by any order concerning damages that the court may make if it ultimately appears that the granting of the order has caused damage to the responding party for which the moving party ought to compensate the responding party.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>The plaintiff has provided the required undertaking in damages, which is &ldquo;meaningful.&rdquo; It is the Plaintiff's position that the Plaintiff has a compelling case and this Honourable Court has the discretion dispense with the Undertaking. As the Plaintiff has a compelling case. If the plaintiff is ultimately unsuccessful at trial, the defendant will be able to claim damages for the harm suffered as a result of the improperly obtained in junction.</P>
<P>(e) The unjustified eviction would constitute immediate distress to the plaintiffs and their children. It would also permanently deprive them of their rights and their home which far outweighed the inconvenience of to the Defendants to wait for a determination of the rights on merit by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>(f) The Moving parties relies on the Affidavit evidence of the Plaintiff and three supporting and uncontroverted affidavits of witnesses and other evidence forming part of the Motion Record;</P>
<P>(g) Because the eviction and demolition of the Property would seriously prejudice the rights of the plaintiff, the Plaintiff seeks the immediate remedy of an injunction, granting a stay of the eviction. If the immediate remedy is not granted, the demolition of the house, for which the Defendant has an order from the LTB, and which has been the stated intention of the Defendants,will impair the rigts of the Plaintiff such that by the time of a final determination it would be impossible to fashion a proper remedy.</P>
<P>(h) It is respectfully submitted that the Moving Party has satisfied the Test laid down in RJR-McDonald and it is just and equitable and it respectfully requests die relief as pleaded pending a determination of the rights on the merits.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<LINE>Lawyers for the Defendants</LINE></P>
<P>I, Sarfraz Warraich, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am the Respondent in this Motion on Issue Estoppel. I am also the Plaintiff in Court File No. CV16-563338 where AFTAB AHMED CHOUDHRY and YASMIN NUZHAT are the Defendants and as such, I have knowledge of the matters herein deposed.</P>
<P>1. I have known Aftab since 2000 in Toronto, ON. We belong to the same town, Gujarat in Pakistan. We have been friends for a long time and had family relations.</P>
<P>2. In March 2012, Aftab purchased [location omitted]. On and at the same time sold his home Richmond Hill. The deal of his home fell through, and he had to carry two properties at the same time.</P>
<P>3. I am in the business of renovation of real property. Aftab used to attend to my properties and before becoming a licenced electician I asked the electricians I hired to assist him. Aftab approached me and offered me 50% of partnership on [location omitted] (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;). I accepted his offer. Pursuant to that Agreement, I along with my family moved into the Property in April 2012 and has lived there ever since.</P>
<P>4. I, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) pursuant to a verbal agreement in March 2012, paid the sum of $62,000.00 to the Defendant, Aftab Choudhry (&ldquo; Aftab&rdquo;) as my half share of the acquisition of the Property for a 50% ownership interest in in the Property by April 2013. I have also paid half of the carrying costs of the Property from April 2012 to date. I simply wants a determination of my property rights by the Superior Court of Justice on the merits.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; Proof of payment of $62,000.00 to the Affidavit of Sarfraz Warraich dated November 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Sarfraz Affidavit&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. In 2012, initially, we decided to carry the property, obtain permits, renovate and sell the property for profit. We also decided that I will live in the property and will contribute $2,000.00 per month towards the carrying costs of the Property. At the end of every year, Aftab provided me an accounting of other costs related to the Property and I paid half of those additional costs.</P>
<P>6. Following moving into the property in 2012, I approached LEMCAD, the consultants, who had worked for me on other projects and asked them to obtain the required permits for [location omitted] I paid the consultants, LEMCAD $20,000.00 as I was a partner and owner and carried all the liaison with them.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; Contract between LEMCAD and Sarfraz to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. During this time, pursuant to a verbal agreement Aftab was also a partner with me [location omitted]. As I never suspected any foul, play from Aftab or his brother. I paid Aftab $90,000.00 for the Waterloo property that included his profit as well the return of his investment. Aftab had done electrical work for many of the my properties, all pursuant to verbal agreements.</P>
<P>8. In 2014, Aftab and his brother Ashfaq Ahmed who filed my taxes as well as the taxes of Aftab, induced me to sign a residential tenancy agreement by a fraudulent misrepresentation that it was &ldquo;required it for tax purposes&rdquo;. I trusted Aftab and his brother who was my accountant.</P>
<P>9. In 2016, following the approval in OMB of the proposed new structure of the house on the Property, Aftab told me that he wanted to keep the property, and wanted to pay me for my ownership share. In April/May 2016, we negotiated our respective share in the Property. We could not agree on the market price of the Property and cost/commission etc. as Aftab wanted to pay me as less as possible. This was despite the fact that I offered him more money, then he was offering me.</P>
<P>10. Finally, with the help of friends, Aftab and me reached an Agreement. We executed that Agreement on September 2, 2016 in the presence of Leo of LEMBCAD. I insisted that Aftab pay a deposit, for faithful performance of the Agreement. Aftab paid the sum of $20,000.00 as deposit less monies owed for my share for 3 months on account of the property.</P>
<P>11. Aftab promised that he will pay my share after one year, because I had paid him the acquisition costs for the Property one year later. I agreed to receive the money one year later and Aftab agreed to secure my interest by grant of a mortgage.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Written Agreement of September 2, 2016 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; Copy of the deposit cheque to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Later in September, 2016, Aftab reneged on the written Agreement of September 2, 2016 and refused to sign the documents that were sent to his lawyer for the grant of mortgage. Aftab now wanted to refinance the property before the grant of the mortgage. This was not acceptable to me.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; copy of Documents sent to the lawyer of Aftab to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. I instructed my lawyer to put a Caution on the Property.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; the Copy of the Caution and Letter to Defedant's lawyer to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Later, on November 1, 2016, I commenced a Statement of Claim in the Superior Court based on my equitable rights in the Property.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; the Statement of claim to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. On November 7, 2016, The Defendants through their Defence and Counterclaim defended the claim, and took the position that he, i.e. Aftab was the Landlord and that I was a Tenant, pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement that began on March 1, 2013.</P>
<P>16. The Defendant made no mention in their Defence that I have lived in the Property since April 2012, pursuant to the verbal agreement. The Defendants also never claimed any monies that they later said I owed them, as justification for the $62,000.00 that I had paid Aftab or for the $90,000.00 that I had paid Aftab as his share in the [location omitted] property.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; Statement of Defence and Counterclaim to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The Defendant concurrently commenced two applications in Landlord Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) dated, November 1, 2016 one for eviction, one based on non-payment of rent and the other, for the demolition of the property based on the permit that I had helped obtain through LECAD, the consultants. In both the applications, Aftab claimed that he alleged tenancy commenced <UNDER>on March 1 2013;</UNDER>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; the Copies of the application to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The LTB hearing took place without my presence or my lawyer's participation. I could not attend the LTB hearing as I had a doctor's appointment that day. My lawyer was out of country due to family emergency.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; Doctors slip to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. The paralegal attended on my behalf and requested an adjournment. The LTB Member, despite being advised of the proceedings before the Superior Court, refused to grant an adjournment, and assumed that my non-attendance was deliberate, when in fact, I had a doctor's appointment, the same very day.</P>
<P>20. At the hearing on December 7, 2016, only Aftab gave evidence, and his lawyer made arguments which are factually incorrect. The lawyer for the Defendant advised the Member that there was a certificate of pending litigation on the property which is a factually wrong statement. There was never a Certificate of Pending Litigation on the Property. The Lawyer advised the Member about a telephone call from Sarfraz, for which he produced no evidence and which I never made.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; Transcripts of L-1 hearing dated December 7, 2016 at page 8, 9 and 13 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The member, influenced by the submissions of the Defendant's counsel, and without hearing any evidence whatsoever, made up her mind and on page 14 of the transcript after listening only to the counsel of the Plaintiff, declared that &ldquo;I see a lot of prejudice to the Landlord&rdquo;. She als concluded that there was no prejudice to the Tenant. The actual evidence of Aftab only began on page 32 of the transcripts.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo; Transcripts L-1 application December 7, 2015 page 14 and 32 to Sarfraz Affidvit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The Defendant at the said hearing of December 7, 2016, produced the residential tenancy agreement and on oath declared that the residential tenancy Agreement commenced on March 1, 2013. Aftab never disclosed to the Member that I have lived at the Property since April, 2012.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo; Transcript L-1 Application dated December 7, 2016 page 40 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. The only other evidence that was presented at the hearing of December 7, 2016 were the text messages between Aftab and me. The said text messages were only provided to Mr. Bush, the paralegal, during the actual testimony. When Mr. Bush objected, the Member declared that there are no specific rules for disclosure that required disclosure in advance and that he (Mr. Zweig) will give you copies as the testimony goes along. At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr. Bush also requested that another Member hears the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> application which was denied by the Member.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo; Transcript from L-1 Application dated December 7, 2016 page 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 47 and 48 to Sarfraz Affidavit.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. The Member ordered the my eviction for non-payment of rent.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit&rdquo;O&rdquo; Order of the Landlord Tenant Board dated December 14, 2016 to Sarfraz Affidavit.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. I have lived in the Property since April 2012 pursuant to the verbal agreement. The Defendant never disclosed this fact to LTB member during the hearing. The Defendant suppressed that information in order to gain maximum advantage at the first hearing which was almost an ex-parte hearing. Only the lawyer for the Defendant made submissions and the evidence was not disclosed to the paralegal who attended to request an adjournment.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo; Proof of living at the Property to Sarfraz Affidavit.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. The Defendant had brought a motion returnable January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 in the Superior Court of Justice for the same relief that he had claimed before the LTB. Before the LTB, the lawyer for the Defendant had declared that motion to be a &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo; measure at page 13 of the transcripts at the December 7 hearing before the LTB Member. The Defendant swore an affidavit in the Superior Court wherein he claimed that the alleged tenancy commenced on <UNDER>March 1, 2013</UNDER>. The Defendant never claimed all the amounts that he later alleged;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo; Affidavit of Aftab to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. On January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, Justice Matheson ordered that I remain in possession and ordered payment of $2,000.00 per month, without prejudice to my rights. I have fully complied with that order.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo; Order of Justice Matheson to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>MATERIAL FACT OF SARFRAZ LIVING AT THE PROPERTY SINCE 2012 ONLY DISCLOSED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION</TI>
<P>28. Only during cross-examination on the L-2 Application for the demolition did the Defendant, Aftab admit that in fact I was living with my family in the Property since April 2012, without a residential tenancy Agreement. He had no answer to why he did not disclose this fact before the LTB.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo; Transcripts of the LTB of April 5, 2017 page 117 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. Despite the offer of the Plaintiff to pursue the matter in the Superior Court only, the Defendants insisted on pursuing the matter before two forums and continued with the L-2 Application before the same Member of the LTB.</P>
<P>30. Despite the protest of the Plaintiff, and the raising of the issue of Bias, and a request to recuse herself, the same Member continued to hear the 2nd Application stated she had assumed jurisdiction.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo; Transcripts of the LTB L-2 of April 5, 2017 page73 and 74 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. On the L-2 application the Member reached the same decision and ordered my eviction.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo; L-2 Order of the Landlord Tenant Board dated December 4, 2017 to Sarfraz Affidavit</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. The Member also made factual errors during the evaluation of the evidence on the L-2 application. In paragraph 15, of her order on the L-2 application she declared Ishfaq Choudhry (&ldquo;IC&rdquo;) to be my brother. Ishfaq Choudhry is the brother of the Defendant, Aftab Choudhry and not my brother.</P>
<P>33. In paragraph 25, of her order on the L-2 application the Member stated that the email admitting receipt of $15,000 was from the Tenant to the Landlord. In fact, the email was sent by the alleged landlord, Aftab to Sarfraz, wherein, the Aftab admitted through his own email that he had received $15,000.00 from Sarfraz.</P>
<P>34. I am advised by my lawyer and I verily believe it to be true that the Member misperceived the evidence and the testimony. The Member in her finding gave short shrift to the written agreement that was signed and executed before an arm's length third party. Those finding are not binding on the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>35. The Member did not make any finding about the payment of $62,000.00 that was paid by me and accepted by Aftab. The Member did not make any mention as to why at the first hearing, Aftab stated under oath that the tenancy began in March 1, 2013. Having taken advantage of the suppression of fact, Aftab now declared that I have lived at the property since April, 2013.</P>
<P>36. The Defendant came up with flimsy explanations and justification for the payment of $62,000.00 and $90,000.00 through an excel spread sheet that he himself prepared. There are no cancelled cheques, bank drafts or any evidence to prove that I owed the Defendant all that money. The Defendant has attempted to justify that I had paid him through his credit card, which is absurd.</P>
<P>37. The Defendant never made any demands for that money before I issued the Statement of Claim and his explanation is now a justification for the facts that I have advanced.</P>
<P>38. The Defendant's relying on the alleged tenancy agreement, continued to pursue the matter through the LTB as they did not want to a determination through the Superior Court. This motion is continuation of that effort so that they can deny my rights such that the Superior Court cannot make a determination on the merits based on the relevant and probative evidence.</P>
<P>39. I am advised by my lawyer and I verily believe it to be true that the ownership rights of litigants in real property can only be decided by the Superior Court of Justice. And that the complex issues of contract law are not within the jurisdiction of the LTB. The Divisional Court on Appeals from the orders of the LTB member has already made their decision on that matter. The Defendant, through this motion have attempted to made a collateral attack on the order of the Divisional court.</P>
<P>40. I request that this court that my rights be decided on the merits, based on the relevant and probative evidence and not on the determination of an LTB Member who has prejudiced my rights and who did not have the jurisdiction or the expertise to decide the ownership rights of litigants in Ontario.</P>
<P>41. I make this affidavit in support of my position on this motion and in rebuttal of the relief the defendants have requested and for no other purpose.</P>
<P>I make this affidavit for no improper purposes.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANTS ON ISSUE ESTOPPEL</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. The Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warriach (&ldquo;Warriach&rdquo;), commenced this action against the Defendants Aftab Ahmad Choudhry (&ldquo;Choudhry&rdquo;) and his wife Nuzhat Yasmin (&ldquo;Yasmin&rdquo;) seeking, among other things, a declaration that he holds an equitable ownership interest in [location omitted](the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>2. Warriach continues to seek to have the issues of the landlord and tenant relationship, rent and co-ownership litigated in these proceedings despite the fact that those issues have already been considered and determined by the Landlord and Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;). The Defendants assert that he is precluded from doing so by virtue of the issue estoppel doctrine.</P1>
<P1>3. The Defendants therefore bring this motion for an order that this Court will not hear or consider any evidence on the issues expressly or necessarily determined by the LTB and in particular that:
<P2>(a) Choudhry and Warriach were in a landlord and tenant relationship pursuant to the written tenancy agreement between the parties;</P2>
<P2>(b) the tenancy agreement was not procured under duress or undue influence;</P2>
<P2>(c) the monthly payments made by Warriach to Choudhry were rent; and</P2>
<P2>(d) Warriach was not a co-owner of the Property.</P2></P1>
<P1>4. The Defendants respectfully submit that the LTB had the authority to determine each of these issues and that those determinations are binding on the parties to this action. The orders made by the LTB were affirmed on appeal by the Divisional Court.</P1>
<P1>5. The Defendants further submit that the LTB had the authority to determine whether Warriach was an owner of the Property despite the nature of the ownership interest asserted. That is, the LTB had the power to determine whether or not Warriach was an owner on the bases of either legal or equitable ownership and that the LTB's finding that Warriach was not a &ldquo;co-owner&rdquo; estops him from arguing otherwise in this Court.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Background</TI>
<P><P1>6. The Defendants purchased the Property in March of 2012 with a view to renovating and selling it. They paid the down payment with their own funds, arranged mortgage financing and completed the purchase on their own without any assistance from the Plaintiff.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, dated November 7, 2016, &para; 4.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>7. The Plaintiff and the Defendants had known each other for a long time and had become friends. The Plaintiff needed a place to live as he intended to purchase and renovate another property that would not be ready for some time. The parties agreed that the Plaintiff would move into the Property with his family and pay rent.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, &para;&para; 6-7.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>8. The Defendants had no immediate plans to demolish the Property. Thus, a formal written tenancy agreement dated March 1, 2013 was entered into naming Choudhry as landlord and Warriach as tenant. The terms of the tenancy agreement were that of a month-to-month tenancy commencing on March 1, 2013 with rent payable in the amount of $2,000 per month. Utilities were to be paid by the tenant.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, &para;&para; 8-9.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>9. Choudhry knew that Warriach had experience as a general contractor and in renovating properties. Choudhry and Warriach entered into a handwritten agreement dated September 2, 2016 prepared by Leo Mastrandrea, the architect retained by the Defendants for the project, setting out their respective rights and obligations regarding the renovation of the Property. Warriach would act as general contractor and would construct a new dwelling in accordance with plans drawn up by the architect up to the dry-wall ready stage for the stated amount of $204,500. The parties agreed that a more formal agreement would be entered at a later date. The agreement also confirmed that the Plaintiff and the Defendants were not in any form of joint ownership with respect to the Property.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, &para;&para; 11&ndash;15.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>10. Monthly rent in the amount of $2,000 was paid for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and until June 1, 2016. The handwritten agreement of September 2, 2016 confirmed the arrears of rent that had accumulated between June and September of that year.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, &para;&para; 10 and 16.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>11. The September 2, 2016 agreement also provided that Warriach and his family would vacate the premises by October 4, 2016. However, the relationship between the parties broke down. Warriach and his family did not vacate the Property on October 4, 2016 and made no further rent payments.
<P2><BOLD>Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, &para;&para; 20&ndash;24.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The LTB Proceedings</TI>
<P><P1>12. Choudhry commenced two applications against Warriach before the Landlord and Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) seeking termination of the tenancy and eviction under the <EM>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</EM> (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) for non-payment of rent and for demolition for the purposes of constructing a new dwelling. Both applications were granted. The LTB found that the parties were in a landlord and tenant relationship and that the monthly payments made by Warriach were rent. The LTB also rejected Warriach's argument that he was a co-owner of the Property. Warriach appealed both orders to the Divisional Court, which dismissed the appeals and affirmed the LTB's orders for termination and eviction.</P1>
<P1>13. Choudhry's application to terminate the tenancy for non-payment of rent (the &ldquo;L1 Application&rdquo;) was granted by LTB Member Anna Solomon on December 14, 2016. Member Solomon quantified the arrears of rent owed by Warriach from June to December 2016 based on the agreed rental of $2,000 per month.
<P2><BOLD>LTB Interim Order, File No. TSL-78963-16-IN, dated December 14, 2016.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record, Tab 2</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>14. The L2 Application was subsequently heard over 3 days from April 5, 2017 through September 19, 2017. The parties and their legal representatives attended. In addition to providing his own testimony, Warriach called three witness to testify on his behalf: Leo Mastrandrea, Chaudhry Waheed Akhtar and Shahid Awan. These witnesses are the same witnesses Warriach intends to call at the trial of this action.
<P2><BOLD>LTB Order under Section 69, <EM>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</EM>, File No. TSL-78963-16, dated December 4, 2017 (&ldquo;LTB Order&rdquo;), p. 1.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>15. The very same issues Warriach wants the Court to determine in this trial were argued before and adjudicated by Member Solomon on the L2 Application. After hearing the testimony of the witnesses and considering the documentary evidence tendered, she concluded that Warriach was a tenant as that word is defined in the Act and not an owner of the Property, stating:
<QUOTE><P>Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord and his wife are the only owners of the residential complex. There was insufficient evidence before me to establish that the Tenant has any ownership rights or interest in the Property.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD>LTB Order, &para; 6,</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>16. Member Solomon rejected Warriach's argument that the parties agreed that Warriach would receive a 50% ownership interest in it in exchange for his payment of 50% of the down payment, in the amount of $62,000, and assumption of 50% of the carrying costs of the Property. After considering the evidence Member Solomon concluded that Warriach had not established that he had an ownership interest in the Property. The cheques tendered only established that the parties had a history of doing business together and lending money to each other.
<P2><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 20&ndash;26.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>17. Member Solomon also rejected Warriach's argument that a written agreement between the parties dated September 2, 2016, was an agreement for the purchase by Choudhry of Warriach's 50% interest in the Property for the aggregate amount of $204,500. Rather, she accepted Choudhry's explanation that the agreement was for the payment of the stated amount to Warriach as project manager for the construction of a new dwelling on the site &ldquo;up to the drywall&rdquo;.
<P2><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para;30&ndash;33.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>18. Member Solomon rejected Warriach's submission that an unsigned, undated draft agreement identifying only Choudhry and Yasmin as owners of the Property was an agreement to secure Warriach's his ownership interest in the Property.
<P2><BOLD>LTB Order, &para; 35</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>19. Member Solomon found that the balance of the evidence tendered established that Warriach was a tenant and not an owner, namely:
<P2>a. The building permit for the construction of the new dwelling listing only Choudhry and Yasmin but not Warriach as owners of the Property;
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para; 9.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2>
<P2>The tenancy agreement dated March 1, 2013 signed by Choudhry and Warriach clearly identifying the former as landlord and the latter as tenant and providing for monthly rent in the amount of $2,000. Member Solomon rejected Warriach's evidence that he signed the agreement under duress or undue influence;
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 10&ndash;16.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2>
<P2>The statement of adjustments and closing letter from the Defendants' real estate lawyer, indicating that Choudhry and Yasmin were the only purchasers and owners of the Property and that they were taking title as joint tenants;
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 17&ndash;19.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2>
<P2>b. Text messages between Choudhry and Warriach in April and September of 2016, which Member Solomon found to be evidence confirming that Warriach understood and agreed that he was paying rent in exchange for the right to occupy the premises; and
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 27&ndash;29 and 34.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2>
<P2>The invoice from Leo Mastrandrea, who was the architect for the construction of the new dwelling, dated August 18, 2016, referring only to Choudhry and not Warriach.
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 36&ndash;38.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2>
<P2>Member Solomon concluded,</P2>
<P2>Based on the evidence above, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that 1) the Landlord and his wife are the only owners of the residential complex; and 2) the Tenant satisfies the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in the Act.</P2>
<P2>I find that the Tenant meets the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; because the parties signed a tenancy agreement that defined their relationship as landlord and tenant. There is no objective evidence before me to suggest that the tenancy agreement was not intended to govern the relationship between the parties. Further, the text messages between the parties from 2016 as well as the agreement signed on September 2, 2016 acknowledge the Tenant's obligation to pay rent. There is no convincing evidence before me to establish that the Tenant is an owner of the residential complex, which would exclude him from the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.</P2>
<P2>Having made the above findings, I am also satisfied on a balance of probabilities that this application involves a landlord and a tenant and I have jurisdiction to determine the matter. Since there is no dispute that the Landlord has otherwise satisfied the legal test for this application, the application is granted.
<P3><BOLD>LTB Order, &para;&para; 39&ndash;41.</BOLD></P3>
<P3><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 3</BOLD></P3></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The Appeals</TI>
<P><P1>20. As stated, Warriach appealed both the LTB Interim Order and the LTB Order to the Divisional Court. The appeal from the LTB Interim Order arising from the L1 Application was dismissed in its entirety. Wilton-Siegel J., writing for the Court, found that the LTB had the jurisdiction to determine whether Warriach was a tenant for the purposes of the Act, and further that Member Solomon's decision that he was a tenant &ldquo;was not only reasonable but correct.&rdquo;
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Warriach v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1275</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, &para; 19, Motion Record Tab 4</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>21. The appeal from the LTB Order arising out of the L2 Application was also dismissed. Thorburn J. gave the reasons for the decision and concluded, on the basis of the tenancy agreement, the uncontroverted evidence that Warriach did not have a legal ownership interest and the other evidence before the LTB, that Member Solomon's decision that Warriach was a &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; within the meaning of the Act was reasonable.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Warriach v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1267</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, &para; 43.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Motion Record Tab 5</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>22. In dismissing the appeal, Justice Thorburn concluded that the LTB did not have jurisdiction to determine whether or not Warriach had an equitable interest in the Property as the LTB has no jurisdiction to determine equitable rights or entitlements. However, no authority was cited by the court for that proposition. Furthermore, the Court was of the view that the issue before this Court is the existence, if any, of Warriach's asserted equitable interest. As such, the proceedings before the LTB and the Superior Court involve separate and distinct interests in the Property. Accordingly, the Court opined, &ldquo;there will not be a re-adjudication of an issue such that there is a multiplicity of proceedings or that the proceeding before the Superior Court should be subject to issue estoppel.&rdquo; Again, no authority was cited for this proposition. Warriach made no legal submissions on the issue and no explication of the parameters of the issue estoppel doctrine or its application to the findings of Member Solomon was given by the Court.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Warriach v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1267</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>&para; 51, Motion Record Tab 5</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Issue Estoppel</TI>
<P><P1>23. The Defendants submit that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to the findings of fact and the legal conclusions Member Solomon drew from those facts so as to preclude Warriach from re-litigating them before this Court.</P1>
<P1>24. The parameters of the modern approach to issue estoppel were set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</SOC></CASEREF> in which Binnie J., writing for the court, stated:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>20</BOLD> The law has developed a number of techniques to prevent abuse of the decision-making process. ...</P>
<P><BOLD>21</BOLD> These rules were initially developed in the context of prior court proceedings. They have since been extended, with some necessary modifications, to decisions classified as being of a judicial or quasi -judicial nature pronounced by administrative officers and tribunals. In that context the more specific objective is to balance fairness to the parties with the protection of the administrative decision-making process, whose integrity would be undermined by too readily permitting collateral attack or relitigation of issues once decided.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>24</BOLD> Issue estoppel was more particularly defined by Middleton J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>McIntosh v. Parent</SOC><CITE>[1924] 4 D.L.R. 420</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 422</PAGENUM></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>When a question is litigated, the judgment of the Court is a final determination as between the parties and their privies. Any right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue and directly determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery, or as an answer to a claim set up, cannot be re-tried in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies, though for a different cause of action. The right, question, or fact, once determined, must, as between them, be taken to be conclusively established so long as the judgment remains. [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>... The question out of which the estoppel is said to arise must have been &ldquo;fundamental to the decision arrived at&rdquo; in the earlier proceeding. In other words, as discussed below, the estoppel extends to the material facts and the conclusions of law or of mixed fact and law (&ldquo;the questions&rdquo;) that were necessarily (even if not explicitly) determined in the earlier proceedings.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 44</CITE><PARANUM>20&ndash;24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 1</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>25. More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized the modem deferential approach to administrative decisions in <CASEREF><SOC>Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board)</SOC></CASEREF>, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>31</BOLD> Issue estoppel, with its residual discretion, applies to administrative tribunal decisions. The legal framework governing the exercise of this discretion is set out in <EM>Danyluk</EM>. In our view, this framework has not been overtaken by this Court's subsequent jurisprudence. The discretion requires the courts to take into account the range and diversity of structures, mandates and procedures of administrative decision makers however, the discretion must not be exercised so as to, in effect, sanction collateral attack, or to undermine the integrity of the administrative scheme. As highlighted in this Court's jurisprudence, particularly since <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 190</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, legislation establishing administrative tribunals reflects the policy choices of the legislators and administrative decision making must be treated with respect by the courts. However, as this Court said in <EM>Danyluk</EM>, at para. 67: &ldquo;The objective is to ensure that the operation of issue estoppel promotes the orderly administration of justice but not at the cost of real injustice in the particular case.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board)</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 4</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>26. The court in <EM>Danyluk</EM> described the following three preconditions to be met in order for issue estoppel to apply:
<P2>(1) the same question raised in the subsequent proceedings was decided in the prior proceedings;</P2>
<P2>(2) the decision in the prior proceedings which is said to create the estoppel was final; and</P2>
<P2>(3) the parties to the prior decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.
<P3><BOLD><EM>Danyluk</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, &para; 25.</BOLD></P3></P2></P1>
<P1>27. Thus, issue estoppel applies to decisions made by administrative tribunals such as the Landlord and Tenant Board. Furthermore, the doctrine applies to the material facts and the conclusions of law or mixed fact and law that were necessarily determined in the prior proceedings.</P1>
<P1>28. The Defendants submit that the three preconditions for the application of issue estoppel are met regarding the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by Member Solomon in the proceedings before the LTB. The first two preconditions are clearly satisfied in this case. That is, the same questions raised in this action were decided by Member Solomon. Further, those decisions were final and were affirmed upon appeal.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Privity</TI>
<P><P1>29. While Yasmin was not party to the LTB proceedings, the Defendants submit that she was a privy of Choudhry. As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in <EM>Danyluk</EM>, the concept of privity is somewhat elastic. Yasmin is Choudhry's wife but took no part in her husband's business affairs. However, she and her husband own the Property as joint tenants.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Danyluk</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, &para; 60.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>30. Privity may be established through blood, title or interest. In <CASEREF><SOC>Monteiro v. Toronto Dominion Bank</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal re-iterated that principle, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>45</BOLD> The motion judge was also correct in concluding that TD was a privy in interest to Joseph. A person may be a privy of another by blood, title or interest: see <CASEREF><SOC>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd. (No. 2)</SOC><CITE>[1967] A.C. 853</CITE><COURTJUR>H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at 910. As there is no question of blood or title in this case, only privity of interest need be considered. The concept of privity of interest is explained by Megarry V.C. in the seminal case of <CASEREF><SOC>Gleeson v. J. Wippell &amp; Co. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 3 All E.R. 54 (Ch.)</CITE><PAGENUM>at 59-60</PAGENUM></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he doctrine of privity for these purposes is somewhat narrow, and has to be considered in relation to the fundamental principle <EM>nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa</EM>.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>I do not say that one must be the <EM>alter ego</EM> of the other: but it does seem to me that, having due regard to the subject-matter of the dispute, there must be a sufficient degree of identification between the two to make it just to hold that the decision to which one was party should be binding in proceedings to which the other is party. It is in that sense that I would regard the phrase privity of interest.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Monteiro v. Toronto Dominion Batik</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 137</CITE><PARANUM>45</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 2</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>31. The Defendants submit that Yasmin shares a sufficient community of interest with Choudhry such that she is his privy. As joint owner of the Property, it is proper to conclude that she should be bound by the LTB's decisions affecting the Property.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The Ownership Issue</TI>
<P><P1>32. As stated, the Defendants assert that Warriach is precluded on the basis of issue estoppel from re-litigating the findings of fact and legal determinations made by Member Solomon, including the determination that he was not a co-owner of the Property. This is so despite the distinction drawn by the Divisional Court between legal and equitable interests.</P1>
<P1>33. In order to determine whether she had jurisdiction to hear the matter, Member Solomon was required to determine whether Warriach was a tenant for the purposes of the Act. &ldquo;Tenant&rdquo; is defined in s. 2(1) of the Act to include:
<QUOTE><P>... a person who pays rent in return for the right to occupy a rental unit and includes the tenant's heirs, assigns and personal representatives, but &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; does not include a person who has the right to occupy a rental unit by virtue of being,
<P1>(a) a co-owner of the residential complex in which the rental unit is located, or</P1>
<P1>(b) a shareholder of a corporation that owns the residential complex;</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</EM>, S.O. 2006, c. 17, s. 2(1). Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>34. In so doing, Member Solomon was empowered by s. 174 of the Act &ldquo;to hear and determine <UNDER>all questions of law</UNDER> and fact with respect to all matters within its jurisdiction under this Act.&rdquo; [Emphasis added]
<P2><BOLD><EM>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, s. 174. Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>35. Thus, in order to find that Warriach was a tenant, Member Solomon had to determine whether or not he was a &ldquo;co-owner&rdquo; of the Property. Member Solomon had the authority to determine all questions of law and fact on that very issue. No distinction is drawn in the Act between legal and equitable interests. Nor does the Act limit the LTB's authority to determine only legal interests. Had the legislature intended to so limit the LTB's authority, it would have expressly stated that the LTB does not, when considering the definition of tenant, have the jurisdiction to determine a claim of equitable co-ownership.</P1>
<P1>36. The legislature did not do so. The Defendants submit that it must be presumed that the legislature intended the LTB to have full authority to determine all questions of ownership regardless of the nature of the ownership interest when determining whether a person is or is not a tenant. This would of necessity include claims of equitable ownership.</P1>
<P1>37. The LTB has on several occasions considered whether or not a party is an owner for the purposes of determining whether that party was included or excluded from the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in the Act. For example, in <EM>TNL-69115-15-SA</EM>, the LTB rejected a claim made by a tenant that she was the actual or beneficial owner of the rental unit in question. After reviewing the evidence regarding ownership, Member Pernal concluded that the tenant had not discharged her burden of showing on a balance of probabilities that the Act did not apply because she was the actual or beneficial owner.

<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 5</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>38. No court decisions have been found which state that the LTB does not have jurisdiction to determine claims of equitable ownership. The Defendants submit that a distinction must be drawn between the jurisdiction to determine equitable ownership and the jurisdiction to grant equitable relief. In <CASEREF><SOC>Kaiman v. Graham</SOC></CASEREF>, cited by Thorburn J. in her reasons dismissing Warriach's appeal, the Court of Appeal clearly stated that the LTB did not have the power to grant the <UNDER>equitable remedies</UNDER> claimed by the plaintiffs. The court held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action on that basis and on the ground that the monetary amount claimed by the plaintiffs exceeded the LTB's monetary jurisdiction. The court also held that the plaintiffs were precluded from asserting that the LTB had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter as that issue was raised for the first time on appeal. At no time did the court state that the LTB does not have jurisdiction to determine equitable ownership rights.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Kaiman v. Graham</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 77</CITE><PARANUM>13&ndash;16 and 18-19</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 6</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>39. The power of the LTB to grant remedies is limited to those expressly provided for in the Act. The Defendants submit that there is no inconsistency or conflict between the power of the LTB to determine the existence of an equitable interest in property and its lack of authority to grant relief if such an interest is proven. If an equitable interest is in fact made out, the LTB loses jurisdiction because the named tenant claiming such an interest is in fact not a &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act. If, on the other hand, the LTB concludes that the named tenant is not an owner, which the Defendants assert necessarily involves determination of both legal and equitable ownership claims, and that person otherwise fits the definition of tenant, then the LTB has jurisdiction to decide the matter and grant the remedies provided for in the Act.</P1>
<P1>40. Thus, it is only where a named tenant is found to have ownership rights, legal or equitable, that the LTB loses its jurisdiction. It cannot, in those circumstances, proceed to grant remedies consequent on such a finding. The appropriate forum for those claims is the Superior Court once the existence of such an ownership interest has been proven. But that interest was found not to exist by the LTB acting within the jurisdiction and authority expressly granted to it by the legislature. As stated by the majority in <EM>Penner</EM>, that conclusion should be respected by the court.</P1>
<P1>41. Accordingly, the Defendants submit that all three preconditions for the application of issue estoppel are met in this case. The Defendants therefore submit that this Court should not hear any evidence or argument regarding the issues considered and determined by Member Solomon. Member Solomon concluded that Choudhry and Warriach were in fact in a landlord and tenant relationship and that the monthly payments made by Warriach were rent. She also determined that Warriach had no ownership interest in the Property. Warriach should not be permitted a &ldquo;second kick at the can&rdquo; in this trial in order to avoid the consequences of the LTB's conclusions. The Defendants further submit that the application of issue estoppel in this case would not work an injustice on the Plaintiff.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>Special Circumstances</TI>
<P><P1>42. As stated, all of the available evidence regarding the ownership issue was put before Member Solomon. Warriach does not intend to call any witnesses other than those who testified on his behalf before the LTB. If, however, Warriach argues that further evidence exists that was not put before Member Solomon, the Defendants submit that this is not a sufficient reason to refuse to apply issue estoppel. First, doing so would offend the principle of finality and would be a waste of judicial resources. This point was made the federal Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>39</BOLD> Pfizer also argues that letting this application proceed will not waste judicial resources. In particular, Pfizer submits that &ldquo;[t]here can be no waste of judicial resources in allowing the Court to assess, for the first time, Pfizer's case in respect of sildenafil's utility&rdquo; which was previously &ldquo;determined by the absence of any evidence.&rdquo;</P>
<P><BOLD>40</BOLD> The law is clear that litigants who have already litigated a matter but were unsuccessful are not to be permitted to relitigate because they have evidence that was previously omitted through negligence, inadvertence, or even accident. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2008 FC 674</CITE><PARANUM>39-40</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2008 FCA 263</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 7</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>43. Secondly, a lack of diligence on the part of Warriach or his counsel in presenting all of his evidence at the LTB hearings is not a special circumstance barring the application of issue estoppel. This principle was considered by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Ernst and Young Inc. v. Central Guaranty Trust Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, where the court stated:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>42</BOLD> The special circumstances exception bars the application of issue estoppel in a second proceeding. In order to demonstrate special circumstances, a party must show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in the first proceeding. The standard of reasonable diligence is an objective standard: <EM>Res Judicata</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 232&ndash;234.</P>
<P><BOLD>43</BOLD> The special circumstances exception is not applicable &ldquo;when all the relevant facts were known to the applicant's solicitor and he, for reasons unknown, did not advance them in argument&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Bernier v. Bernier</SOC><YEAR>1989</YEAR><CITE>62 D.L.R. (4th) 561</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>70 O.R. (2d) 372</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 13. Nor is it applicable simply because the court that made the decision in the first proceeding may have reached a wrong conclusion: <CASEREF><SOC>Hennig v. Northern Heights (Sault) Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1980</YEAR><CITE>116 D.L.R. (3d) 496</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>30 O.R. (2d) 346</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 33&ndash;36, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 346n.</P>
<P><BOLD>44</BOLD> The types of circumstances that have been held to constitute special circumstances include allegations that the decision in the first proceeding was obtained by fraud, the discovery of new evidence which could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence in the first proceeding, changes in the law, public policy considerations and circumstances amounting to a denial of natural justice: <EM>Res Judicata</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 231 and 280&ndash;282. Special circumstances do not exist when the litigant knew of the issue in the first proceedings and did not raise it. Therefore, there were no such circumstances in this case.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Ernst and Young Inc. v. Central Guaranty Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 377</CITE><PARANUM>42&ndash;44</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Defendants&mdash;Tab 8</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>44. Thus, any argument that additional evidence on the issue of equitable ownership will be advanced at the trial of this action but which could have been advanced before the LTB with the exercise of due diligence, or which was omitted through negligence, inadvertence or mistake, should not act as a bar to the application of issue estoppel. Warriach understood that this issue was at play in the LTB proceedings and any further evidence he may have should have been tendered there. Warriach should not be allowed to resile from failing or choosing not to do so.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>F.</N><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P><P1>45. The Defendants therefore submit that Warriach is precluded from re-litigating the issue of equitable ownership, and Member Solomon's other findings of fact and conclusions of law, on the basis of issue estoppel. The three preconditions have been met in this case and there is no basis to conclude that issue estoppel should not be applied because it would cause real injustice. Furthermore, there are no special circumstances that would operate to bar the application of the doctrine. Warriach had every opportunity to prove an ownership interest in the Property before the LTB but failed to do so. Member Solomon found that no such interest existed. That decision, the Defendants submit, should be respected.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>46. The Defendants therefore respectfully request an order:
<P2>(a) declaring that the monthly amounts paid by the Plaintiff from March 2012 onwards constituted rent and not carrying costs of the Property, or additional expenses of the Property, as found by the LTB;</P2>
<P2>(b) declaring that the Plaintiff is estopped from raising, arguing or presenting any evidence on the issues of the landlord and tenant relationship and the nature of the monthly payments made by the Plaintiff;</P2>
<P2>(c) declaring that the $62,000 payment made by the Plaintiff did not constitute part of the acquisition costs of the Property, as found by the LTB;</P2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The central issue between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the Superior Court of Justice is the determination of the equitable rights of the Plaintiff in [location omitted](the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;). Only the Superior Court of Justice can make that determination based on relevant and probative evidence adduced under oath. For that very reason, the Plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Superior Court, on November 1, 2016.</P>
<P>2. On November 7, 2016, the Defendant on the one hand defended the Claim, but on the other hand, and at the same time commenced parallel applications under the Residential Tenancy Act (&ldquo;Act&rdquo;) in the Landlord Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) for eviction of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>3. Armed with a residential tenancy agreement that was obtained on fraudulent misrepresentation by the Defendant and his brother, the aim of the Defendant, throughout has been obtaining a determination of the Property rights of the litigants through the administrative tribunal, the Landlord and Tenant Board.</P>
<P>4. In January 2017, the Defendant also made a motion in the Superior Court for the same relief that they had claimed in the LTB application. In his submissions before the LTB Member, on December 7, 2016, the Plaintiff's counsel termed the Superior Court Motion as a &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo; measure.</P>
<P>5. Having failed to evict the Tenant and his family through the LTB proceedings, the Defendants now wish to use the determination of the administrative tribunal, under the Act, that for expeditious resolution of petty rent disputes uses a rough and ready procedure so that the Plaintiff is deprived of its substantive rights before the Superior Court.</P>
<P>6. The Divisional Court, although it did not allow the appeals of the Plaintiff, (as Appeal of the LTB decision only He on questions of law alone) made it amply clear that the nature of the proceedings and the questions at issue in the Superior Court and the Landlord and Tenant board are clearly different and distinct.</P>
<P>7. The Divisional Court held that the Superior Court of Justice is not bound by the decisions of the Landlord Tenant Board and the LTB has no jurisdiction to adjudicate property rights in Ontario. The Lawyer for the LTB had the same position on during Appeal.</P>
<P>8. The decisions of the Divisional Court were not appealed by the Defendant and have attained finality. The Defendant has brought this motion in the face of the orders of the Divisional Court.</P>
<P>9. Through this motion, the Defendant has also attempted to oust the jurisdiction of the Superior court of Justice to decide the Property disputes of the Litigants in Ontario. That determination will have far reaching implication for the whole province. The Defendants has attempted unset tle or change the trite law that the ownership rights of real property in Ontario can only be decided by the Superior Court of Justice.</P>
<P>10. This is also an attempt to cause injustice by depriving the Plaintiff of his asserted right of over $200,000.00 in the Property through the unjust use of issue estoppel. Notwithstanding the clear dictum of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Danyluk</EM> at paragraph 1 that, &ldquo; ...A judicial doctrine developed to serve the ends of justice should not be applied mechanically to work an injustice&rdquo; The application of the issue estoppel before the trial of this action would result in an injustice and would render the trial meaningless.</P>
<P>11. The Superior Courts of Justice retains the discretion, as established by the jurisprudence and decision of the Supreme Court of Canada whereby, even if, issue estoppel , was established it ought not be applied where its application would result in injustice.</P>
<P>12. The Defendants by bringing this motion has added unnecessary steps and costs to the litigation, and specially on the eve of the trial which motion if granted would make the trail meaningless.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>13. The Plaintiff, Sarfraz Warraich (&ldquo;Sarfraz&rdquo;) pursuant to a verbal agreement in March 2012, paid the sum of $62,000.00 to the Defendant, Aftab Choudhry (&ldquo;Aftab&rdquo;) as acquisition costs for a 50% ownership interest in [location omitted](the&ldquo; Property&rdquo;). The Plaintiff also paid the half of the carrying costs of the Property from 2012 to date.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit A the Affidavit of Sarfraz Warraich dated November 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Sarfraz Affidavit&rdquo;), at paragraph (&ldquo;para&rdquo;) 4;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. As an owner, and acting on the verbal agreement, Sarfraz utilized the services of LEMCAD consultants and paid $20,000.00 to LEMCAD for permits, and costs related to the Committee of Adjustments;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit B to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 6</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. In April/May 2016, parties negotiated to separate their ownership interests.</P>
<P>16. Parties were unable to agree on the evaluations, cost and their respective share in the Property. Parties, with the help of mutual friends reached an Agreement and executed that agreement in the presence of an arm's length third party on September 02, 2016. Aftab paid a sum of $20,000.00 for as deposit for faithful performance of the Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit C to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 11</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit D to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Aftab reneged on the written Agreement of September 2, 2016 and refused to sign the documents that were sent to his lawyer wherein he would grant a mortgage in the sum of $204,500 to Sarfraz for the ownership share of Sarfraz in the Property. Aftab paid Sarfraz the sum of $20,000.00 as deposit for faithful performance of that agreement.
<P1><BOLD><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit E to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 12</BOLD></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Sarfraz instructed his lawyer to put a Caution on the Property;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit F to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 13</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. On November 1, 2016, the Plaintiff commenced a Statement of Claim in the Superior Court based on his equitable rights in the Property.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit G to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. In the Defence and Counterclaim dated November 7, 2016, the Defendant claimed an alleged Tenancy that commenced <UNDER>in March 2013,</UNDER> where the Defendant was the Landlord and Sarfraz was the Tenant.;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit H to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The Defendant concurrently commenced two application in Landlord Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) in November 2016, for eviction, one based on non-payment of rent and the other, that he wants to demolish the Property. In both the applications, Aftab claimed that he alleged tenancy commenced <UNDER>on March 2013;</UNDER>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit I to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The hearing of LTB for eviction of Sarfraz on the L-1 application of the Defendant took place on December 7, 2016 without the participation of Sarfraz or his lawyer. Sarfraz could not attend due to a doctor's appointment and his lawyer was out of country due to a family emergency.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit J to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. A paralegal attended on behalf of Sarfraz and requested for an adjournment, which was opposed by the Defendant's counsel. The LTB Member, despite being advised of the proceedings before the Superior court, refused to grant an adjournment, and assumed that the non-attendance of the Plaintiff, was deliberate, when in fact, he had a doctor's appointment, the same very day.</P>
<P>24. Only the Defendant gave evidence and the lawyer for the Defendant made arguments. On December 7, 2016 the Defendant deposed under oath at the hearing of the Landlord Tenant Board (&ldquo;LTB&rdquo;) that the Plaintiff, Sarfraz had lived at the Property pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement since March 1, 2013. The submissions of the Defendant's lawyer were factually incorrect.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit K to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. The Member was influenced by the one sided submissions of the Defendant's lawyer, and before adducing any evidence on page 14 of the transcripts declared that she sees a lot of evidence to the Landlord and none to the Tenant. The actual evidence was adduced on page 32 of the transcripts.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit L to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 21</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. The residential tenancy agreement, and text messages between the Plaintiff and Defendant were produced at the hearing. The Defendant deposed that the tenancy commenced on March 1, 2013. The text messages that were only disclosed at the time of the testimony.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit M to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. The procedure at the hearing was rough and ready only suitable for petty disputes of rents between Landlords and tenants. The Defendant suppressed the information that Sarfraz and his family has lived at the Property since April 2012, Sarfraz has lived in the Property since April 2012 along with his family pursuant to the verbal agreement. The text messages, over the objections of Mr. Bush, were only disclosed at the time of testimony. The Member declared there were no specific rules for disclosure.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit N to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 23</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. The Member ordered the eviction of Sarfraz for non-payment of rent.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit O to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 24</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. Sarfraz has lived in the Property since April 2012 along with his family pursuant to the verbal agreement, which information was not disclosed to the Member LTB.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit P to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 25</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. The Defendant in his sworn affidavit for the Defendant's motion in Superior Court of Justice returnable January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, swore that the alleged tenancy commenced on March 2013;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit Q to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 26</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. On January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, Justice Matheson ordered the Plaintiff to remain in possession and order payment of $2,000.00 per month, without prejudice to the rights of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has fully complied with the orders of Justice Matheson;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit R to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 27</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>MATERIAL FACT OF SARFRAZ LIVING AT THE PROPERTY SINCE 2012 ONLY DISCLOSED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION</TI>
<P>32. Only on April 5, 2017, long after having obtained an order for eviction, while suppressing probative evidence, and only during cross-examination on the L-2 Application for demolition did the Defendant, Aftab admit that in fact Sarfraz had resided at the Property since April 2012, without a residential tenancy Agreement;
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo; to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 28</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. Despite the offer of the Plaintiff to pursue the matter in the Superior Court only, the Defendants insisted on pursuing the matter before two forums and continued with the L-2 Application before the same Member of the LTB, as they knew she would no go against her earlier decison where she had ordered eviction almost ex-parte.</P>
<P>34. Despite the protest of the Plaintiff, and the raising of the issue of Bias, and a request to recuse herself, the same Member continued to hear the 2nd Application stated she had assumed jurisdiction.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo; to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 30</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. On the L-2 application the Member reached the same decision and ordered my eviction.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo; to Sarfraz Affidavit at para 31</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. In her final order, the Member made factual errors during the evaluation of the evidence on the L-2 application. In her order, at paragraph 15, of her order on the L-2 application she declared Ishfaq Choudhry (&ldquo;IC&rdquo;) to be the brother of the Plaintiff when in fact, Ishfaq Choudhry is the brother of the Defendant.</P>
<P>37. In paragraph 25, of her order on the L-2 application the Member stated that the email admitting receipt of $15,000 was from the Tenant to the Landlord. In fact, the email was sent by the alleged landlord, Aftab to Sarfraz, wherein, the Aftab admitted through his own email that he had received $15,000.00 from Sarfraz towards the down payment of [location omitted]</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><TI>THE TEST FOR ISSUE ESTOPPEL</TI>
<P>The Supreme Court of Canada in Danyluk quoted with approval the test for Resjudicata at Paragraph 53, as enunciated by Dickson J in <CASEREF><SOC>Angle v. Minister of National Revenue</SOC><CITE>[1975] 2 S.C.R. 248</CITE><PAGENUM>at 254</PAGENUM></CASEREF>):
<QUOTE><P><P1>(1) that the same question has been decided;</P1>
<P1>(2) that the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and,</P1>
<P1>(3) that the parries to the judicial decision or their privies werethe same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised, or their privies....</P1></P>
<P>Modifications were necessary because of the &ldquo;major differences that can exist between [administrative orders and court orders] in relation, <EM>inter alia</EM>, to their legal nature and the position within the state structure of the institutions that issue them&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v.

<BLOCK4><N>(1)</N><TI>that the same question has been decided;</TI>
<P>39. The Plaintiff states that the nature of the questions before the two tribunals are fundamentally different. The Plaintiff's claim in the Superior Court of Justice is on equitable rights of the Plaintiff in the Property. The Defendant claimed the right as a landlord under the Residential Tenancy Act (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). The adjudication of these rights requires different criteria, and jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the two tribunals who had to adjudicate these rights is mutually exclusive.</P>
<P>40. The central issue, therefore, in this case is the determination of equitable rights of ownership in the real property [location omitted]. The Landlord Tenant Board does not have the jurisdiction to determine those rights. Any finding made by LTB, without jurisdiction cannot and ought not to impair the rights of litigations and encroach on the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. The Divisional Court has been clear and unequivocal in its determinat ion that it is only the Superior Court that can determine the equitable rights of the litigants.</P>
<P>41. This single point settles this motion and the motion ought to be dismissed.</P>
<P>42. As <BOLD><EM>Danyluk</EM></BOLD> critically noted in paragraph 36:
<QUOTE><P>The prior decision judicial, arbitral, or administrative, must have been made within jurisdiction before it can give rise to <EM>res judicata</EM>estoppels.</P>
<P>(&ldquo;Res Judicata: General Principles and Recent Developments&rdquo; (1999), 18 <EM>Aust. Bar Rev</EM> 214 at p. 215)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Plaintiff TAB 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. As clarified by the Divisional Court in its decision on the L-1 application, in <CASEREF><SOC>Warraich v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1275</CITE></CASEREF>, the court held that the two issues before the LTB and the Superior court were entirely different issues in two different proceedings. The Court further clarified that the matter ends there, as the LTB cannot adjudicate the equitable rights of the appellant. At paragraph 16, 17, and 20 the court held:
<QUOTE><P>[16] There are two very different legal proceedings occurring in two different tribunals&mdash;the landlord's eviction proceeding before the Board and the appellant's claim of ownership in the Superior Court action. <UNDER>The Board has the jurisdiction to hear the eviction application</UNDER> <UNDER>which is based on the Lease</UNDER>. Indeed, it has the sole jurisdiction to terminate a tenancy and evict a tenant: see <CASEREF><SOC>Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Hosein</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 628</CITE></CASEREF>. The Board's jurisdiction in this regard extends to the determination of whether the appellant is a &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;, and the respondent is a &ldquo;landlord&rdquo;, as defined in s. 2(1) of the Act. Conversely, the Superior Court has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim of an equitable ownership interest in the property.</P>
<P>The Divisional court firmly settled the question that the determination of the party's rights under the Act are not determinative of their rights before the Superior Court of f Justice.</P>
<P>[17] These are very separate proceedings that can proceed without any risk of conflicting decisions. In particular, a finding that the appellant is a lessee under the Lease does not in any way affect, much less determine, his claim that he has an equitable interest in the property as a co-owner.</P>
<P>[20] ......The nature of the appellant's claim, and any view of the merits of that claim, are matters that are beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Warraich v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1275</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;BOA of the Plaintiff TAB 6</BOLD></P1>

<P>44. On the L-2 application, (for the demolition of the Property) the Divisional Court considered the decision of the LTB, where evidence had been considered by the not legally trained LTB Member. The court in decision <CASEREF><SOC>Warraich v. Choudhry</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1275</CITE></CASEREF> was clear and on this point. The Divisional court held as follows;
<QUOTE><P>[39] The decision of an expert tribunal interpreting the provisions of its home statute is ent itled to deference. However, the rights of landlords and tenants are restricted by statute, and there is no recourse to the equitable jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. (<CASEREF><SOC>Metro Housing Corp v. Ganitano</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 10</CITE></CASEREF>).</P>
<P>[41] If the Board could consider only legal title, it is clear t hat the Appellant had no legal tide to the property. If the Board made a determination that the Appellant had no legal or equitable ownership interest, the Board decided that it was not satisfied on the evidence before it that there was any ownership interest. Moreover, the Board made it clear that its determination that the <UNDER>Appellant was not a &ldquo;co-owner&rdquo; was made only for the purpose of determining whether the Appellant was a &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; within the meaning of section 2 of the Act, not to address any rights or obligations flowing from an ownership interest.</UNDER></P>
<P>[42] The Board's decision was therefore reasonable even if it erred in also taking into acco unt indicia of equitable ownership in reaching its decision that the Appellant was not a co-owner.</P>
<P>[45] However, where the <EM>Residential Tenancies Act</EM> applies, and the Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear other matters involving the same parties and same property, there is no exclusive jurisdiction of the Landlord and Tenant Board. (<CASEREF><SOC>Kaiman v. Graham</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 77</CITE></CASEREF> per Weiler J.A.)</P>
<P><BOLD>BOA of the Plaintiff TAB 2</BOLD></P>
<P>[48] In <EM>Kaiman</EM>, the same parties litigated issues in respect of the same property: one before the Board and the other before the Court but the issues being adjudicated were different. That situation was the same as the situation in this case.</P>
<P>[49] The only issue before this Board was whether the Appellant was a tenant. In addressing that issue, the Board had to address the issue of co-ownership <UNDER>but only to establish that the Appellant was a tenant</UNDER>. The issue was not what equitable interest, if any, the Appellant had in the property, as the Board has no jurisdiction to determine equitable rights and entitlements. By contrast, the issue before the Superior Court is whether the Appellant has an equitable interest in the property and if so, what compensation he should receive.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>45. The Defendant/Moving did not raise any issue on the findings of the Divisional court. That finding, and the decision of the Divisional court, has attained finality and cannot be attacked collaterally through this motion.</P>
<P>46. At paragraph 50 the court held:
<QUOTE><P>[50] The two proceedings therefore involve the adjudication of separate and distinct interests in the property.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS</TI>
<P>[53] The legislature provides that the Board has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a person is a tenant and if so, to terminate the tenancy and/or evict the tenant. The Act provides that the Board must determine whether a tenant has the right to occupy the premises. A person who occupies the premises as co-owner is not a tenant. Since the Board has no equitable jurisdiction, it may only consider legal ownership (absent a determination by the Superior Court).</P>
<P>[57] Since the Board has no jurisdiction to determine equitable ownership rights and entidements, the Appellant will not be prejudiced by the Board's decision in the litigation of those issues in the Superior Court, as the Board's findings on the issue of co-ownership are not binding on the Superior Court. They involve different issues and the findings were made solely for the purpose of determining that the Appellant was a tenant within the</P>
<P>47. The above holding leaves no room for ambiguity. As the interests in the two proceedings are difference, the determination of one interest, i.e. the status of the Plaintiff as a tenant under the Act, cannot be determinative of the interests that are before the Superior court of Justice.</P>
<P>48. The Divisional court, clearly settled the question that is being relitigated through this motion in the favour of the Plaintiff by holding as follows;</P>
<P>THE JUDICIAL DECISION THAT CREATED ISSUE ESTOPPEL WAS FINAL</P>
<P>49. The Plaintiff, agrees that the decision of the LTB within its jurisdiction as prescribed by its statutory mandate, was final</P>
<P>THE PARTIES AND THE PRIVIES ARE NOT THE SAME</P>
<P>50. The title of the Property, [location omitted]is registered in the name of Aftab Choudhry and Nuzhat Yasmin. Yasmine has 50% of registered ownership in the Property.</P>
<P>51. The Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff for a determination of his property rights is against two defendants, Aftab and his wife Nuzhat.</P>
<P>52. The alleged Tenancy Agreement is only executed by one registered owner, being Aftab Choudhry. It is not executed by the co-owner Nuzhat, and neither was Nuzhat before the LTB. She never testified or gave evidence.</P>
<P>53. The applications for eviction and demolition were commenced by Aftab Choudhry only. Nuzhat Yasmin, who is a co-owner of the Property was not before the LTB and therefore, this requirement has not been met or fulfilled. Therefore, the parties, who's rights are to be determined by the Superior Court, the party that asserted the status of a Landlord based on the residential tenancy Agreement are not the same.</P>
<P>54. Nuzhat Yasmin is a stranger to proceedings before the Landlord Tenant Board, and therefore being a party to the Action in the Superior Court, which predates the Board proceedings cannot assert issue estoppel, where, she was not a party to the previous proceedings as noted in paragraph 59 of Danyluk;</P>

<BLOCK3><TI>DISCRETION OF THE COURT EVEN IF ISSUE ESTOPPEL IS ESTABLISHED.</TI>
<P>55. The Supreme Court of Canada in Danyluk has proscribed the mechanical application of the doctrine of Issue Estoppel, if it would result in injustice. The court noted in paragraph 63</P>
<P>In <EM>Bugbusters</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, Finch J.A. (now C.J.B.C.) observed, at para. 32: It must always be remembered that although the three requirements for issue estoppel must be satisfied before it can apply, th e fact that they may be satisfied does not automatically give rise to its application. Issue estoppel is an equitable doctrine, and as can be seen from the cases, is closely related to abuse of process. The doctrine of issue estoppel is designed as an impl ement of justice, and a protection against injustice. It inevitably calls upon the exercise of a judicial discretion to achieve fairness according to the circumstances of each case.
<P1><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Plaintiff TAB 3</BOLD></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>Some of the factors considered by the Supreme Court in Danyluk, for the exercise of the discretions are as follows;</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK4><N>(a)</N><TI>PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATAION</TI>
<P>The Residential Tenancies Act is for expeditious disposition of the rent dispute between Landlord and Tenant;</P>
<P>56. The LTB receives over 80,000 applications a year. The general approach of the LTB is informed by section 183 of the <EM>RTA</EM> which directs the LTB to adopt the most expeditious method of determining the questions arising in a proceeding that affords to all parties directly affected by the proceeding an adequate opportunity to know the issues and be heard on the matter.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Purpose of Residential Tenancy Act Schedule B</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario, 2013-2014 Annual Report, pages 34-35, LTB Schedule B</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. The, quick and expeditious procedures suitable to accomplish the objectives of the Act are simply inadequate to deal with complex issues of fact or law. The LTB as administrative body is a master of its own procedures, however has no expertise in deciding complex issues of fact and law.</P>
<P>58. Its inability to make correct determination of fact or evaluation of the evidence in complex matters has been made clear by the patent errors in appreciation of the evidence as the Member relied on its own patently wrong finds of fact. The Member has also excluded or disregarded evidence the court may consider probative and has acted on evidence the court may consider less than reliable. Because of all of the above, this is critical factor in the exercise of the court's discretion.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI>Focus of Administrative Proceedings&mdash;and Focus of Litigation before the Court</TI>
<P>59. The focus of the LTB was entirely different from the present litigation in the Superior Court. The proceedings in the LTB were for the recovery of rent or eviction in lieu thereof. The Plaintiff had stopped payments because parties had disagreement during the separation of their respective ownership interest. The rent claimed was about $ 10,000.00 and utilities. The Plaintiff equitable ownership rights are in excess of $200,000.00</P>
<P>60. The Focus of the Superior Court Litigation is the determination of the Property rights and whether or not the Plaintiff is entitled to over $200,000.00 as his share of the Property. These are substantial rights, and to deprive the Plaintiff to assert or prove those rights would indeed be miscarriage of justice.</P>
<P>61. In Bugbusters, the crown's subsequent litigation for recovery of $ Million dollars was allowed to proceed despite that the crown had paid expenses under the Forestry Act R.S.B.C There, as here, it was not within the reasonable expectation of the Plaintiff that his Property Rights will be denied based on the decision of an administrative tribunal. The decision is quoted with approval in paragraph 71 of Danyluk.</P>

<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI>The Expertise of the Administrative Decision Maker</TI>
<P>62. The LTB member was a non-legally trained individual, who was faced with making decisions concerning the complex questions related to contract law and the resultant rights of the parties to an equitable share in the Property.</P>
<P>63. The order of eviction in passed by the Tribunal for nonpayment in undue haste, on the testimony of the Defendant and arguments of his counsel, without the participation of the counsel for the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff is a factor that ought to be s in the respondent's favour for the exercise of judicial discretion. Having made a decision o nce, the Member stuck to her stance and made the reached the same conclusion on the second application.</P>
<P>64. The rough and ready approach normally suited to non-paying tenants, involving relatively small sums of moneys on account of monthly rent, was not appropriate or suitable to the complex issues that involve the determination of the rights of the parties involving property rights in Ontario.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Consolidated Maybrun Mines Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 706</CITE><PARANUM>50</PARANUM></CASEREF></P>
<P>(d) Only the counsel for the Defendant made submissions which were factually incorrect. On page 8 of the transcripts, he advised the court that there was Certificate of Pending litigation on the property, when there has been none ever. On page 9 of the transcripts, Mr. Zweig advised that the Motion that he had brought before the Superior Court returnable January 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 was in his words, &ldquo; a failsafe measure&rdquo;) and on page 13 of the transcripts he advised that there was a lot of prejudice to his clients;</P>
<P>(e) The Member in turn, without hearing any evidence, made up her mind and declared on page 14 that she sees lots of prejudice to the Landlord and none to the Tenant. The actual evidence of Defendant only begins on page 30 of the transcripts. Mr. Bush was unable to speak to his client as he was in the hospital but he was unable to do so.

<P>(f) The text messages that were relied upon for the decision of the LTB Member were shown only just before the testimony and were not disclosed beforehand to Mr. Bush. The Member declared there is a summary procedure for disclosure . So long that one party brings three copies and gives it to the other side.
