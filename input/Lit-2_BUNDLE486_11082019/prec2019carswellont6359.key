<BLOCK1><TI>CLAIM</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff's claim is for:
<P1>(a) damages for breach of the duty of fairness, breach of the duty to act in good faith, breach of contract and/or breach of fiduciary duty in an amount to be specified;</P1>
<P1>(b) aggravated damages in an amount to be specified</P1>
<P1>(c) punitive damages in an amount to be specified;</P1>
<P1>(d) pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest pursuant to sections 128 and 129, respectively, of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43, as amended;</P1>
<P1>(e) the costs of these proceedings on a substantial indemnity basis; and</P1>
<P1>(f) such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, Vivian Bercovici, is an individual currently residing in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Plaintiff is the former Ambassador of Canada to Israel. The Plaintiff held the position of Canada's Ambassador to Israel from on or about February 14, 2014 to June 30, 2016.</P>
<P>3. By Order in Council, the Plaintiff became a public servant effective on or about January 2, 2014 at the invitation of the Government of Canada. The Plaintiff was appointed to the position of Ambassador to Israel for a four-year term with an opportunity to extend the term.</P>
<P>4. On or about April 21, 2016, the Plaintiff was advised that her appointment would be terminated. The Plaintiff eventually learned that the effective date of the termination would be June 30, 2016.</P>
<P>5. During the period April 21 to June 30, 2016, the Plaintiff made substantial efforts to address numerous pressing issues arising from the termination of her appointment. The responsible officials rebuffed and ignored her, advising her that the Government of Canada could do whatever it wanted to her.</P>
<P>6. The Defendant was required to deal with the Plaintiff honourably, fairly, in good faith and not capriciously.</P>
<P>7. When appointing the Plaintiff to the position of Ambassador to Israel and thereafter, the Defendant gave her assurances about her appointment and tenure that reasonably and legitimately led the Plaintiff to expect that her appointment would only be terminated in good faith and according to a fair process. However, the Defendant ultimately terminated her appointment in a harsh and vindictive manner that had the purpose and effect of harming the Plaintiff. The Defendant's conduct was in bad faith, violated the duty of fairness owed to the Plaintiff, and was contrary to the Plaintiff's legitimate expectations.</P>
<P>8. During the Plaintiff's tenure as Ambassador, she served as a public servant according to terms that were contractual in nature. In the course of terminating her appointment, the Defendant engaged in breach of contract.</P>
<P>9. Given the unique nature of the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Government of Canada, the Defendant was under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Plaintiff, which the Defendant violated through its conduct.</P>
<P>10. As a result, the Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff for the relief set out in paragraph 1 above.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI>The Parties</TI>
<P>7. The Plaintiff, Ms. Vivian Bercovici (&ldquo;the Plaintiff&rdquo;), is the former Canadian Ambassador to Israel. She was appointed to her position by the Prime Minister, and served at the pleasure of the Prime Minister. She is 56 (fifty-six) years of age. She currently resides in the City of Tel Aviv, in the country of Israel. She is an entrepreneur, freelance writer and the sole income earner for her and her daughter, who resides with her.</P>
<P>8. The organizational Defendant, the Attorney General, is a Ministry of the Federal Government, and carries out its functions as a government entity on behalf of the Crown.</P>
<P>9. The individual Defendant, Mr. Gwozdecky, was Director General, Middle East and Maghreb until November, 2015, when he was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister, International Security and Political Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>10. The individual Defendant, Mr. Jean, now retired, was at all material times the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and, subsequently as of May 16, 2016, the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada.</P>
<P>11. The individual Defendant, Ms. Bugailiskis, is currently the Canadian Ambassador to Italy, San Marino, Albania and High Commissioner to Malta. However, formerly, and at all material times, she was the Assistant Deputy Minister of Europe, the Middle East and Maghreb and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>12. The individual Defendant, Ms. Richardson, is the Canadian Ambassador to the Czech Republic. However, formerly, and at all material times, she was the Inspector General for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>13. The individual Defendant, Ms. Telford, is currently, and was at all material times, the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Appointment as Canadian Ambassador to Israel</TI>
<P>14. In January, 2014, the Plaintiff was appointed as the Canadian Ambassador to Israel by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Her appointment was effective January 2, 2014. The term was for 4 (four) years, at an annual compensation of $180,000 in addition to a bonus, with an opportunity for an extension of the term of the appointment.</P>
<P>15. On January 4, 2014, the Plaintiff's appointment was publicly announced by John Baird, the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time.</P>
<P>16. The Plaintiff is Jewish and a supporter of Israel. Unlike many Ambassadors, she was not a career diplomat at the time of her Appointment. She was honoured to receive this Appointment and was eager to begin work serving Canada as Ambassador to Israel, and working to build stronger ties between Canada and Israel.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Special and Unique Relationship of Ambassador to Canada / Fiduciary Relationship</TI>
<P>17. The role of an Ambassador is a special, distinctive role that holds the unique status as one of the highest diplomatic ranks in the public service. Ambassadors move their families and live where they work, sometimes in politically unstable and dangerous regions. It is an Ambassador's duty to represent his or her Government in the country where he or she is deployed. There exists an inherent special relationship of trust and reliance between an Ambassador and his or her Government, given an Ambassador's special representative mandate.</P>
<P>18. The Plaintiff pleads that while she was appointed by the Prime Minister and served at his pleasure, she was told by Senior Department officials before her deployment, and many times subsequently, that she was to report to them. You are &ldquo;<EM>one of us</EM>&rdquo;, she was told.</P>
<P>19. The Plaintiff reported directly to Mr. Gwozdecky, who reported in turn to Assistant Deputy Minister Daniel Costello (&ldquo;Mr. Constello&rdquo;), who, in turn, reported to Mr. Jean.</P>
<P>20. The Plaintiff was deployed to Israel on January 7, 2014 to commence her appointment, and had every expectation that she would be supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs (&ldquo;the Department&rdquo;) in the execution of her mandate.</P>
<P>21. However, not only was she unsupported in her role, but the individual named Defendants, as well as countless others within the Public Service, intentionally and maliciously waged a campaign of abuse against the Plaintiff designed to malign, undermine and destroy her credibility in that role, such that by the time of her dismissal, she had become a mere pawn, stripped of authority and ability to do anything more than obey, and accept abusive treatment as the status quo.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Bad Faith Pre-Termination Behaviour</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><N>(1)</N><TI>Abuse and Harassment by the Public Service</TI>
<P>22. From the outset of her appointment, it became abundantly clear that key individuals in the Public Service within the Department were actively working to undermine the Plaintiff, question her competency, loyalty, professionalism and create such a hostile work environment for her that she was left with a seriously compromised ability to perform the key functions of her Ambassadorial role.</P>
<P>23. Director General Mark Gwozdecky (&ldquo;Mr. Gwozdecky&rdquo;) of the Department of Foreign Affairs made it known from the commencement of the Plaintiff's appointment that he had little to no confidence in the Plaintiff's ability to perform the role of Ambassador.</P>
<P>24. Mr. Gwozdecky's harassing, demeaning, belittling and hostile treatment towards the Plaintiff commenced even before the Plaintiff was deployed to Israel to commence her term as Ambassador.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI>Openly Sidelining and Questioning the Plaintiff's Competency during the Prime Minister's Official Visit to Israel in January, 2014</TI>
<P>25. One of the Plaintiff's first tasks was to facilitate the Prime Minister of Canada's visit to Israel in January 2014, a significant diplomatic event for both Canada and Israel. Mr. Gwozdecky, however, openly questioned the Plaintiff's ability and competency to represent Canada during this visit.</P>
<P>26. In that regard, the Plaintiff pleads that Mr. Gwozdecky commented that the Prime Minister's visit was &ldquo;<EM>too much</EM>&rdquo; for the Plaintiff to handle, and attempted to sideline her by positioning James Fox (&ldquo;Mr. Fox&rdquo;), the Charge d'Affaires in the Canadian Embassy in Israel at the time the Plaintiff was appointed, as the lead during this visit. He implored the Plaintiff to &ldquo;<EM>use her charm</EM>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<EM>convince</EM>&rdquo; Mr. Fox to remain in Israel so that he could do the &ldquo;<EM>lion's share</EM>&rdquo; of the official Ambassadorial work.</P>
<P>27. The Plaintiff pleads that not only was this a clear undermining of her professional duties, but also a complete departure from any previous head of state visits, as Mr. Fox was not the Canadian Ambassador, nor the Ambassador Designate, and accompanying the Prime Minister during his official visit to Israel was, by definition, one of her most significant responsibilities.</P>
<P>28. Notwithstanding that the Plaintiff was the Ambassador Designate, through his comments and actions, it became clear that Mr. Gwozdecky intended for the Plaintiff to stay in the background at the Embassy during the Prime Minister's visit, and for Mr. Fox to attend all the official meetings with the Prime Minister.</P>
<P>29. Fortunately, the Plaintiff addressed the matter with the Prime Minister's Office, which intervened to ensure the Plaintiff, not Mr. Fox, would be the individual representing Canada at all official meetings during the Prime Minister's visit. While this first situation was resolved, it also resulted in significant reprisal for the Plaintiff having thwarted Mr. Gwozdecky's efforts to sideline her.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI>Serious Concerns with Official Residence Rebuffed and Ignored</TI>
<P>30. Early on in her tenure as Ambassador, the Plaintiff raised serious concerns with respect to the Ambassador's Official Residence. As the Plaintiff was a single woman, and would have her teenage daughter residing with her in the Official Residence, such issues were of the utmost importance.</P>
<P>31. In response, Mr. Gwozdecky sent the Plaintiff an article about a former Canadian diplomat who had been disciplined as a result of raising concerns about an Official Residence. The Plaintiff immediately telephoned Mr. Gwozdecky for clarification, and he told her that he was &ldquo;<EM>concerned</EM>&rdquo; she may be making the same &ldquo;<EM>error</EM>&rdquo; and to &ldquo;<EM>be careful</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>32. The Plaintiff also tried to raise additional concerns with the Official Residence regarding both staffing and operational issues, but these, too, were met with the same resistance, warnings and threats from Mr. Gwozdecky. It was made abundantly clear to the Plaintiff that she was expected by Mr. Gwozdecky to keep her head down, and refrain from voicing any concerns.</P>
<P>33. The Plaintiff further pleads that even when she raised the issue of her daughter travelling alone to a war zone in summer 2014, her concerns were met with indifference. In that regard, war had broken out between Israel and Gaza, and the Plaintiff's daughter, who had been in Canada at that time, needed to travel to Israel, as she was due to start school in Mid-August.</P>
<P>34. However, the Plaintiff's request that the Department cover the cost of having her daughter's father or another adult accompany her on that trip, raising concerns about the security of her daughter, given that the war had recently broken out. The Plaintiff's request was flatly refused on the basis that if her daughter had been 16 years of age, the travel fare of an adult to accompany her would have been covered, but because she was 17, it would not, despite such exceptional circumstances.</P>
<P>35. The Plaintiff pleads that regardless of any policy, the Department had the discretion to cover the nominal travel costs of an adult to accompany her teenage daughter to Israel, and ought to have done so, as her daughter's need to travel safely was directly related to her role as Ambassador. However, when the Department chose not to, it revealed the lack of importance of the Plaintiff and illustrated another instance where the Plaintiff's very real security concerns, were given limited or no importance.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(c)</N><TI>Malicious Defamation</TI>
<P>36. From the outset of her appointment, the Plaintiff became aware of Government personnel posted in Tel Aviv, Ottawa, and elsewhere who were defaming her character. This defamation persisted throughout the entire duration of her appointment. Defamatory comments were made by Government personnel and Department personnel, directly to locally hired Israeli staff in the Canadian Embassy, to the media and to others. One example included, but was not limited to, Senior Trade Commissioner, Bonny Berger, who maliciously defamed the Plaintiff to Embassy staff, telling them that the Plaintiff was &ldquo;<EM>anti-Arab</EM>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>racist</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>37. Other defamatory comments about the Plaintiff were spread by Government personnel to the media, some of which were widely disseminated in the press.</P>
<P>38. Although the Plaintiff made complaints of this defamatory conduct to both Mr. Gwozdecky and Mr. Jean, neither Mr. Gwozdecky nor Mr. Jean took any action to stop or address the defamatory and toxic comments at the time.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(d)</N><TI>Stripped of Authority</TI>
<P>39. From the outset of her appointment, it became clear to the Plaintiff that Mr. Gwozdecky, Mr. Jean and Department personnel were actively working against the Plaintiff in order to undermine her, make her appear incompetent and strip her of her authority to make important decisions that were critical to her ability to do her job.</P>
<P>40. In the summer of 2014, when the Israel-Gaza war broke out, the Plaintiff had been on vacation in Canada. The Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time had directed that the Plaintiff immediately return to Israel, which the Plaintiff agreed to do, as it was a politically sensitive time. However, for inexplicable reasons, Mr. Gwozdecky told the Plaintiff it was unnecessary to return, placing the Plaintiff in an untenable situation having to choose between ignoring the Minister's Directive, or ignoring the directive of her direct report.</P>
<P>41. In another instance, the Plaintiff worked extremely hard to source a new property for the Canadian Embassy in Israel, even arranging a number of excellent opportunities for the Treasury Board to consider. However, the Department worked for 2 (two) years to thwart and sabotage every effort that she made in this respect. Finally, a senior official in the Department told her &ldquo;<EM>if you support this move, the Department will oppose it</EM>&rdquo;, making it abundantly clear she not only had staunch opposition, but no real authority.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(e)</N><TI>Scapegoating the Plaintiff Despite her Request for an Audit on the Previous Ambassador's Operational Management</TI>
<P>42. The Plaintiff had serious concerns about various operational irregularities that had persisted under the previous Canadian Ambassador to Israel, Paul Hunt (&ldquo;Mr. Hunt&rdquo;). The Plaintiff therefore made a request to the Department of Foreign Affairs that an inspection (an informal audit) of the Embassy be undertaken to look into these irregularities.</P>
<P>43. The inspection was undertaken by Foreign Affairs Inspector General Barbara Richardson (&ldquo;Ms. Richardson&rdquo;). Ms. Richardson arrived in Tel Aviv with a large team and conducted the inspection over a week, in the immediate aftermath of the tremendously stressful war during the summer of 2014.</P>
<P>44. At the end of the inspection, Ms. Richardson met with the Plaintiff and gave her a verbal debrief. The Plaintiff was shocked to learn that she had in effect been the focus of the inspection, and that none of the serious concerns she had raised about the financial and other irregularities under Mr. Hunt had been addressed.</P>
<P>45. During Ms. Richardson's verbal debrief, she levelled very harsh criticism at the Plaintiff, and referenced baseless allegations made against the Plaintiff by unidentified Embassy staff, for which she offered no proof or details.</P>
<P>46. Over a year later, Ms. Richardson produced a draft report from her inspection, comprised of unfounded, defamatory conclusions regarding the Plaintiff's conduct, leadership and competency. The Plaintiff was concerned when she was informed that the report, when finalized, would be posted online and made public.</P>
<P>47. She therefore took her concerns, in writing and in person, with respect to the integrity of the report and process to Mr. Jean.</P>
<P>48. The Plaintiff pleads and advised Mr. Jean that that the timing of the creation of Ms. Richardson's report was suspect, in that it was created over a year after the inspection had been undertaken. The Plaintiff pleads that it was very evident that Ms. Richardson was attempting to time the release of the report in the early writ period during the Fall, 2015 Federal Election as a way to cause embarrassment and reputational damage to the Plaintiff, as well as embarrassment to the Government, an unconscionable and highly political move, and completely contrary to Ms. Richardson's duty to remain politically neutral.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(f)</N><TI>Justification of the Defamation of the Plaintiff as Merely &ldquo;Part of the Plaintiff's Job&rdquo;</TI>
<P>49. The harassment and defamation of the Plaintiff became progressively worse throughout her tenure as Ambassador.</P>
<P>50. Ongoing leaks to the media, as well as opinion editorials written by former Department employees and radio interviews, consistently defamed her and questioned her competency.</P>
<P>51. The Plaintiff's competency and professionalism was openly questioned, with no basis, by various senior staff in Tel Aviv, Ottawa and elsewhere. Her authority was constantly undermined, and the Embassy staff were encouraged by personnel within the Department of Foreign Affairs to make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to do her job as Ambassador.</P>
<P>52. The Plaintiff's work environment became virtually intolerable, and the Plaintiff consistently reached out to Mr. Jean and Mr. Gwozdecky and others to put an end to it. However, her complaints were ignored and dismissed, and she was repeatedly told by them that there was &ldquo;<EM>nothing that could be done</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>53. Of particular concern to the Plaintiff were the constant untrue and defamatory leaks to the media that were clearly coming from Foreign Affairs Department Officials, which the Plaintiff specifically addressed with Mr. Jean. In response, he told her in November 2015: &ldquo;<EM>that's part of the job, Vivian</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(g)</N><TI>Constant Questioning of Her Loyalty to Canada</TI>
<P>54. The Plaintiff pleads that her loyalty to Canada was questioned since before her appointment even commenced, which the Plaintiff maintains is due to the fact that she is openly supportive of Israel.</P>
<P>55. In fact, the Plaintiff was repeatedly accused by various Senior individuals in the Department of Foreign Affairs of putting &ldquo;Israel's <EM>interests before those of Canada</EM>.&rdquo; Her loyalty to Canada was constantly questioned, and Department officials spread a malicious rumour that she had gone &ldquo;<EM>rogue</EM>&rdquo; and set up a parallel Embassy structure in Israel in order to implement a personal agenda.</P>
<P>56. At some point, a senior, high-profile academic with close ties to the Department even told the Plaintiff &ldquo;<EM>They hate you and will destroy you as soon as they can</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>57. Such defamatory comments made by Department staff were also re-communicated to the press which were, in turn, reported in the media including but not limited to:
<P1>(i) On May 25, 2016, a front-page story appeared in the Globe &amp; Mail, with Robert Fife reporting the following about the Plaintiff:
<ITEM><P><EM>&ldquo;She was widely viewed within Global Affairs as someone who is unschooled in diplomacy and too ideologically connected to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Government.&rdquo;</EM></P></ITEM></P1>
<P1>(ii) On July 19, 2016, Robert Fife reported on a major diplomatic shuffle made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stephane Dion. This article made reference to the Plaintiff, with Mr. Fife quoting retired Department Official Ferry de Kerckhove:
<ITEM><P><EM>&ldquo;Mr. de Kerckhove said Global Affairs would be feeling &ldquo;total, total elation&rdquo; to see Ms. Bercovici yanked out of Israel before her normal three to four year term is up</EM>...</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><EM>&ldquo;In a way, she had become the mouthpiece for Netanyahu. She showed no balance at all, he said.&rdquo;</EM></P></ITEM></P1>
<P1>(iii) On July 8, 2017, Sasa Petricic, former CBC Middle East correspondent based in Jerusalem who was at the time based in China, tweeted the following:
<ITEM><P><EM>&ldquo;#Canada Ambassador (&amp;Harper pol apptee) to #Israel @VivianBercovici recalled, after term where staff said she put Israel interests 1<SUP>st</SUP> #CBC&rdquo;</EM></P></ITEM></P1></P>
<P>58. These malicious, defamatory attacks made by members of the Public Service and subsequently reported by the media significantly hindered the Plaintiff's ability to fulfil her mandate as Ambassador, yet she was offered little or no assistance in defending against these vicious and unmeritorious attacks on her integrity and loyalty.</P>
<P>59. Senior Department officials also worked hard to undermine and frustrate the Plaintiff's mandate of developing more robust commercial ties with Israel, as they did not support the Government's mandate of strengthening these ties with Israel.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(h)</N><TI>Deprivation of Her Outreach With the Canadian Jewish Community</TI>
<P>60. In attempting to carry out her role as Canada's Ambassador to Israel, the Plaintiff wanted to reach out to the Jewish community in Canada. However, the Plaintiff was actively prevented by Mr. Gwozdecky and other senior Department officials from engaging in any community outreach with the Jewish community in Canada. In that regard, she was not permitted to accept any invitations to speak to or attend Jewish community events in Canada, and was explicitly told by Mr. Gwozdecky &ldquo;<EM>your job is over there Vivian, not here</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>61. The Plaintiff pleads that the outright prevention of the Plaintiff interacting with the Canadian Jewish community was directly at odds with the common practice of other Ambassadors, who did spend some time in Canada doing outreach, including the current Canadian Ambassador for Israel.</P>
<P>62. From this and all of the other actions, and inactions of the Department, it was evident to the Plaintiff that Mr. Gwozdecky, Mr. Jean and other senior members of the Department did not want the Plaintiff to foster diplomatic ties with the Canadian Jewish population and Israel, but rather wanted the Plaintiff to be seen and heard as little as possible, follow their own agenda, and not the diplomatic or policy agenda of the Government</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(i)</N><TI>Fall 2015: Pre-Election&mdash;The Plaintiff Becomes a Political Pawn</TI>
<P>63. As the Fall of 2015 approached, it became evident to members of the Department that a change in Government was likely, at which point the Plaintiff became a political pawn.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(j)</N><TI>Threatened with Dismissal</TI>
<P>64. Rumours of the Plaintiff's impending dismissal were rampant throughout Ottawa and the Department.</P>
<P>65. Although the abuse of the Plaintiff had continued since the inception of her Appointment as Ambassador, and had become virtually intolerable, it was at that point that the Department's treatment of the Plaintiff became outright hostile, and the Plaintiff was treated as an enemy and target.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(k)</N><TI>Instructed to Contradict the Government's Position</TI>
<P>66. During the Fall 2015 Federal election campaign, the Plaintiff was instructed by Department staff to post a very controversial statement to her social media that was squarely in contradiction to the Government's stance on Middle Eastern policy. The Plaintiff refused to do so, specifically stating that she had never before been so instructed, and reminding the Department that the Government was still in power with a Middle Eastern policy still in place.</P>
<P>67. The Liberal Party of Canada won the Federal election on October 20, 2015, and Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister.</P>
<P>68. During the election campaign and following the election, the Department celebrated Prime Minister Trudeau's repeated assertions that diplomatic personnel would be &ldquo;<EM>unfettered</EM>&rdquo; in their interactions in the media.</P>
<P>69. Immediately following the election, in fact, there was a strong interest in the politics of the Middle East primarily due to Prime Minister Trudeau's commitment to the Syrian refugees, who were displaced as a result of the ongoing conflict in Syria.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(l)</N><TI>Instructed to be Dishonest to the Media</TI>
<P>70. Shortly after the election, a CBC reporter based in Israel requested a media interview with the Plaintiff. Senior Department personnel, and in particular, Assistant Deputy Minister Alex Bugailiskis, (&ldquo;Ms. Bugailiskis&rdquo;) instructed the Plaintiff to be dishonest to the media and say that she was not available for interviews.</P>
<P>71. The Plaintiff pleads that she was therefore prevented from doing any CBC interviews, and it appeared that the intention was to muzzle her, and have her &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; in the media.</P>
<P>72. Mindful of continuing to represent Canada as being supportive of Israel, the Plaintiff continued to engage with local Israeli media, most often in Hebrew.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(m)</N><TI>Baselessly Questioning Previously Approved Expenses and Decisions</TI>
<P>73. In early Fall, 2015, Ms. Bugailiskis was appointed as Assistant Deputy Minister for Europe, the Middle East and Maghreb. Her treatment of the Plaintiff was immediately hostile, unprofessional and she, too, engaged in direct, personal attacks of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>74. In that regard, without any basis to do so, Ms. Bugaliskis immediately started questioning the Plaintiff's operational expenses and decisions concerning the Embassy, which the previous Assistant Deputy Minister, Mr. Costello, had approved. In many cases, these matters had also been approved by the Deputy Minister's office.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(n)</N><TI>Prevented from Transitioning with Dignity and Respect</TI>
<P>75. It was abundantly evident to the Plaintiff that her tenure as Ambassador was going to come to an end under the new Government.</P>
<P>76. The Plaintiff therefore attempted on many occasions to work with the Department and the Prime Minister's Office in a cooperative manner in order to transition out of the Ambassador role professionally, and ensure a proper transition for the incoming Ambassador.</P>
<P>77. She expressed this to both Mr. Jean and Ms. Bugaliskis on many occasions, however, they refused to cooperate with her and reiterated that they did not know anything about whether she would continue to serve as Ambassador, which was clearly false.</P>
<P>78. The Plaintiff was becoming increasingly stressed and anxious, as she had every indication that her appointment would soon be recalled, and the rumours of this were widespread in Canada and Israel.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(o)</N><TI>Threatened With &ldquo;<EM>We Can Do Whatever We Want to You</EM>&rdquo;</TI>
<P>79. The Plaintiff met with Mr. Jean on or about March 26, 2016, and again expressed her desire to transition out of the role professionally and with dignity, to which Mr. Jean answered &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Vivian, we can do whatever we want to you</EM></BOLD>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>80. The Plaintiff became quite fearful as a result, and requested that he convey her request for a professional departure to the Office of the Privy Council, which he committed to doing.</P>
<P>81. Although Mr. Jean agreed that it would be a professional departure, reality demonstrated that it was anything but professional.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(p)</N><TI>Failure to Assist</TI>
<P>82. On April 12, 2016, having heard nothing further from Mr. Jean, the Plaintiff wrote to him to inquire. Mr. Jean responded and said &ldquo;<EM>Hi Vivian, as promised, I passed your message to the PCO. No feedback yet</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>83. The Plaintiff pleads that as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was in a position to be able to ensure that the Plaintiff had a timely response to her request, but as he had done throughout her Appointment, he wilfully and intentionally did nothing further to assist the Plaintiff in determining when she would have to leave her position, and the particulars relating to her exit from her role.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Bad Faith Post-Termination Behaviour</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK5><N>(q)</N><TI>Termination of Appointment in Telephone Call&mdash;&ldquo;<EM>Out in 2 Weeks</EM>&rdquo; / Ambiguous Dismissal Date</TI>
<P>84. Finally, on April 21, 2016, Ms. Bugaliskis advised the Plaintiff in a telephone call that her appointment as Ambassador would be terminated, and that she needed to be &ldquo;<EM>out</EM>&rdquo; in two weeks, but that she had argued for a 6&ndash;8 week &ldquo;<EM>working notice</EM>&rdquo; period.</P>
<P>85. The Plaintiff pleads that she had become even more distressed as a result of receiving news of her dismissal, with no clear departure date or idea of how she would transition out of her role.</P>
<P>86. In that regard, the Plaintiff's distress was further heightened due to an upcoming visit with Ontario's Premier, Kathleen Wynne, which had been scheduled many months before. In particular, it had been arranged that Premier Wynne would visit Israel for a significant week-long visit at the end of May. Ms. Bugaliskis made it clear that she expected the Plaintiff to fulfil all of her duties associated with her role, and in respect of this visit would include all the preparation work, meetings with her, and then just be &ldquo;<EM>out</EM>&rdquo; as Ambassador.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(r)</N><TI>Threatened to Tell No One of her Departure</TI>
<P>87. She was told that she was to &ldquo;<EM>tell no one</EM>&rdquo; that she was leaving, and was expected to arrange her own departure. Essentially, the Plaintiff was expected to just &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; without extending any of the usual professional courtesies, calls or explanations.</P>
<P>88. By this time, rumours of the Plaintiff's impending departure had been circulating in both Ottawa and Israel. During this time, the Plaintiff was asked at every event she attended in Israel whether she was &ldquo;leaving&rdquo;, which placed her in an uncomfortable position, knowing she had to lie and pretend she knew nothing.</P>
<P>89. In fact, when the Times of Israel had learned that the Plaintiff was no longer going to be the Ambassador, they asked her to confirm her recall. However, due to the ban under which she was placed, the Plaintiff had to pretend and say &ldquo;<EM>all I can say is that I serve at the pleasure of the Prime Minister. I continue to do my job each day</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(s)</N><TI>Organize and Appear for Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne's Visit, But Disappear</TI>
<P>90. Despite all that was going on, the Plaintiff was instrumental in organizing Premier Wynne's visit, which was touted as a major success, and which resulted in excellent Israeli press coverage and expressions of profound gratitude from both Premier Wynne and her Principal Secretary, Andrew Bevan.</P>
<P>91. Preparing for a one-week visit with an exceptionally large delegation, as was Premier Wynne's, was an enormous undertaking and a significant amount of work at any time, which was made all the more difficult given the immense pressure that the Plaintiff was under knowing she would soon be out, and have to disappear from this role after the visit ended.</P>
<P>92. In addition, during this time, the Plaintiff continued to do Israeli media interviews in Hebrew, to ensure that the Israeli press knew that the new Federal Government would continue to be supportive of Israel. The Plaintiff pleads that she continued to work extremely hard until the very end, and that the new Government benefited from this immensely before they discarded her.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(t)</N><TI>Differential, Harsh Treatment in Stark Contrast to other Diplomatic Appointees</TI>
<P>93. At the same time as the Plaintiff was organizing Premier Wynne's visit, she was also under extreme pressure to &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; plan a move, obtain new medical and dental benefits and find a new rental accommodation for her family, which is extremely difficult to do on short notice in Israel's competitive rental market.</P>
<P>94. The media leaks continued, and the press wrote stories about how the Plaintiff had been terminated. Her reputation was gravely and publicly damaged, and to this day, the Plaintiff is approached by individuals who ask what &ldquo;<EM>she did wrong</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>95. In particular, one senior political aide and diplomat with decades of experience in Israel, questioned why the Plaintiff had not told anyone in advance of her departure, and asked &ldquo;<EM>did you break the law</EM>&rdquo;?</P>
<P>96. The Plaintiff pleads that the fact that she was forbidden to tell anyone of her pending departure, and was expected to just disappear as the Ambassador was in stark contrast to the manner in which other diplomatic and political appointees are treated, which continued to tarnish the Plaintiff's already tattered reputation.</P>
<P>97. From the time she received the call notifying her that her Appointment would come to an end, until it actually did, the Plaintiff received no transitional monies, or assistance, nor help in finding a new home. In fact, throughout the Wynne visit, the Plaintiff had been forced to scramble to find accommodation, put her benefits in place, and generally start a new life in a ridiculously short period of time, She had no further income expected past the last date of her Appointment, and therefore, at least hoped to receive her pension monies she was due and owed.</P>
<P>98. Little did the Plaintiff know that she would spend the next two years, and up to the present date, fighting over the small amount of money that her pension contributions would have provided, but was steadfastly refused, at a time when she was both so emotionally and financially vulnerable. The Plaintiff pleads that even the small amount of money, had it been provided immediately, would have provided some financial assistance to the Plaintiff at the time. The Plaintiff therefore pleads that the intentional withholding of these contributions, to which the Plaintiff was entitled, was another calculated, and insensitive act reflecting the Defendants' continued unconscionable behaviour.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(u)</N><TI>Withholding of the Plaintiff's Pension Contributions</TI>
<P>99. During her tenure as Ambassador to Israel, the Plaintiff was a member of the diplomatic service (special) pension plan (&ldquo;Plan&rdquo;) and elected to make contributions to the Plan under the <EM>Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act</EM> (&ldquo;<EM>DSSA</EM>&rdquo;). As a result, her total pension contributions to the Plan for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 were $29,609.94.</P>
<P>100. Sections 5(8) and (10) of the <EM>DSSA</EM> stipulate that a public official in the position of the Plaintiff is entitled, on retirement or resignation, to a return of total pension contributions plus interest calculated at a rate of 4% compounded annually. The Minister of Foreign Affairs (&ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;) has taken the position that sections 5(8) and (10) of the <EM>DSSA</EM> apply to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was therefore entitled, as of June 30, 2016, to the return of her pension contributions of $29,609.94 and interest of $2,364.38 (<EM>i.e.</EM> a total amount of $31,974.32).</P>
<P>101. There is no statutory process or timeline that governs the return of pension contributions under section 5(8) of the <EM>DSSA</EM>. Given that pension contributions belong to the contributor and are held in trust by the Government for the benefit of the contributor, there is an implied duty on the Minister to act in the best interests of a public official in administering the process of returning pension contributions. This requires the Minister to act in good faith and in a timely manner.</P>
<P>102. Shortly after receiving verbal notice of the termination of her appointment, the Plaintiff was forced to retain legal counsel in a futile effort to negotiate with the Government over the return of her pension contributions.</P>
<P>103. On several occasions during May and June 2017, the Plaintiff through her legal counsel, wrote to officials in the Privy Council Office (&ldquo;PCO&rdquo;) and the Prime Minister's Office (&ldquo;PMO&rdquo;) requesting the immediate return of her pension contributions since she urgently needed the funds to cover significant expenses she was incurring due to the termination. These requests were refused (and in the case of the PMO were ignored).</P>
<P>104. The PCO relied on section 5(8) of the <EM>DSSA</EM> for the position that the Plaintiff was only entitled to a return of her pension contributions after the effective date of the termination of her appointment (<EM>i.e.</EM> after June 30, 2018) and that nothing whatsoever could be done prior to June 30, 2016.</P>
<P>105. To that end, on June 21, 2016, the Plaintiff, through her legal counsel, expressly requested to PCO that Foreign Affairs initiate the process for the return of the Plaintiff's pension contributions on July 1, 2016. The Plaintiff understood and expected that Foreign Affairs would treat this request as a priority given her precarious financial position and her immediate financial needs, both of which were well-known to Foreign Affairs.</P>
<P>106. The Plaintiff completed and submitted all the required forms for the return of her pension contributions in August 2016. She also provided a direction to the Government of Canada Pension Centre (&ldquo;Pension Centre&rdquo;) that the pension contributions be transferred to her RRSP investment account at BMO Nesbitt Burns. The Pension Centre is the office in New Brunswick that administers the return of pension contributions under the <EM>DSSA</EM>.</P>
<P>107. In late October 2016, the Plaintiff became concerned because she had heard nothing from the Pension Centre in response to the forms she had submitted in August 2016. On October 28, 2016, the Plaintiff requested an update from the Pension Centre.</P>
<P>108. The Pension Centre responded on October 28, 2016, advising the Plaintiff that it could not process the return of pension contributions until it received a form from Global Affairs stipulating her last day of employment, final salary and whether there are any amounts due to the Crown. The representative of the Pension Centre advised the Plaintiff that the form had not been received &ldquo;<EM>although I have requested it on three occasions</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(v)</N><TI>Attempts to Set-Off Pension Monies with Alleged Overpayment</TI>
<P>109. On November 29, 2016, the Plaintiff received a letter from the Public Service Pay Centre (Compensation and Benefits) advising her that she had received three &ldquo;overpayments&rdquo; that would be recovered &ldquo;<EM>from the first available funds that become due and payable at termination of employment</EM>&rdquo;. The alleged overpayments were described as follows:
<P1>i. Transition overpayment: an amount of $6,853.73 (gross) related to a transition payment on May 21, 2014 (<EM>i.e.</EM> more than two years previously);</P1>
<P1>ii. Regular pay overpayment: an amount of $26,947.57 (net) related to a payment of October 19, 2016;</P1>
<P1>iii. Ongoing overpayment not fully paid: an amount of $24,368.89 related to a posting loan.</P1></P>
<P>110. The letter of <EM>November</EM> 29, 2016 also advised the Plaintiff that she was owed an amount of. $6507.36 respecting earned but unused leave credits.</P>
<P>111. While the letter of November 29, 2016 stated that the Government intended to recover the above-described <EM>overpayments</EM> from funds due and payable to the Plaintiff, it did not state that the overpayments would be deducted from the Plaintiff's pension contributions. In fact, the letter advised the Plaintiff that she should contact the Pension Centre to receive a &ldquo;personalized pension package&rdquo; and certain additional forms.</P>
<P>112. The Plaintiff pleads that the letter of November 29, 2016 was inaccurate, confusing and alarming. It was already apparent that Global Affairs had failed to provide information to the Pension Centre that was <EM>required</EM> for the return of contributions (despite the Plaintiff expressly asking Global Affairs to make the return of pension contributions a priority after June 30, 2016). It now became clear that Global Affairs intended to make significant claims against the Plaintiff, and her pension monies.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(w)</N><TI>Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, Katie Telford, Ignores Repeated Requests for Immediate Intervention</TI>
<P>113. On December 14, 2016, the Plaintiff, through her legal counsel, wrote to the Deputy Minister of Global Affairs disputing the Government's ability to withhold pension contributions or claim set off against them and seeking: (i) a detailed accounting to support the overpayment claims in the November 29, 2016 letter; and (ii) the Deputy Minister's immediate intervention to resolve the issue of the Plaintiff's pension contributions.</P>
<P>114. This correspondence was copied to Ms. Telford at the PMO. In addition, the Plaintiff, through her counsel, wrote to Ms. Telford on numerous occasions to request the PMO's assistance in addressing this matter. In a letter dated June 13, 2016, the Plaintiff's counsel informed Ms. Telford of the serious situation of the Government's withholding of the Plaintiff's pension, stating:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Ms. Bercovici's appointment as an Ambassador will terminate on June 30, 2016. What is in dispute is not the decision to terminate the appointment itself, but the manner in which the decision has been executed and the resulting treatment of her, which is shameful</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>115. On June 20, 2016, the Plaintiff's counsel sent Ms. Telford a follow up email and telephoned her office. In this email, after summarizing the issues and what had transpired, the Plaintiff's counsel wrote:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Once again I am writing to you because of the immediate attention required. To this point the response of government officials has been unresponsive at best. The troubling question is why?</EM></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>116. Ms. Telford ignored every single one of the Plaintiff's requests for assistance, and to date, has never responded to the Plaintiff or her counsel.</P>
<P>117. While the Plaintiff was awaiting a response to the letter of December 14, 2016, she received a second letter from the Public Service Pay Centre (Compensation and Benefits) on December 19, 2016. This second letter was materially identical to the first letter of November 29, 2016, except that the alleged overpayment related to a posting loan was now being reduced from $24,368.89 to $13,881.37. No satisfactory explanation was provided for this very significant reduction in the amount related to the posting loan.</P>
<P>118. The Deputy Minister of Global Affairs did not respond to the letter of December 14, 2016, prompting the Plaintiff, through her counsel on approximately 13 separate occasions to ask Global Affairs Legal Counsel, Shawn Minnis to provide her with relevant information, gave her consent for her counsel to access relevant information held by the Government, and request updates about when she should expect a response.</P>
<P>119. Mr. Minnis did not respond to the letters of December 14 and 23, 2016 until May 4, 2017 (<EM>i.e.</EM> over 4 months after Mr. Minnis undertook to respond &ldquo;<EM>as soon as possible</EM>&rdquo;), when he purported to provide &ldquo;<EM>an accounting of the financial issues</EM>&rdquo;. He claimed that the delay in responding was caused by the &ldquo;<EM>complexity of the set off calculations</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>120. When he finally responded, Mr. Minnis purported to address amounts that the Plaintiff allegedly owed to the Government <UNDER>and</UNDER> amounts the Government owed to the Plaintiff. On the latter point, the letter addressed the Plaintiff's entitlement to performance pay and bonus for the year April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, which the Plaintiff was expecting to receive since the termination date of her appointment was subsequent to March 31, 2016. The Plaintiff received a performance rating of &ldquo;succeeded (minus)&rdquo;, which limited her performance pay to 6% of salary and resulted in no bonus.</P>
<P>121. The letter of May 4, 2017 was not a full accounting of the issues and raised more questions than it answered. As one example, the letter of May 4, 2017 provided a third different figure for the alleged overpayment related to a posting loan (on this occasion the amount was $13,934.85) without any explanation for the discrepancy.</P>
<P>122. The Plaintiff through her legal counsel responded on May 17, 2017, asking Mr. Minnis to address a number of issues arising from his letter of May 4, 2017, including:
<P1>1. <UNDER>Timing of the ROC Process</UNDER>: The Plaintiff sought an explanation for the Government's position that the Plaintiff could not begin the process for the return of her pension contributions until after the effective date of her termination.</P1>
<P1>2. <UNDER>Performance Pay and Bonus</UNDER>: The Plaintiff sought full disclosure of information relevant to her performance rating of &ldquo;succeeded (minus)&rdquo; for the period April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016.</P1>
<P1>3. <UNDER>Pension Contributions/Interest</UNDER>: The Plaintiff sought an assurance that the Government would pay her interest on her pension contributions for the period after June 30, 2016.</P1>
<P1>4. <UNDER>Transition Payment</UNDER>: The Plaintiff asked for the authority that would permit the Government to demand repayment of a transition payment that was made to her 3 years ago.</P1>
<P1>5. <UNDER>Posting Loan</UNDER>: The Plaintiff asked for an explanation of why the calculations related to the posting loan kept changing.</P1>
<P1>6. <UNDER>Government's Right to Set Off</UNDER>: The Plaintiff disputed the Government's right to claim set off against a return of pension contributions and asked for some legal authority beyond section 155(1) of the <EM>Financial Administration Act</EM> (&ldquo;<EM>FAA</EM>&rdquo;), which is not clear on the issue. The Plaintiff also pointed out that the Minister had to consent to any set off under section 155(1) (see section 155(4) of the <EM>FAA</EM>) and insisted on being provided with all relevant information and documents concerning the Minister's consent in her case.</P1>
<P1>7. <UNDER>Legal Costs</UNDER>: The Plaintiff requested reimbursement of her legal costs in respect of the pension contributions issue, since the Government's inaction and conduct had given her no choice but to retain legal counsel to pursue the matter.</P1></P>
<P>123. During the period from May 17 to August 4, 2017, the Plaintiff, through her legal counsel, communicated with Mr. Minnis on four separate occasions seeking a response to the letter of May 4, 2017 and expressing astonishment over the Government's conduct and delay.</P>
<P>124. On August 10, 2017 (<EM>i.e.</EM> about 3 (three) months after the letter of May 17, 2017), Mr. Minnis purported to provide responses to the questions raised in the letter of May 17, 2017. This letter was not responsive on several issues (as one example, the letter did not provide any information or documents concerning the required Ministerial consent under section 155(4) of the <EM>FAA</EM>).</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(x)</N><TI>Undated and Unsigned Performance Review Used as Justification to Delay Bonus and Performance Pay</TI>
<P>125. In response to the Plaintiff's request for information to support the decision to grant her only 6% performance pay and deny her bonus for 2015-2016, the letter of August 10, 2017 included as an attachment an undated and unsigned performance review for 2015-2016. This document, which the Plaintiff had never seen before, contained very negative and inaccurate statements about the Plaintiff and alleged performance transgressions.</P>
<P>126. The sudden appearance on August 10, 2017 of an undated and unsigned performance review for 2015-2016 raised obvious concerns for the Plaintiff. In particular, the Plaintiff understood that there was a strict practice in the Department of managers reviewing performance reviews with the subject and both signing off on the review. The Plaintiff served until June 30, 2016, which was a full three months after the end of the 2015-2016 fiscal year, yet no one ever discussed a performance review with the Plaintiff. Moreover, the Plaintiff had expressly requested on December 30, 2016 that Global Affairs provide her with any performance review or performance-related document related to 2015-2016. At that time, she received nothing in response.</P>
<P>127. Notably, the letter of August 10, 2017 closed with the following statement: &ldquo;<EM>The Pay Centre will now finalize the set off calculation and a letter confirming the accounting will be sent to you and your client</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>128. On August 29, 2017, the Plaintiff, through her legal counsel, wrote to Mr. Minnis demanding the following information about the performance review document attached to the letter of August 10, 2017: (1) the date when the document was prepared; (2) the person(s) who authored/prepared this document; and (3) the purpose for which this document was prepared.</P>
<P>129. During the period August 29, 2017 to December 14, 2017, the Plaintiff received no response to her legal counsel's letter of August 29, 2017. On December 14, 2017 the Plaintiff's legal counsel spoke to Mr. Minnis by telephone. Mr. Minnis advised the Plaintiff's legal counsel that the performance review had been prepared by Ms. Bugailiskis. Mr. Minnis stated that the Plaintiff should contact Ms. Bugailiskis directly if she wanted information about the performance review.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(y)</N><TI>Government Lawyer Forces the Plaintiff to Litigate to Get her Pension Monies</TI>
<P>130. During the December 14, 2017 conversation, despite the original position that the Plaintiff was entitled to her pension monies, Mr. Minnis stated that the Plaintiff was not entitled to engage in discovery and that she should:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Go ahead and litigate. My client is not going to pay anything! Stop trying to engage in discovery when you have no right to do so</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>131. The Plaintiff's legal counsel responded that it would be wholly inappropriate for the Plaintiff (his client) to be contacting Mr. Minnis' client directly on a matter in dispute between the parties. The Plaintiff's legal counsel reiterated the Plaintiff's demand for all relevant information concerning the PURPORTED performance review document.</P>
<P>132. Shortly after the telephone conversation of December 14, 2017, Mr. Minnis wrote to the Plaintiff's legal counsel as follows: &ldquo;Further <EM>to our conversation this morning, this will confirm that I will inquire into the status of the determination by PCO as to performance pay (which I understand is what is holding up the calculation of the set off), and I will review your questions regarding your client's last performance review and provide you with our client's position</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>133. Since December 14, 2017 the Plaintiff has heard nothing further from Mr. Minnis or any other official of the Government in response to her request for information about the PURPORTED performance review document prepared by Ms. Bugailiskis. She has also not received anything from the Pay Centre finalizing the Government's set off calculations and confirming the accounting (which was promised in the letter of August 10, 2017).</P>
<P>134. On February 7, 2018 the Plaintiff through her legal counsel wrote a final letter to Mr. Minnis reiterating her concerns about the Government's failure to provide requested information about Ms. Bugailiskis' performance review. The letter stated, &ldquo;<EM>We will not repeat our very reasonable questions that we have been asking now for two years, nor will we continue to engage in this &ldquo;process&rdquo; that is clearly intended to frustrate and wear out [the Plaintifft]</EM>&rdquo;</P>
<P>135. Mr. Minnis responded on February 8, 2018 to the letter of February 7, 2018 stating, &ldquo;<EM>I...will get back to you once I have reviewed it and obtained instructions</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>136. As of the date of this Statement of Claim, no one from the Government including Mr. Minnis has responded to the letters of August 29, 2017 and February 7, 2018 despite clear undertakings from Mr. Minnis that he would respond.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(z)</N><TI>Repeated, Inexplicable Withholdings of the Plaintiff's Pension Monies 2 Years After the Plaintiff is Terminated</TI>
<P>137. As of the date of this Statement of Claim, which is 2 years after the effective date of the termination of the Plaintiff's appointment as Ambassador to Israel, the Plaintiff's pension contributions and interest have not been returned to her, despite sections 5(8) and (10) of the <EM>DSSA</EM> which make clear that she is entitled to her pension monies, and despite the repeated requests from her counsel to seek immediate intervention on this issue to assist the Plaintiff at her most emotionally and financially vulnerable time.</P>
<BLOCK6><TI>DAMAGES</TI></BLOCK6></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</TI>
<P>138. The Plaintiff pleads that she was in a fiduciary relationship with the Attorney General, at the heart of which lay the dual concepts of trust and loyalty. The Plaintiff pleads that by virtue of the very special nature of the Ambassadorial relationship, as pleaded above, the Attorney General:
<P1>(a) Had the scope for the exercise of discretion and power;</P1>
<P1>(b) Could unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the Plaintiff's legal or practical interests; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The Plaintiff was peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the Attorney General holding the discretion or power.</P1></P>
<P>139. The Plaintiff further pleads that of all the factors above, her complete vulnerability at the hands of the Attorney General was indispensable to the existence of the fiduciary relationship which existed at the time between she and the Attorney General.</P>
<P>140. The Plaintiff therefore pleads that the Attorney General breached its fiduciary duties to her when it committed the actions and inactions, as pleaded above, and in so doing, caused her significant damages, for which it is liable, in the amount of $1,000,000.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Breach of the Doctrine of the Duty of Good Faith in both Contractual Performance and/or Bad Faith Manner of Dismissal</TI></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Damages for Breach of the Duty of Honesty in Contractual Performance</TI>
<P>141. The Plaintiff pleads that all of the Defendants' conduct, as described above, constitutes a breach of the doctrine of the duty of good faith, including the duty of honesty in contractual performance, which amounts to a breach of contract. In that regard, it was an implied duty with her Appointment that the Defendants' would treat her in good faith, with honesty, in a reasonable, candid, and forthright manner, which the Plaintiff pleads the Defendants' failed to do since the time of her Appointment.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Moral Damages for the Bad Faith Manner of Dismissal</TI>
<P>142. In determining the Plaintiff's moral damages, the Plaintiff pleads that this Honourable Court ought to account for the Defendant, the Attorney General of Canada and the individual defendants' unconscionable and malicious treatment of her, resulting in their failure to comply with their duty of good faith and fair dealings in the manner of dismissal, and contractual duty of honesty in both their pre and post-termination conduct.</P>
<P>143. In that regard, the Plaintiff pleads that when the parties entered into the Appointment, it was contemplated that if the Attorney General of Canada were to breach its duty of good faith and fair dealings upon the termination of the Plaintiff's Appointment, it was reasonably foreseeable that this would cause her mental distress.</P>
<P>144. The Plaintiff therefore pleads and relies upon the following in support of both damages for breach of the duty of good faith and honesty in contractual performance and/or moral damages:</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Bad Faith Pre-Termination Behaviour</TI>
<P><P1>a) Openly sidelining and questioning the Plaintiff's competency during the Prime Minister's Official Visit to Israel in January, 2014;</P1>
<P1>b) Rebuffing and ignoring the Plaintiff's security concerns with the Official Residence;</P1>
<P1>c) Maliciously defaming the Plaintiff through the media and to the Plaintiff's Embassy staff;</P1>
<P1>d) Stripping the Plaintiff of authority and severely hindering her ability to do her job;</P1>
<P1>e) Scapegoating the Plaintiff after the Plaintiff requested an audit of the predecessor Ambassador's operational management;</P1>
<P1>f) Dismissing the Plaintiff's complaints and justifying the malicious defamation of the Plaintiff as merely &ldquo;<EM>part of the job</EM>&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>g) Questioning the Plaintiff's loyalty to Canada;</P1>
<P1>h) Depriving the Plaintiff the ability to outreach with the Jewish community and business communities, which was an important element of her job;</P1>
<P1>i) Using the Plaintiff as a political pawn before and during the Fall 2015 election;</P1>
<P1>j) Threatening the Plaintiff with dismissal;</P1>
<P1>k) Instructing the Plaintiff to publicly contradict the Government's stance on Middle Eastern policy;</P1>
<P1>l) Instructing the Plaintiff to dishonest to the media;</P1>
<P1>m) Questioning the Plaintiff's previously approved expenses and decisions with no basis for doing so;</P1>
<P1>n) Preventing the Plaintiff from transitioning out of the Ambassador role with dignity and respect;</P1>
<P1>o) Threatening the Plaintiff by telling her &ldquo;<EM>we can do whatever we want</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>p) Failing to assist the Plaintiff when she asked to transition out of role professionally and with dignity;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Bad Faith Post-Termination Behaviour</TI>
<P><P1>q) Terminating the Plaintiff's appointment in a phone call&mdash;extremely short notice;</P1>
<P1>r) Threatening the Plaintiff to &ldquo;<EM>tell no one</EM>&rdquo; about her departure;</P1>
<P1>s) Told to organize and be highly visible during Premier Wynne's visit to Israel, but then disappear;</P1>
<P1>t) Treating the Plaintiff in a manner that is differential and harsh, which is a stark contrast to the manner in which other diplomatic appointees are and have been treated;</P1>
<P1>u) Withholding of the Plaintiff's pension contributions;</P1>
<P1>v) Ms. Telford and the PMO's ignoring of the Plaintiff's repeated requests for intervention and assistance;</P1>
<P1>w) Government's attempts to set-off pension monies with alleged overpayment;</P1>
<P1>x) Undated and unsigned performance review used as justification to deny the Plaintiff her bonus and performance pay;</P1>
<P1>y) Government lawyers forcing the Plaintiff to litigate for return of pension monies; and</P1>
<P1>z) Repeated, inexplicable withholdings of the Plaintiff's pension monies 2 years after the Plaintiff is terminated</P1></P>
<P>145. The Plaintiff pleads that she has suffered incalculable mental distress due to the unconscionable, malicious and vicious actions and inactions taken by the Attorney General and the individual Defendants, as particularized above.</P>
<P>146. The Plaintiff therefore pleads that she is entitled to damages for breach of the contractual duty of good faith and honesty in the amount of $1,000,000, or in the alternative, moral damages in the amount of $1,000,000.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Tort of Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering as Against as Against all Personal Defendants</TI>
<P>147. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of all of the individual personal Defendants reflected actions and inactions that went beyond their respective individual duties and responsibilities and as such, each ought to be held liable for their particularly egregious and tortious actions, in carrying out their unconscionable actions against the Plaintiff.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering by Mr. Gwozdecky</TI>
<P>148. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of the Defendant, Mr. Gwozdecky, was flagrant and outrageous, and was calculated to produce harm which resulted in a visible and provable injury. In this regard, the Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the following intentional acts of Mr. Gwozdecky:
<P1>1.1.1. Defaming the Plaintiff and questioning her competence, professionalism and loyalty to Canada before and throughout her appointment as Ambassador;</P1>
<P1>1.1.2. Sidelining, undermining and severely restricting the Plaintiff's ability to do her job in an effort to sabotage her;</P1>
<P1>1.1.3. Threatening the Plaintiff when she raised serious concerns about the Official Residence;</P1>
<P1>1.1.4. Creating a hostile and toxic work environment for the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>1.1.5. Ignoring and dismissing the Plaintiff's complaints of defamatory conduct from within the Department and failing to take any action to stop it; and</P1>
<P1>1.1.6. Preventing the Plaintiff from engaging in community outreach with the Jewish community in Canada in an attempt to sideline and diminish the Plaintiff and prevent her from doing her job effectively.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering by Mr. Jean</TI>
<P>149. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of the Defendant, Mr. Jean, was flagrant and outrageous, and was calculated to produce harm which resulted in a visible and provable injury. In this regard, the Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the following intentional acts of Mr. Jean:
<P1>1.1.1. Creating a hostile and toxic work environment for the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>1.1.2. Ignoring and dismissing the Plaintiff's complaints of defamatory conduct from within the Department and failing to take any action to stop it;</P1>
<P1>1.1.3. Sidelining, undermining and severely restricting the Plaintiff's ability to do her job in an effort to sabotage her;</P1>
<P1>1.1.4. Failing to take address the Plaintiff's serious concerns with respect to the integrity of Ms. Richardson's inspection report;</P1>
<P1>1.1.5. Justifying and enabling the defamation of the Plaintiff by telling her it is &ldquo;<EM>part of the job</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>1.1.6. Refusing to allow the Plaintiff to transition out of the role of Ambassador with dignity and respect; and</P1>
<P1>1.1.7. Threatening the Plaintiff by telling her &ldquo;<EM>we can do whatever we want to you</EM>&rdquo; when adamantly expressed her desire to transition out of the role of Ambassador with dignity and respect.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering by Ms. Bugailiskis</TI>
<P>150. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of the Defendant, Ms. Bugailiskis, was flagrant and outrageous, and was calculated to produce harm which resulted in a visible and provable injury. In this regard, the Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the following intentional acts of Ms. Bugailiskis:
<P1>1.1.1. Creating a hostile and toxic work environment for the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>1.1.2. Embarking on a targeted, malicious campaign of harassment and defamation against the Plaintiff in an effort to completely discredit the Plaintiff and destroy what was left of her reputation;</P1>
<P1>1.1.3. Instructing the Plaintiff to lie to the media and muzzling the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>1.1.4. Questioning, with ill-intentions, the Plaintiff's previously approved expenses and Embassy decisions in a baseless attack on the Plaintiff's professionalism and credibility;</P1>
<P1>1.1.5. Levelling false allegations against the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>1.1.6. Refusing to allow the Plaintiff to transition out of the role of Ambassador with dignity and respect;</P1>
<P1>1.1.7. Working with the Government to force the Plaintiff out on very little notice, while also expecting the Plaintiff to do an immense amount of work; and</P1>
<P1>1.1.8. Authoring an undated and unsigned performance review, which was maliciously used as justification to delay bonus and performance pay.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering by Ms. Richardson</TI>
<P>151. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of the Defendant, Ms. Richardson, was flagrant and outrageous, and was calculated to produce harm which resulted in a visible and provable injury. In this regard, the Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the following intentional acts of Ms. Richardson:
<P1>1.1.1. Conducting a misleading and unfair &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; of the Plaintiff after she had requested that the Department undertake an audit of the previous Ambassador's operational management;</P1>
<P1>1.1.2. Levelling baseless accusations at the Plaintiff; and</P1>
<P1>1.1.3. Producing a draft report from this &ldquo;inspection&rdquo;, which was filled with unfounded, defamatory conclusions regarding the Plaintiff's conduct, leadership and competency, and attempting to have the report posted publicly.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering by Ms. Telford</TI>
<P>152. The Plaintiff pleads that the conduct of the Defendant, Ms. Telford, was flagrant and outrageous, and was calculated to produce harm which resulted in a visible and provable injury. In this regard, the Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the following intentional acts of Ms. Telford:
<P1>1.1.1. Purposely ignoring repeated requests for immediate intervention and assistance with respect to the Government's unconscionable withholding of the Plaintiff's pension monies.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Punitive</TI></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>As Against the Attorney General of Canada:</TI>
<P>153. The Plaintiff pleads that the Attorney General of Canada's:
<P1>a) Breach of fiduciary duty;</P1>
<P1>b) breach of its contractual duty of good faith and honesty;</P1>
<P1>c) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealings in the manner of dismissal, as outlined at paragraphs 14 through 137, demonstrating the unconscionable pre and post termination conduct of the Defendant;</P1>
<P1>d) its reprisal against the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>e) the public and humiliating course of conduct to which the Plaintiff was subjected; and</P1>
<P1>f) the intentional inflection of mental suffering committed by the individual defendants, as particularized above,</P1>
together, or individually, amounted to behaviour, actions and inactions that were so harsh, vindictive, reprehensible, and malicious that they are deserving of punishment on their own by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>154. The Plaintiff therefore pleads that she is entitled to punitive damages in the amount of $5,000,000 against the Attorney General of Canada, to demonstrate the Court's condemnation of this Defendant's actions.</P>
<P>155. The Plaintiff states that she has been unable to mitigate her damages due to the malicious, reprehensible and intentional actions of all Defendants which have tattered and torn apart her reputation, and from which she will never recover.</P>
<P>156. In that regard, in pursuing her duty to mitigate her damages, she has incurred and will continue to incur certain out-of-pocket expenses to mitigate her damages for which she is entitled to be reimbursed by the Defendants. The Plaintiff undertakes to provide particulars of these expenses prior to the trial of this action.</P>
<P>157. The Plaintiff proposes that this action be tried in the City of Toronto in the Province of Ontario.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE PLAINTIFF</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1: NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>1. This is a motion to amend the style of cause to add the names of five proposed additional Defendants, Katie Telford, Mark Gwozdecky, Daniel Jean, Barbara Richardson, and Alexandra Bugailiskis.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART 2: BACKGROUND</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Parties</TI>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, Vivian Bercovici (&ldquo;Ms. Bercovici&rdquo;), is the former Canadian Ambassador to Israel. She was appointed to her position by the Prime Minister, and served at his pleasure.

<P>3. The organizational Defendant, the Attorney General, is a Ministry of the Federal Government, and carries out its functions as a government entity on behalf of the Crown.</P>
<P>4. The proposed individual Defendant, Mr. Gwozdecky, was Director General, Middle East and Maghreb until November 2015, when he was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister International Security and Political Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>

<P>6. The proposed individual Defendant, Ms. Bugailiskis, is currently the Canadian Ambassador to Italy, San Marino, Albania and High Commissioner to Malta. However, formerly, and at all material times, she was the Assistant Deputy Minister of Europe, the Middle East and Maghreb and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>

<P>9. The organizational Defendant and all proposed Defendants are represented by the same counsel, Mr. Barney Brucker of the Ministry of Justice.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART 3: FACTS</TI>
<P>10. This claim arises out of significant abuse and harassment inflicted on the Plaintiff by key individuals in the Public Service within the Department, who actively worked to undermine and question the Plaintiffs competency, loyalty and professionalism.</P>
<P>11. The Plaintiff commenced an action by issuance of a Notice of Action issued on June 29, 2018, prepared by Plaintiff's original counsel.</P>
<P>12. The style of cause in the Notice of Action lists the Attorney General as the sole Defendant.</P>
<P>13. The Notice of Action contains allegations against the Attorney General as well as &ldquo;responsible officials&rdquo;</P>
<P>14. The Plaintiff changed counsel after the filing of the Notice of Action.</P>
<P>15. Counsel for the Plaintiff prepared a Statement of Claim, with a style of cause that included the five additional proposed Defendants, prior to the deadline for filing of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>16. The court Registrar refused to accept a Statement of Claim with a style of cause that was not identical to that contained in the Notice of Action;</P>
<P>17. The Plaintiff was, therefore, forced to file a Statement of Claim on July 30, 2018 that although made claims against the proposed additional Defendants in the body of the pleading, did not include their names in the style of cause.</P>
<P>18. The Plaintiff put the proposed Defendants' counsel on notice during a phone call on August 21, 2018 and by way of follow-up email of August 23, 2018, that the Plaintiff intended to seek an amendment to the Statement of Claim to add the proposed additional Defendants to the style of cause.</P>
<P>19. At the Case Conference on November 16, 2018, counsel for the proposed Defendants, advised that the Plaintiff would have to bring a motion and that they would object.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART 4: ISSUES AND THE LAW&mdash;RULE 14.03(5)</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff submits that the following issues must be considered on this motion:
<P1>a. Was the refusal by the Court Registrar of the Plaintiff's original Statement of Claim on the grounds that the style of cause in the Notice of Action did not match that in the Statement of Claim proper?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>RULES WITH RESPECT TO COMMENCING A PROCEEDING BY NOTICE OF ACTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. The Plaintiff seeks to have the style of cause in the Statement of Claim amended, <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>, to include the names of the proposed additional Defendants.</P>
<P>21. Rule 14.06(1) requires, &ldquo;every originating process to contain a title of the proceeding setting up the names of all the parties and the in which they are made parties, if other than their personal capacity.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.06 (1)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Rule 14.03(2), states that, &ldquo;where there is insufficient time to prepare a statement of claim, an action may be commenced by issuing a Notice of Action (Form 14C) that contains a short statement of the nature of the claim.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.03 (2)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Rule 14.03(5), states that for &ldquo;an action commenced by the issuing of a notice of action, the statement of claim may alter or extend the claim stated in the notice of action.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.03 (5)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><N>a.</N><TI><UNDER>Was the refusal by the Court Registrar of the Plaintiff's original Statement of Claim, on the grounds that the style of cause in the Notice of Action did not match that in the Statement of Claim proper?</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. The Plaintiff argues that the very intent of section 14.03(2) is to allow a proceeding to be commenced by providing, &ldquo;a short statement of the nature of the claim,&rdquo; where there is be insufficient time to prepare a statement of claim. A Notice of Action is intended to be brief with the expectation that the details of the claims made will be expanded upon, at a later time, in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>25. In light of the brevity of a Notice of Action, as contemplated by the <EM>Rules</EM>, the Plaintiff is permitted the opportunity in a Statement of Claim, pursuant to Rule 14.03(5), &ldquo;...to alter or extend the claim stated in the notice of action.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.03 (5)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. The Plaintiffs Notice of Action contains allegations against the Attorney General and &ldquo;responsible officials.&rdquo; It sets out the nature of the claim as required by Rule 14.03(2).</P>
<P>27. The Statement of Claim initially presented to the Registrar, named &ldquo;the responsible officials&rdquo; contained in the Notice of Action and expanded upon the claims made against them, as permitted under Rule 14.03(5).</P>
<P>28. Furthermore, the Court Registrar provided no basis in the <EM>Rules</EM> upon which refusal of the Plaintiffs original Statement of Claim was grounded.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART 5: ISSUE AND THE LAW&mdash;TECHNICAL IRREGULARITY</TI>
<P><P1>a. In the event that the Court finds that refusal by the Registrar of the Plaintiffs original statement of claim was warranted based on the <EM>Rules</EM>, the Plaintiff asks the court to consider whether the omission of the names of all the Defendants in the style of cause, where their names and the allegations against them appear in the body of the Statement of Claim, is a technical irregularity based on non-compliance with Rule 14.06(1)?</P1>
<P1>b. Does s. 21(1) <EM>of the Limitations Act</EM> preclude a technical amendment to the style of cause?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>TEST FOR ORDERING AMENDMENT TO CORRECT A TECHNICAL IRREGULARITY</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND LIMITATIONS ACT</TI>
<P>29. Rule 14.06(1) requires, &ldquo;every originating process is to contain a title of the proceeding setting up the names of all the parties and the capacity in which they are made parties, if other than their personal capacity.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.06 (1)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. Rule 2.01 states that &ldquo;a failure to comply with the rules is an irregularity, and does not render a proceeding or a step, document or order in a proceeding a nullity.&rdquo; Rule 2.01(a), &ldquo;authorizes a court to grant amendments or other relief as necessary to secure the just determination of &ldquo;the real matters in dispute.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Ref: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 2.01(1) and 2.01(a)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. The Plaintiff also relies on Rule 5.03(1), which states that, &ldquo;every person whose presence is necessary to enable the court to adjudicate effectively and completely on the issues in a proceeding shall be joined as a party to the proceeding.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Ref: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 5.03(1)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. The Plaintiff's position is further supported by Rule 5.04(2), which states that, &ldquo;at any stage of a proceeding the court may by order add, delete or substitute a party or correct the name of a party incorrectly named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 5.04(2)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>CASELAW</TI>
<P>33. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hastings v. Halton Condo Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, counsel for the Plaintiff failed, due to inadvertence, to include the name of a Defendant in the style of cause of the Statement of Claim. The Court ruled that this failure was an irregularity and outlined the factors that led to this conclusion:
<ITEM><P>Material facts supporting the claim against the Defendant have been pled;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The proposed party was put on notice and aware that he/she was an intended Defendant;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The statement of claim names the proposed Defendant as a party Defendant;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The statement of claim assigns blame to the party Defendant and clearly sets out the basis for same;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>&ldquo;There is a coincidence between the plaintiffs intention to name a party and the intended party's knowledge that it was the intended defendant,&rdquo; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>There is a lack of prejudice to the intended Defendant by the proposed amendment to the style of cause.</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>REF:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hastings v. Halton Condo Corp</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 175</CITE><PARANUM>13 and 16</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Plaintiffs position is also supported by the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Silic v Ottawa</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the Court stated that, &ldquo;the omission from the style of cause in the writ of summons of the name of a second plaintiff, whose name appears in the endorsement of such writ, is a mere irregularity and permission to amend does not have the effect of setting up a new cause of action.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Silic v. Ottawa Transportation Commission</SOC><CITE>[1963] 2 O.R. 477139</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD><EM>(Headnote)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. The Plaintiff also relies on the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Dupuis v. W.O. Stinson &amp; Son Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiffs Statement of Claim was rejected by the court Registrar on the final day of the limitation period, because plaintiff's counsel couriered the statement of claim along with the appropriate fee to the courthouse instead of having someone attend personally, as required by the <EM>Rules</EM>.
<P1><BOLD>REF:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Dupuis v. W.O. Stinson &amp; Son Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4317</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2014 CarswellOnt 10117</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. In <EM>Dupuis, the Court</EM> stated that &ldquo;this case does not involve an order to extend the limitation period but rather an order to correct an irregularity; given that the Statement of Claim with the proper style of cause arrived at the courthouse within the limitation period but was rejected by the Registrar.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>APPLICATION OF THE LIMITATIONS ACT TO PLEADING AMENDMENTS</TI>
<P>37. The application of the <EM>Rules</EM> and caselaw must be considered in the context of section 21(1) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>, which states that, &ldquo;If a limitation period in respect of a claim against a person has expired, the claim shall not be pursued by adding the person as a party to any existing proceeding.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Limitations Act, 2002, c. 24, Sched. B, s. 21(1)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. Section 21(2) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> states that, &ldquo;Subsection (1) does not prevent the correction of a misnaming or misdescription of a party.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Limitations Act, 2002, c. 24, Sched. B, s. 21(2)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. In <EM>Hastings</EM>, where counsel for the Plaintiff omitted the name of a Defendant from the style of cause due to inadvertence, and fully pled allegations against the Defendant in the Statement of Claim, the Court acknowledged that the omission of the party defendant from title of proceedings was not a case of misnomer as contemplated by Section 21(2). Notwithstanding, the Court in <EM>Hastings</EM> stated the following at paragraph 14:
<QUOTE><P>In my view, section 21(1) of the <EM>[Limitations] Act</EM> is not designed to prevent a technical amendment of the pleadings in circumstances where the party has been named as a defendant in the statement of claim and the allegations against him are set out with particularity. The case at bar is distinguishable from the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Streamline Foods Ltd. V Jantz Canada Corp.</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 174</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, relied on by the respondent...In <EM>Streamline Food Ltd.</EM>, it was also necessary to plead additional material facts to support the corporation's claim. The Court of Appeal found that the appellants were not seeking to correct the name of a party but rather that they were seeking to add a party and pursue that party's claims and that they were prohibited from doing so by the operation of the Act. In the case at bar, material facts supporting the plaintiffs' claim against Mr. Germann are set out in the claim. To permit the amendment to the style of cause is to allow the remediation of a technical irregularity and is not contrary to the purpose of section 21(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> which is to give the defendant certainty and finality. I conclude that the plaintiffs in this case are not seeking to add Mr. Germann as a party contrary to section 21(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> and that the amendment to the style of cause should be permitted.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK5><N>a.</N><TI><UNDER>Is the omission of the names of the Defendants in a style of cause, where their names and the allegations against them appear in the body of the Statement of Claim, a technical irregularity?</UNDER></TI>
<P>40. The Plaintiff submits that the facts surrounding the addition of Katie Telford, Mark Gwozdecky, Daniel Jean, Barbara Richardson, and Alexandra Bugailiskis meets all the factors outlined in <EM>Hastings</EM> above.</P>
<P>41. The Plaintiff argues that it is not seeking an extension of a limitation period but rather a n order to correct an irregularity. The irregularity being non-compliance with Rule 14.06(1), which requires all parties to the action to be named in the title of proceedings.
<P1><BOLD>REF: <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 14.06 (1)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. The Plaintiff presented the Statement of Claim, containing the names of the additional proposed Defendants in the style of cause and allegations against them, to the Court by the required deadline, however, it was rejected by the Registrar.</P>
<P>43. The Plaintiff argues that an amendment to the style of cause to include the names of the proposed Defendants would not result in prejudice that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</P>
<P>44. From the outset, the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim named the proposed Defendants and outlined the allegations against them.</P>
<P>45. Counsel for the Attorney General, Mr. Brucker, is also counsel for the five proposed additional Defendants.</P>
<P>46. On August 21, 2018, less than one month following service of the Notice of Action and Statement of Claim on July 31, 2018, Mr. Brucker was informed of the Plaintiffs intention to add the proposed individual Defendants. He advised that he expected to be retained by the proposed Defendants.</P>
<P>47. The proposed additional Defendants, therefore, received notice of the claims against them, as of that point and likely earlier.</P>
<P>48. Furthermore, this action is still in its infancy. The Statement of Defence has not been served nor have discoveries taken place.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>b.</N><TI><UNDER>Does s. 21(1) <EM>of the Limitations Act</EM> preclude a technical amendment to the style of cause?</UNDER></TI>
<P>49. Lastly, the Plaintiff submits that, as found in <EM>Hastings</EM>, section 21(1) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> was not intended to prevent technical amendments.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">PART 5: ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff seeks the following relief:
<P1>a. an Order amending the style of cause to add Katie Telford, Mark Gwozdecky, Daniel Jean, Barbara Richardson and, Alexandra Bugailiskis as Defendants to the herein action, <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>;</P1>

The Plaintiff moves to amend the Statement of Claim to add five individuals, Katie Telford, Mark Gwozdecky, Daniel Jean, Barbara Richardson, and Alexandra Bugailiskis, as Defendants to this action in order to maintain claims against each of them for monetary damages based on allegations of intentional infliction of mental suffering at various times while the plaintiff served as Canada's Ambassador to Israel during the period January 2, 2014 to June 30, 2016.</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> The Plaintiff has been represented by experienced counsel throughout her dealings with the Government of Canada that are the subject of this action. The Notice of Action filed on June 29, 2018 makes no mention of any of the individual defendants, nor does it include a claim for damages for the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering. The Statement of Claim also makes clear that the Plaintiff was well aware of the identities of the individuals she wishes to add as defendants and their alleged tortious actions as described in the Statement of Claim well before June 30, 2018.</P>
<P>3. Prior to the delivery of the Statement of Claim, neither the proposed individual defendants nor the Attorney General of Canada (AGC) were put on notice regarding the Plaintiff's intention to make a claim against the aforementioned individuals or any individuals.</P>
<P>4. Contrary to her characterization of this motion as a request to correct a technical irregularity or misnomer, the amendment the Plaintiff seeks would allow her to assert claims against the individuals which are statute-barred pursuant to the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SO 2002, c 24, Sched. B, ss. 4, 5 and 21. The Limitation period applicable to the proposed claims against the individuals sought to be added as defendants expired at the latest on June 30, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> thus depriving them of substantive rights in addition those claims as alleged in the Statement of Claim disclose no cause of action and are not tenable at law.</P>
<P>5. The Respondent requests that the Plaintiff's motion to amend the Statement of Claim be dismissed with costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II: <UNDER>FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. On June 29, 2018, the Plaintiff commenced an action solely against the Attorney General of Canada by way of a Notice of Action.</P>
<P>7. In the Notice of Action, the Plaintiff's sole claim is for damages against the AGC for breach of the duty of fairness, breach of the duty to act in good faith, breach of contract and/or breach of fiduciary duty.</P>
<P>8. On July 31, 2018, the AGC was served with a Statement of Claim naming the AGC as the sole Defendant in the style of cause. Within the body of the Claim, the Plaintiff added the names of the five individuals noted above as well as a new claim for the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering/against these individuals. None of the proposed individual defendants were served with the original Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>9. On August 21, 2018, three weeks following the service and filing of the original Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff's counsel informed counsel for the Respondent during a telephone conversation that she intended to seek an amendment to the Statement of Claim to add the proposed five individual defendants to the style of cause.</P>
<P>10. On August 23, 2018, the Plaintiff's counsel, Ms. Natalie MacDonald, wrote a letter to counsel for the Respondent to follow up on the telephone conversation of August 21. In that letter, Ms. MacDonald notes that she requires his consent to amend the Statement of Claim to add the individual defendants to the style of cause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Motion Record of the Plaintiff (MRP), Affidavit of Ursula Nicola, at para 10, Exhibit &lsquo;E&rsquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. On August 24, 2018, counsel for the Respondent wrote an email to Ms. MacDonald actually sent to her on August 27, 2018 explaining that he was not in a position to consent to the addition of the proposed individual defendants without clarification as to the retainer and being instructed accordingly.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Motion Record of the Respondent (MRR), Affidavit of Camelya Buchanan, at paras 2 and 3, Exhibits &lsquo;A&rsquo;. and &lsquo;B&rsquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. On October 1, 2018, Ms. MacDonald emailed counsel for the Respondent asking for confirmation of instructions from the proposed individual defendants regarding adding them as defendants in the style of cause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Affidavit of Ursula Nicola, at para 11, Exhibit &lsquo;F&rsquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. On October 5, 2018, counsel for the Respondent confirmed that he had been retained by three of the five proposed individual defendants. He explained that the necessary approvals from the appropriate government authorities who must authorize representation have not yet been finalized with respect to two of the proposed defendants, being Daniel Jean and Katie Telford and that instructions would be required from the proposed individual defendants as to their consent to be added as such.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Affidavit of Ursula Nicola, at para 12, Exhibit &lsquo;G&rsquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Counsel for the Respondent suggested that the parties proceed to a case conference stating that the case would benefit from case management.</P>
<P>14. On October 16, 2018, counsel for the Respondent among other things again advised Ms. McDonald that instructions would be required from the individuals as to their proposed addition as defendants to the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Affidavit of Ursula Nicola at para 13, Exhibit &lsquo;H&rsquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. On November 16, 2018, the parties attended a Case Conference before Justice Sandra Nishikawa. At that time, Counsel for the Respondent advised that he had been retained as counsel on behalf of the proposed individual defendants and that he was instructed to resist the Plaintiff's request to add each of the individuals as defendants to this action.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III: <UNDER>POINTS IN ISSUE</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. This motion raises the following issues:
<P1>(i) Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to amend the Statement of Claim to add the proposed five individuals as defendants to this action pursuant to the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RRO, Reg. 194.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>; and,</P1>
<P1>(ii) Whether the claim the Plaintiff seeks to assert against the proposed individual defendants are tenable at law.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV: <UNDER>THE LAW</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Legal Test for Adding parties under Rules 5.04(2) and 26.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P>17. Rule 26 deals with amendments to a pleading. A properly framed pleading that is tenable at law &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be allowed unless it results in prejudice that cannot be addressed in costs or an adjournment. The onus lies upon the defendant to show non-compensable prejudice under the rules. Rule 26.01 provides:
<QUOTE><P>On motion at any stage of an action the court shall grant leave to amend a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not be compensation for by costs or an adjournment.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. Rule 5.04(2) deals specifically with the addition of a party. Rule 5.04(2) provides:
<QUOTE><P>At any stage of a proceeding the court may by order add, delete or substitute any party or correct the name of a party incorrectly named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. Unlike Rule 26.01, the authority to add a party under Rule 5.04(2) is discretionary as the issue of prejudice must be considered before adding a party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Rooplal v Fodor</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 399</CITE><PARANUM>23-24</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Rooplal</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Notably, prejudice is automatically assumed where the claim is brought beyond the expiry of the limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Frohlick Pinkerton Canada Ltd</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 3</CITE><PARANUM>17-18</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Frohlick</EM>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Skrobacky (Litigation guardian of) v Frymer</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4544</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Skrobacky</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There are no special circumstances available to extend the limitation period under the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Joseph v Paramount Canada's Wonderland</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 469</CITE><PARANUM>13, 26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. On a motion to add a party under Rule 5.04, the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> imposes a burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate with evidence why the identity of the party and the claim against it could not have been discovered with due diligence prior to the expiry of the limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Skrobacky</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Section 21(1) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> prohibits the addition of a party to an existing proceeding if a limitation period in respect of claim against the person has expired.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V: SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Plaintiff's claim as against the proposed individual defendants is statute-barred under the <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>.</TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Presumption of Prejudice that cannot be compensated for by costs</EM></TI>
<P>22. The Plaintiff relies on subsection 21(2) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> to argue that where the issue is that of correction of a misnaming or misdescription of a party, subsection 21(1) does not prevent the adding of a party to an existing proceeding following the expiry of a limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Factum of the Plaintiff dated December 11, 2018, at paras 37-38 and</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Plaintiff otherwise concedes that her request to amend the Statement of Claim to add the proposed individual defendants is barred by the operation of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>.</P>
<P>23. The court's discretionary power under Rule 5.04(2) is limited by subsection 21(1) of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>. In this case, the Respondent submits that the Plaintiff is not entitled to rely on subsection 21(2) because this is not a case of misnomer or a technical irregularity.</P>
<P>24. The Ontario Court of Appeal has held that where a limitation period has passed, there will be a presumption of prejudice that cannot be compensated for by costs or an adjournment. The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate why the court should not apply the normal rule that presumption of prejudice flowing from the loss of the limitation period is determinative.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Frohlick</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Respondent submits that the Plaintiff has not discharged this burden.</P>
<P>25. The attempt to add the proposed individuals as defendants is not merely a procedural step. The limitation period is a substantive and justified barrier to endless exposure to liability through litigation.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The jurisprudence relied upon by the Plaintiff is distinguishable</EM></TI>
<P>26. The jurisprudence relied upon by the Plaintiff is distinguishable from the circumstances underpinning the case at bar. The Plaintiff relies on cases where the name of an intended defendant was either omitted by inadvertence or omitted due to error of counsel in the statement of claim. No such evidence has been presented by the Plaintiff in this case.</P>
<P>27. The Affidavit of Ursula Nicola, a legal assistant with the law firm of the Plaintiff's counsel, simply states that the Notice of Action was drafted by former counsel, John D. R. Craig of Fasken. The Affidavit then states that the Plaintiff's current counsel prepared the original Statement of Claim which included the names of the proposed additional five defendants. The Plaintiff presents absolutely no evidence to show that former counsel omitted the names of the proposed individuals unintentionally or by error. The Plaintiff is asking this Court to make an inference that is not available based on the record provided.</P>
<P>28. The Notice of Action in this matter was drafted by experienced counsel, allegedly upon the instruction of the Plaintiff although the Plaintiff is identified as the issuer of the Notice of Action associated with a law firm in Israel. There is no evidence to suggest that the decision to not name the proposed individual defendants was not a deliberate and a tactical decision made as part of the litigation strategy employed by the Plaintiff's former counsel.</P>
<P>29. The Plaintiff is correct to note that a Notice of Action is intended to be brief with the expectation that the details of the claims made will be expanded upon in the Statement of Claim. However, she fails to acknowledge that the Statement of Claim not only expands upon the details of the claims made in the Notice of Action, but it also raises new allegations under the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering which was not contemplated in the Notice of Action.</P>
<P>30. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hastings v Halton Condo Corp</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Book of Authorities of the Plaintiff (BOAP), <CASEREF><CITE>2013 ONSC 175</CITE></CASEREF>, Tab 1 [<EM>Hastings</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, for example, the plaintiff presented evidence that she specifically instructed her counsel to commence proceedings against various defendants. In preparing the statement of claim, one individual's name was accidentally deleted from the style of cause and the address portion of the statement of claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, at paras 3 and 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, by inadvertence, that individual's name was not shown as a party defendant in the style of cause.</P>
<P>31. In reaching a decision, the court in <EM>Hastings</EM> relied on the fact that the plaintiff had notified the intended defendant of her intention to make a claim against him by writing him a letter prior to the expiration of the limitation period. In doing so, the plaintiff demonstrated that the intended defendant had knowledge that he was an intended defendant <EM>prior to</EM> the issuance of the statement of claim and <EM>prior to</EM> the expiration of the limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, at para 11 and 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. In <EM>Corp. of Township of North Shore v Grant</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2018 ONSC 503</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Township</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, the Court held that regardless of how a request to add or substitute a party is characterized (i.e. be it a &ldquo;technical irregularity&rdquo; or &ldquo;misnomer or misdescription&rdquo;), the jurisprudence is clear that an amendment will be permitted where there is a &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; between a plaintiff's intention to sue and the intended defendant's knowledge of the plaintiff's intention.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, at paras 20 and 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. In the case at bar, the Plaintiff notified the AGC of her intention to amend the Statement of Claim to add the proposed individual defendants <EM>after</EM> the expiry of the limitation period. The Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to show &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; between her intention to sue and the intended defendants' knowledge of that intention in the manner contemplated in <EM>Township</EM>.</P>
<P>34. In <CASEREF><SOC>Dupuis v W.O. Stinson &amp; Son Ltd</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4317</CITE></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>BOAP, Tab 3 [<EM>Dupuis</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, the irregularity was the counsel's failure to attend at court personally to ensure the statement of claim was issued. The plaintiff's counsel learned that the statement of claim had not been issued days later. The court attributed the irregularity to the error of counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, at paras 3-4 and 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The technical irregularity described in <EM>Dupuis</EM> is distinguishable from the circumstances of this case where the Plaintiff has not presented a scintilla of evidence to suggest an error committed by her former counsel.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Plaintiff's allegations against the proposed individual defendants are not tenable at law.</TI>
<P>35. Not only has the limitation period to add the aforementioned individuals as defendants to the action expired the Respondent submits that the Plaintiff's request to add the individual defendants ought to not succeed as the allegations disclose no reasonable cause of action.</P>
<P>36. The following elements must be demonstrated to establish a tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Prinzo v Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care</SOC><CITE>[2002] OJ No 2712</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras 43 and 48.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(i) Flagrant or outrageous conduct;</P1>
<P1>(ii) Calculated to produce harm; and,</P1>
<P1>(iii) Resulting in a visible and provable injury/illness.</P1></P>
<P>37. To establish intentional infliction of mental suffering, the plaintiff must not only show that the defendant ought to have known that harm would occur, but it must be shown that the defendant must have intended to produce the kind of harm that occurred or have known that it was almost certain to occur<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Boucher v Wal-Mart Canada Corp</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 419</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The Plaintiff's Statement of Claim alleges that the conduct forming the basis of the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering occurred while she held her position as Canadian Ambassador to Israel. The period of this appointment was January 2, 2014 to June 30, 2016.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 14, 100 and 104.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. The Plaintiff's claims against the proposed individuals is frivolous and discloses no reasonable cause of action. The Plaintiff's complaint against the proposed individuals can be summarized as follows:
<P1>(i) Mark Gwozdecky allegedly made efforts to &ldquo;sideline&rdquo; the Plaintiff in her position as Ambassador;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 23&ndash;29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(ii) Mark Gwzodecky allegedly &ldquo;threatened&rdquo; the Plaintiff by sending her an article about a former Canadian diplomat being disciplined for concerns about an Official Residence;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at para 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(iii) Daniel Jean allegedly sought to undermine the Plaintiff, make her appear incompetent and strip her of her authority;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(iv) Daniel Jean allegedly told the Plaintiff &ldquo;we can do whatever we want to you&rdquo; on March 26, 2016 in reference to her departure from her position as Ambassador;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 79&ndash;81.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(v) Barbara Richardson conducted an inspection that allegedly targeted the Plaintiff following the summer of 2014;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 43&ndash;45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(vi) Barbara Richardson released an inspection report that allegedly comprised of &ldquo;unfounded, defamatory conclusions regarding the Plaintiffs conduct, leadership and competency&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at para 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(vii) Alex Bugailiskis allegedly instructed the Plaintiff to be dishonest to the media by saying that she was not available for interviews;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 70&ndash;72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(viii) Alex Bugailiskis allegedly engaged in &ldquo;direct, personal attacks of the Plaintiff&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at para 73.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(ix) Katie Telford allegedly &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; direct correspondence from the Plaintiff on two occasions, being June 13, 2016 and June 20, 2016; and,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 114 and 115</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(x) Katie Telford allegedly &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; correspondence from the Plaintiff to the Deputy Minister of Global Affairs on which she was copied.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MRP, Statement of Claim, Tab C, at paras 113-114.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>40. The allegations made by the Plaintiff do not rise to the level of &ldquo;flagrant and outrageous&rdquo; conduct. The Plaintiff has failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of being &ldquo;sidelined&rdquo;, &ldquo;threatened&rdquo;, &ldquo;undermined&rdquo; or suffering &ldquo;personal attacks&rdquo;. The Plaintiff makes bold allegations that are devoid of any particulars. The Plaintiff has also failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of suffering any injury or illness as a result of the alleged flagrant or outrageous conduct.</P>
<P>41. Under Rule 26.01, the proposed amended pleading must be legally tenable and disclose a cause of action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Plante v Industrial Alliance Life Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>[2003] OJ No 3034</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Respondent submits that the Plaintiff's allegations against the proposed individual defendants based on the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering are not legally tenable and disclose no reasonable cause of action when considering the test to be applied to establish the tort.</P>
<P>42. While the Plaintiff alleges that she suffered a visible and provable injury as a result of the proposed individual defendants' flagrant and outrageous conduct that were calculated to harm her, she does not plead any material facts as to what visible and provable injury she has suffered nor does she plead any facts regarding when she suffered these alleged injuries.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
