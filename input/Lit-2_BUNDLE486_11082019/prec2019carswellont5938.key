<BLOCK1><TI>CLAIM</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiffs MDS Inc. and MDS (Canada) Inc. c.o.b. MDS Nordion claim as against the Defendants for:
<P1>(a) a declaration that MDS Inc. and MDS (Canada) Inc. c.o.b. MDS Nordion are entitled to full indemnity for all losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by them due to the cessation of the supply of radioisotopes resulting from the shutdown of the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (&ldquo;AECL&rdquo;) Nuclear Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River, Ontario (the &ldquo;Reactor&rdquo;) covering the period from May 14, 2009 to August 17, 2010 under a policy of property insurance (Policy No. SU400) issued by the Defendant Factory Mutual Insurance Company c.o.b. FM Global (&ldquo;FM Global&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) damages in the amount of $125,000,000;</P1>
<P1>(c) interest at commercial borrowing rates applicable from May 14, 2009 to August 17, 2010;</P1>
<P1>(d) costs of this action on a substantial indemnity basis;</P1>
<P1>(e) pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, as appropriate, pursuant to the provisions of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, and all amendments thereto;</P1>
<P1>(f) its costs of this action;</P1>
<P1>(g) such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE PARTIES</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. MDS Nordion, a division of the Plaintiffs, MDS Inc. and MDS (Canada) Inc. (&ldquo;MDS&rdquo;) is a global health science company that provides market leading products and services used for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. MDS' products and services are used on a daily basis by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, medical device manufacturers, hospitals, clinics and research laboratories. MDS has a well-diversified global base of over 650 customers who count on MDS to supply radioisotopes for cardiac imaging, targeted cancer treatments and sterilization of medical products.</P>
<P>3. The Defendant Factory Mutual Insurance Company c.o.b. FM Global is a mutual insurance company incorporated under the Ontario <EM>Corporations Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 38. FM Global is licensed to provide insurance under the Ontario <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, as amended, and has a corporate office located at 165 Commerce Valley Drive West, Suite 500, Thornhill, Ontario L3T 7V8.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE INSURANCE COVERAGE</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. FM Global is an international insurer with a focus on providing property insurance coverage. FM Global specializes in the identification of specific risks, that, if occasioned may critically affect an insured's property and overall business. They have done so in this instance.</P>
<P>5. FM Global provided a comprehensive property insurance policy to MDS (Policy No. SU400) (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) covering the period from November 1, 2008 to November 1, 2009, and as renewed. The Policy provided coverage against loss resulting from certain perils to property owned by MDS. Pursuant to Section C, the Time Element Coverages, and the Time Element Coverage Extensions, the Policy also provided coverage for the actual business loss sustained by MDS as a result of certain losses caused to property not owned by MDS, but forming part of MDS' critical supply chain.</P>
<P>6. At the time the coverage was underwritten, FM Global was aware of the nature of MDS's business, and that the medical radioisotopes resold by MDS as part of its business operations were supplied by AECL from the Reactor owned and operated by AECL at its Chalk River facility, as set out below.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MDS AND AECL</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Pursuant to an Agreement dated February 21, 2006, MDS entered into an exclusive supply relationship for radioisotopes produced by AECL at its Reactor in Chalk River, Ontario. MDS's business involved the purchase of such radioisotopes for processing and sale to its customers worldwide for profit. The radioisotopes purchased and sold by MDS included Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), Xenon-133 (Xe-133), Iodine-125 (I-125) and Iodine-131 (I-131).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE LOSS</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. The Reactor's core is housed within a structure known as the calandria. The calandria is surrounded by a light water reflector, both of which are housed within the concrete shielding structure. The calandria and the light water reflector are separated by a narrow compartmentalized area, running the height of the calandria, and known as the J-rod annulus. The J-rod annulus is pressurized with C02 to purge ambient air from the space.</P>
<P>9. On our about May 14, 2009, the Reactor experienced a shut down which was caused by a spontaneous leak of water from the interior of the calandria into the surrounding J-rod annulus, causing physical loss or damage to the J-rod annulus. As a result of the water leak, the Reactor was shut down.</P>
<P>10. In spite of ongoing attempts to repair the Reactor, the Reactor remained in shut-down until it was restarted on August 17, 2010. Accordingly, AECL was unable, between May 14, 2009 and August 17, 2010, to supply MDS with any radioisotopes pursuant to the Agreement.</P>
<P>11. As a result of the inability of AECL to supply radioisotopes to MDS for processing and sale, MDS suffered substantial financial losses.</P>
<P>12. Based on its average monthly sales prior to the loss, and accounting for changes in the market price of isotopes during the 15 month reactor shut-down, MDS's lost gross revenues from the sale of radioisotopes during that period were as follows:

<P>14. Accounting for $4.3 million in variable costs associated with the sale of the radioisotopes, the actual loss sustained by MDS during the 15 month reactor shut-down was $79.2 million.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE LOSS FALLS WITHIN COVERAGE UNDER THE POLICY</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. The Policy is an &ldquo;all-risks&rdquo; property policy, which provides coverage to MDS against all risks of physical loss or damage falling within coverage under the Policy, and not otherwise excluded. This is set out in the insuring agreement, which provides:
<QUOTE><P>In consideration of the terms and conditions herein or added hereto and in consideration of the premium paid, this Company agrees to insure the property described in the attached terms and conditions against All Risks of Physical Loss or Damage except as excluded in the attached terms and conditions commencing with the effective date shown above.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. The FM Global policy provided, pursuant to Section C, for certain Time Element Coverages and Time Element Coverage Extensions. These provisions of the Policy were intended to provide coverage for the actual loss sustained by MDS which resulted from physical loss or damage to property at a facility owned by any party which formed part of the supply chain for MDS.</P>
<P>17. The Time Element Coverages are set out Section C(1)(a) of the Policy as follows:
<QUOTE><P>&ellipsis;</P>
<BLOCK2><N>1.</N><TI>LOSS INSURED</TI>
<P>A. This Policy insures TIME ELEMENT loss, as provided in the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES, directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured by this Policy:
<P1>1) to property described elsewhere in this Policy and not otherwise excluded by this Policy or otherwise limited in the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES below;</P1>
<P1>2) used by the Insured, or for which the Insured has contracted use;</P1>
<P1>3) located at an Insured Location or within 1,000 feet of it, or as provided as TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF PROPERTY or OFF PREMISES STORAGE FOR PROPERTY UNDER CONSTRUCTION; or</P1>
<P1>4) while at a MISCELLANEOUS PERSONAL PROPERTY Location and such Location is not a Contingent Time Element Location; or</P1>
<P1>5) while in transit as provided by this Policy, and</P1>
<P1>6) during the Periods of Liability described in this section.</P1></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The particular loss in question falls within coverage under the Section C(3)(B) of the Policy, the Contingent Time Element Coverage Extensions:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>3.</N><TI>TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSIONS</TI>
<P>This Policy also insures TIME ELEMENT loss, as provided by the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES of this Policy, for the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSIONS described below.</P>
<P><BOLD>SUPPLY CHAIN TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSIONS</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>CONTINGENT TIME ELEMENT EXTENDED</TI>
<P>This Policy covers the Actual Loss Sustained and EXTRA EXPENSE incurred by the Insured during the PERIOD OF LIABILITY directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured to property of the type insured at Contingent Time Element Locations located within the TERRITORY of this Policy.</P>
<P>1) As respects CONTINGENT TIME ELEMENT EXTENDED:
<P1>a) The Insured will influence and cooperate with the Contingent Time Element Location in every way and take any reasonable and necessary action, including the use of other machinery, supplies or locations, to effect mitigation of the loss payable hereunder.</P1>
<P1>b) In determining the indemnity payable hereunder, the Company will consider the amount of income derived before the date of physical loss or damage and the probable amount of income after the date of loss or damage.</P1>
<P1>c) TIME ELEMENT EXCLUSIONS C does not apply.</P1></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>3) References and Application. The following term(s) wherever used in this Policy means:
<P1><UNDER>a) Contingent Time Element Location:</UNDER>
<P2><UNDER>(i) Any Location:</UNDER>
<P3><UNDER>(a) of a direct customer, supplier, contract manufacturer or contract service provider to the Insured.</UNDER></P3>
<P3>(b) of any company under a royalty, licensing fee or commission agreement with the Insured.</P3></P2>
<P2>(ii) Any Location of a company that is a direct or indirect customer, supplier, contract manufacturer or contract service provider to a Location described in a)(i) above.</P2>
<P2>(iii) A Contingent Time Element Location does not include Locations of any company directly or indirectly supplying to, or receiving from, the Insured, electricity, fuel, gas, water, steam, refrigeration, sewage, voice, data or video.
<P3>[emphasis added]</P3></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. The AECL Reactor qualifies as a Contigent Time Element Location under the Policy, as the AECL Reactor qualifies as property at a location of a direct supplier of MDS.</P>
<P>20. Further, MDS has sustained actual monetary loss as a result of the Reactor shutdown, which was caused by physical loss or damage of the type insured by the Policy which is not otherwise excluded from coverage.</P>
<P>21. MDS is therefore entitled, subject to the limits of coverage provided in the Policy, to indemnity for all of the Actual Loss Sustained by it during the Period of Liability, which is defined in Section C(4)(A)(1) of the Policy:
<QUOTE><P>&ellipsis;</P>
<BLOCK2><N>4.</N><TI>PERIOD OF LIABILITY</TI>
<P>A. The PERIOD OF LIABILITY applying to all TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES, except GROSS EARNINGS, EXTRA EXPENSE and LEASEHOLD INTEREST and as shown below or if otherwise provided under any TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSION, and subject to any Time Limit provided in the LIMITS OF LIABILITY clause in the DECLARATIONS section, is as follows:
<P1>1) The period:
<P2>a) starting from the time of physical loss or damage of the type insured against; and</P2>
<P2>b) ending not later than the period of time shown in the LIMITS OF LIABILITY clause of the DECLARATIONS section,</P2>
during which period the results of the business shall be directly affected by such damage.</P1>
<P1>c) not to be limited by the expiration of this Policy.</P1></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>22. As the Reactor was unable to produce radioistopes for supply by AECL to MDS until its start-up on August 17, 2010, MDS was directly affected by such damage and MDS is accordingly entitled to indemnity under the Policy for all actual loss sustained by it between May 14, 2009 and August 17, 2010.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE LOSS WAS REPORTED TO FM GLOBAL</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. Following discovery of the loss, and in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Policy, MDS reported the loss to FM Global on May 22, 2009.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>FM GLOBAL IS IN BREACH OF CONTRACT</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. To date, FM Global has admitted that:
<P1>A. The Policy was in full force and effect at the time of the loss;</P1>
<P1>B. The loss occurred at a &ldquo;Contingent Time Element Location&rdquo; as defined in the Policy;</P1>
<P1>C. The damaged Reactor qualifies as property of a type insured by the Policy;</P1>
<P1>D. No action or inaction by MDS caused or contributed to the loss;</P1>
<P1>E. The loss was reported to FM Global in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Policy.</P1></P>
<P>25. To date, in breach of the terms and conditions of the contract (the Policy), FM Global has refused to indemnify MDS for the Actual Loss Sustained by it, and which is properly the subject of coverage under the Policy. Further, FM Global has anticipatorally breached the terms of the contract by advising MDS that it does not intend to indemnify MDS for the Actual Loss Sustained by it under the Policy.</P>
<P>26. MDS will provide the full particulars of all losses, damages and expenses sustained by it prior to the trial of this matter.</P>
<P>27. The Plaintiff pleads and relies upon the provisions of the following:
<P1>(a) <EM>The Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8;</P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>The Negligence Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c.N.1.;</P1>
<P1>(c) <EM>The Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c.C. 43,</P1>
and all amendments thereto.</P>
<P>28. MDS proposes that this action be tried in the City of Toronto.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> STATEMENT OF DEFENCE</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant, Factory Mutual Insurance Company (&ldquo;FMIC&rdquo;), admits the allegation set out in paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>2. Except as specifically admitted herein, FMIC denies that the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim, denies the allegations set out in the Statement of Claim, and put the Plaintiffs to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>3. FMIC is a duly incorporated and licensed insurance company, which carries on business as underwriter of property insurance policies. FMIC carries on business using the name and style of FM Global.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE POLICY</TI>
<P>4. FMIC issued Policy No. SU400 to MDS effective for the policy period of November 1, 2008 to November 1, 2009 (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;). The Policy provides coverage for real and personal property owned by MDS, and located at an Insured Location or within 1,000 feet thereof, against all risk of physical loss or damage except as expressly excluded in the Policy. The Policy also provides certain prescribed Time Element Coverages for Time Element losses directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured by the Policy.</P>
<P>5. FMIC denies that the Plaintiffs are entitled to indemnification under the terms of the Policy for the claims and damages as alleged in the Statement of Claim and put the Plaintiffs to the strict proof thereof. FMIC pleads and relies upon the declarations, insuring agreements, limitations, exclusions, definitions, conditions and terms of the Policy, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, specifically relies upon the following provisions:
<QUOTE><BLOCK1><TI>PROPERTY DAMAGE&mdash;SECTION B</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>1.</N><TI>PROPERTY INSURED</TI>
<P>This Policy insures the following property, unless otherwise excluded elsewhere in this Policy, located at an Insured Location or within 1,000 feet thereof, to the extent of the interest of the Insured in such property.</P>

<P>B. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from any of the following regardless of any other cause or event, whether or not insured under this Policy, contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss:
<P1>1) nuclear reaction or nuclear radiation or radioactive contamination.
<P2>However:</P2>
<P2>&ellipsis;</P2>
<P2>b) this Policy does insure physical damage directly caused by sudden and accidental radioactive contamination, including resultant radiation damage, from material used or stored or from processes conducted on the Insured Location, provided that on the date of loss, there is neither a nuclear reactor nor any new or used nuclear fuel on the Insured Location.</P2>
<P2>&ellipsis;</P2></P1></P>
<P>C. This Policy excludes the following, but, if physical damage not excluded by this Policy results, then only that resulting damage is insured:
<P1>&ellipsis;</P1>
<P1>3) deterioration, depletion, rust, corrosion or erosion, wear and tear, inherent vice or latent defect.</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI>THE NRU</TI>
<P>6. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (&ldquo;AECL&rdquo;) operates a Nuclear Research Universal reactor (&ldquo;NRU&rdquo;) at its Chalk River facilities. The NRU was designed starting in 1949 and first went critical (self-sustained nuclear reaction) on November 3, 1957. The NRU is a natural-uranium, heavy-water-moderated and heavy-water-cooled research reactor. The core of the NRU reactor is approximately 3-meters wide and 3-meters high and housed within an aluminum structure known as the &ldquo;calandria&rdquo;. This large volume enables the bulk production of radioactive isotopes (&ldquo;radioisotopes&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. The calandria is surrounded by a light water reflector that is physically separated from the calandria by a narrow compartmentalized area running the height of the calandria and referred to as the &ldquo;J-rod annulus&rdquo;. The J-rod annulus is pressurized with CO2 to purge ambient air from the J-rod annulus. The NRU is also equipped with a sump system located at the bottom of the J-rod annulus to automatically collect and remove any water which may enter into the J-rod annulus. Access to the J-rod annulus is from the top, or deck plate, of the NRU through small openings approximately 10 centimeters in diameter.</P>
<P>8. When heavy water is exposed to neutron radiation, a radioactive isotope known as Tritium is produced. In the event irradiated heavy water enters into the J-rod annulus, a certain amount of Tritium is released into the ventilation system. AECL monitors the amount of Tritium released from the NRU into the ventilation system to ensure the levels do not pose a threat to the safety of AECL workers or the environment and as a means of detecting heavy water discharges into the J-rod annulus.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE LEAK</TI>
<P>9. On Thursday, May 14, 2009 a power outage resulted in the automatic trip and safe shutdown of the NRU. AECL initially anticipated that this shutdown would last about 36 hours. During this shutdown period, increased levels of Tritium were observed through routine monitoring of the ventilation streams indicating that heavy water was leaking from the calandria into the J -rod annulus. Although any heavy water discharged into the J-rod annulus is collected and removed from the J-rod annulus by the sump system, a small amount of the heavy water evaporates before it can be collected resulting in the release of Tritium into the ventilation system. AECL determined that the leak was occurring at the rate of about 5 kg per hour (or roughly one drop per second) and likely had been occurring for several hours prior to the power outage.</P>
<P>10. AECL subsequently conducted a video inspection of the external wall of the calandria and, by May 18, 2009, was able to locate the source of the leak at the base of the calandria in a location where corrosion was present. AECL also determined that there were additional corrosion points in other areas on the outer wall of the calandria &ldquo;localized corrosion&rdquo;) and &ldquo;significant wall thinning&rdquo; (&ldquo;general corrosion&rdquo;) in the area of the leak.</P>
<P>11. In respect of the localized corrosion, the NRU had been experiencing chronic leakage from the light water reflector into the J-rod annulus, and a lip on the light water reflector designed to keep &ldquo;reflector leakage&rdquo; from reaching the wall of the calandria had corroded allowing light water to contact the calandria wall. Air ingress into the J-rod annulus, despite the CO2 purging, allowed for the formation of nitric acid which, in conjunction with the moisture from the light water, caused the localized corrosion of the aluminum calandria. <UNDER>AECL subsequently determined that the nitric acid was produced when air inside the annulus was irradiated creating nitrogen oxide (a process referred to as radiolysis or the disassociation of molecules by nuclear radiation) and the nitrogen oxide dissolved in the water to form nitric acid.</UNDER></P>
<P>12. AECL was aware that the general corrosion of the calandria wall was a continuous and ongoing process that had been occurring for a number of years prior to May 14, 2009.</P>
<P>13. On June 2, 2009, AECL announced its decision to defuel and drain the NRU in order to complete its investigation of the extent of the &ldquo;localized corrosion&rdquo; and &ldquo;general corrosion&rdquo;, and devise and implement a methodology to repair the corrosion damage. On or before June 24, 2009, the heavy water level in the calandria had been drawn down to about 1.2 metres and the leakage rate into the J-rod annulus reduced to about .5 kg. per hour. Again, any heavy water discharged into the J-rod annulus was continuously collected and removed by the sump system. By July 22, 2009, the calandria had been completely drained and the leak stopped.</P>
<P>14. The NRU remained shut down throughout the period of time it took to investigate and determine that the cause of the heavy water leak into the J-rod annulus was localized corrosion, devise a methodology to repair the corrosion damage, and subsequently complete the repair/remediation of the corrosion damage. The NRU was returned to operation following completion of these repairs on August 17, 2010.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>POLICY APPLICATION</TI>
<P>15. Subject to the express terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions, the Policy affords coverage against &ldquo;all risks&rdquo; of physical loss or damage to &ldquo;<BOLD>insured property</BOLD>&rdquo; while &ldquo;<BOLD>located at an Insured Location or within 1,000 feet thereof</BOLD>&rdquo;. FMIC pleads, and the fact is, that the NRU does not constitute property located at an &ldquo;Insured Location&rdquo; as defined in the Policy. Accordingly, the Policy does not provide coverage for any direct physical loss or damage to the NRU itself.</P>
<P>16. Pursuant to clause 3.B. of Section C of the Policy, &ldquo;Contingent Time Element Extended&rdquo; coverage is afforded to MDS for the &ldquo;Actual Loss Sustained&rdquo; during the &ldquo;Period of Liability&rdquo; <BOLD>directly resulting</BOLD> from physical loss or damage <BOLD>of the type insured</BOLD> to property of the type insured at &ldquo;Contingent Time Element Locations&rdquo;, subject to a Limit of Liability of US $25,000,000 per occurrence and application of a US $100,000 per occurrence deductible. FMIC concedes that the NRU constitutes property of the type insured under the Policy located at a Contingent Time Element Location within the meaning of the Policy.</P>
<P>17. FMIC denies that any of the losses allegedly sustained by MDS as the result of the shutdown of the NRU <BOLD>directly result</BOLD> from any <BOLD>physical loss or damage of the type insured</BOLD> under the Policy to the NRU and puts MDS to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>18. FMIC pleads that the release of radioactive Tritium into the ventilation system was a causal or contributing factor to the NRU shutdown. <UNDER>FMIC further pleads that the local corrosion which caused the leak of heavy water from the calandria into the J-Rod annulus was itself caused or contributed to by the formation of nitric acid as a result of the disassociation of air molecules by nuclear radiation. Consequently, FMIC</UNDER> pleads that any loss or damage &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; caused by or resulting from the release of the radioactive Tritium <UNDER>and/or the irradiation of air inside the J-rod annulus</UNDER>&mdash;regardless of any other cause or event, insured or uninsured, contributing concurrently or in any other sequence&mdash;is expressly excluded from coverage under the Policy pursuant to exclusion 5.B.1) in Section B of the Policy.</P>
<P>19. FIMC further pleads that the only physical damage detected by AECL after thorough investigation of the NRU consisted of the known and ongoing general corrosion of the calandria, and the localized corrosion of the calandria wall and light water reflector lip. FMIC pleads that such &ldquo;corrosion&rdquo; is expressly excluded from coverage under the Policy pursuant to exclusion 5.C. 3) in Section B of the Policy.</P>
<P>20. FMIC denies that the discharge of the small amounts of heavy water into the J-rod annulus, and/or the temporary presence of these small amounts of heavy water in the J-rod annulus, constitutes resultant physical damage within the meaning of the excepting wording to exclusion 5.C. 3) in Section B of the Policy. FMIC pleads that the discharge of heavy water into the J-rod annulus did not cause any physical damage to the J-rod annulus requiring repairs due to contact with or exposure to the heavy water, and any heavy water discharged into the J-rod annulus was continuously being removed by the NRU sump system.</P>
<P>21. In the alternative, if the discharge of the small amounts of heavy water into the J-rod annulus, and/or the temporary presence of these small amounts of heavy water in the J-rod annulus, constitutes resultant physical damage within the meaning of the excepting wording to exclusion 5.C.3) in Section B of the Policy, which is not admitted but specifically denied, FMIC denies that any of the losses allegedly sustained by MDS were the <BOLD>direct result</BOLD> of such resultant physical damage.</P>
<P>22. FMIC pleads that the losses allegedly sustained by MDS <BOLD>directly resulted</BOLD> from the decision to shut down the NRU, and duration of time the NRU remained shut down, in order to inspect for the cause of the heavy water leak&mdash;determined to be corrosion damage&mdash;and to devise and implement a methodology to repair/remediate the corrosion damage. The NRU was not shutdown in order to remove the small amounts of heavy water from the J-rod annulus, which removal was occurring continuously and at the same time that the NRU was required to remain shut down while AECL was inspecting for corrosion damage and devising and implementing a methodology to repair/remediate the corrosion damage. Accordingly, FMIC pleads and relies upon exclusion 5.A. in Section C of the Policy.</P>
<P>23. In the further alternative, if any of the losses alleged by MDS directly resulted from the discharge of the small amounts of heavy water into the J-rod annulus, and/or the temporary presence of these small amounts of heavy water in the J-rod annulus, and are not excluded by operation of exclusion 5.A. in Section C of the Policy, which is not admitted but denied, FMIC denies that the &ldquo;results&rdquo; of MDS's business were &ldquo;directly affected&rdquo; by the discharge of the small amounts of heavy water into the J-rod annulus, and/or the temporary presence of these small amounts of heavy water in the J-rod annulus, throughout the entire 15-month duration of the NRU shutdown. FMIC pleads, and the fact is, that all heavy water discharges into the J-rod annulus ceased, and any heavy water present in the J-rod annulus removed, on or before July 22, 2009 when the calandria had been completely drained and the leak stopped.</P>
<P>24. FMIC further pleads that the claims and alleged damages for which MDS seeks indemnification under the Policy are excessive and remote and that MDS has failed to take any or adequate steps to mitigate same.</P>
<P>25. FMIC therefore submits that this claim be dismissed with costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</P>

<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY</TI>
<P>1. Except where hereinafter expressly admitted, the plaintiff denies all of the allegations contained in the Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>2. In response to paragraphs 9 through 14 of the Statement of Defence, the plaintiff admits that a leak of heavy water from the NRU reactor vessel was discovered between May 14, 2009 and May 18, 2009, resulting in the shutdown of the NRU reactor.</P>
<P>3. However, contrary to paragraph 11 of the Statement of Defence, the leak of light water was not of the type that caused the shut down of the NRU reactor.</P>
<P>4. Further, A.E.C.L. was not aware of general corrosion of the calandria wall from which the heavy water leak occurred, as is set out in paragraph 12 of the Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>5. The NRU reactor is properly described as a &ldquo;swimming pool reactor&rdquo; in that the react or core is submerged in a pool of heavy water, which operates as a cooling and control mechanism or moderator of the neutrons produced within the reactor. Indeed, the heavy water is an integral part of the cooling mechanism that is built into the reactor structure.</P>
<P>6. All nuclear facilities and structures are subject to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Committee's (CNSC) control, regulation and oversight. The primary obligation of the CNSC is public safety. This mandate requires that all nuclear operators are required to report any incident that might impact public safety. The loss of the heavy water from the NRU reactor in May, 2009 was clearly such a reportable event, given its significant role as a coolant/moderator.</P>
<P>7. Low level tritium emissions that were vented to the atmosphere were an on-going and regular aspect of the operation of the NRU. When such levels exceeded the expected levels (the action level) they signalled the presence of a leak of heavy water and required an investigation and a report to be made to the CNSC. The presence of tritium and heavy water do not constitute a nuclear reaction or nuclear radiation or radioactive contamination, as set out in section 5(B)(1) of the policy.</P>
<P>8. In response to paragraph 18 of the Statement of Defence, the plaintiffs deny that exclusion 5(B)(1) applies, in that the loss in question was not caused directly or indirectly by nuclear reaction or nuclear radiation or nuclear contamination, nor did same contribute concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss. The presence of tritium in the J-rod annulus was not the source of the loss, but merely the route by which the loss was identified. The loss was due to the presence of heavy water in the J-rod annulus, which constitutes a covered loss under the policy.</P>
<P>9. In specific response to paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Statement of Defence, MDS states that the presence of &ldquo;heavy water&rdquo; in the J-rod annulus, a location where same would not normally be expected in quantity, nor where it should be present in quantity, falls within coverage under the policy as:
<P1>a. This event constitutes physical loss or damage to the J-rod annulus as that term is used in the policy and any and/or all of the damages claimed by the plaintiffs have resulted directly from such physical loss or damage; or</P1>
<P1>b. This constitutes resultant physical damage not otherwise excluded by the policy. Pursuant to Article 5(C) of the policy, which provides as follows, the damages claimed by the plaintiffs have resulted directly from such resultant physical loss or damage:
<QUOTE><P>5. C. This Policy excludes the following, but, if physical damage not excluded by this Policy results, then only that resulting damage is insured:</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>c. Pursuant to the time element coverage extensions, the results of MDS' &ldquo;business&rdquo; were &ldquo;directly affected&rdquo; by this physical loss or damage, as required by the terms and conditions of the policy, specifically the period of liability as defined in section C-4(A)(i) of the policy.</P1></P>
<P>10. As a result of the discovery of the leak of &ldquo;heavy water&rdquo; in or about May 14 to 18, 2009, the CNSC would not permit the restarting of the reactor until the source of the leak was identified and repairs were completed.</P>
<P>11. The plaintiff admits:
<P1>(a) that, as pleaded in paragraph 13 of the Statement of Defence, the Calandria had been drained of heavy water by July 22, 2009, and that by doing so the leaking of heavy water into the J-rod annulus stopped on that date, and;</P1>
<P1>(b) that, as pleaded in paragraph 23 of the Statement of Defence, the period over which the &ldquo;results&rdquo; of MDS's business were &ldquo;directly affected&rdquo; by this leak of heavy water continued, at a minimum, to July 22, 2009;</P1>
but states, that such losses and damages continued and are covered by the defendant's policy until the completion of the repairs to the NRU reactor.</P>
<P>12. Such repairs were not completed to the satisfaction of the CNSC until August 17, 2010. Accordingly, the plaintiff's damages were directly caused by, or in the alternative, the results of the plaintiff's &ldquo;business&rdquo; were &ldquo;directly affected by&rdquo; the shutdown during that period pursuant to t he terms and conditions of the policy.</P>
<P>13. In response to the whole of the Statement of Defence, the plaintiffs' state that the defendants were at all material times also the physical property insurers for AECL, the owners of the NRU reactor. As such, the defendants were permitted to, and did in fact, perform numerous routine inspections of the NRU reactor in order to assess the risk and received on-going reports from A.E.C.L. as to the general conditions of the NRU facility. As such, the defendants were well aware of the history of the reactor, including the various leaks, and as such, were at least as knowledgeable and/or more knowledgeable than the plaintiffs with respect to its operating history and operating issues.</P>
<P>14. Being fully aware of the NRU's history, including its operating issues and a prior heavy water leak of December 5, 2008, the defendants nonetheless agreed to accept a substantial premium from the plaintiffs in order to insure the very risks which transpired as a result of the May, 2009 shutdown of the NRU reactor and its subsequent repair.</P>
<P>15. It is submitted that it would be inequitable in such circumstances, particularly where the injury, loss or damage suffered by the plaintiffs falls within the terms and conditions of the policy, for the defendants to deny coverage for same.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF DEVEN CHEN</TI>
<P>I, DEVEN CHEN, of City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:
<P1>1. I am a Legal Assistant working for Darryl Singer, Barrister and Solicitor, lawyer for the Plaintiff. I have knowledge of the facts to which I hereinafter depose.</P1>
<P1>2. On October 22, 2010, our office issued the Statement of Claim which named ALICE LOHR, as that was the name of the driver provided on the Motor Vehicle Accident Report from Toronto Police Services. A copy of the issued claim and the police report are attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>3. On April 1, 2011, our office was informed by Rohit Sethi, the Legal Counsel acting for Lohr Builders Limited, that ARCHIE LOHR was in fact the driver of the vehicle rather than ALICE LOHR and that the Motor Vehicle Accident Report provided by Toronto Police Service was incorrect. A copy of the correspondence is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>4. Now that we have knowledge of the true identity of the driver, we must amend the Statement of Claim by replacing ALICE LOHR with ARCHIE LOHR as a Defendant. A copy of the proposed amended Statement of Claim is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>5. On April 27, 2011, our office received the Notice that Action Will Be Dismissed from the court dated April 21, 2011. A copy of the Notice is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>6. On May 9, 2011, Darryl Singer was able to obtain a verbal consent to amend the Statement of Claim and extending time to file Statement of Defence from Mr. Sethi by telephone.</P1>
<P1>7. However, in order to protect our client's rights, we need to bring this motion. Accordingly, we seek an Order extending the time for filing a Statement of Defence to November 15, 2011 and an Order to amend the Statement of Claim by replacing ALICE LOHR with ARCHIE LOHR as a Defendant. There is no prejudice to the Defendants and the insurer is aware of and does not oppose to this motion.</P1>
<P1>8. I make this Affidavit for the aforesaid Order and for no other or improper purpose.</P1></P>

<P><BOLD>THE PLAINTIFFS</BOLD> will make a motion to the Court in writing seeking an Order setting aside the administrative dismissal of this action, without costs, at the Court House, 393 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING</BOLD>: The motion is to be heard in writing.</P>
<P><BOLD>THIS MOTION IS FOR</BOLD>:</P>
<P>1. An Order setting aside the Order Dismissing Action for Delay dated August 21, 2013;</P>
<P>2. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just and proper.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD>
<P1>1. Rules 1, 2, 3, 16, 48.14, and 37.14 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P1>
<P1>2. A Status Notice with respect to this action was received by the parties on May 13, 2013.</P1>
<P1>3. The materials for the Status Hearing, including Status Hearing Request Form, Affidavit of Service, and a copy of our fax confirmation sheet with said material to opposing counsel, were filed with the Toronto Court in person by an employee of Dutton Brock LLP, Andrew Williams, on July 25, 2013, well within the prescribed 90 days deadline of the Status Notice.</P1>
<P1>4. On August 21, 2013, the Registrar dismissed the action for delay under Rule 48.14.</P1>
<P1>5. On August 26, 2013, Mr. Andrew Williams, attended the Court in person to file the materials for the Status Hearing again and to inquire about the reason for the administrative dismissal given the fact that materials had been filed on time. The Court advised him that the Court does not accept materials in person and/or over the counter, despite earlier advising us to file our materials over the counter. Mr. Williams was also advised on this day that the Court had lost the materials originally filed by Mr. Williams on July 25, 2013.</P1>
<P1>6. It was always the intent of the parties to have this matter heard and be moved forward with all undue delay and expediency through the courts.</P1>
<P1>7. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the motion:</P>
<P>1. The Affidavit of Terry Wilson and all exhibits thereto;</P>
<P>2. The pleadings and proceedings herein; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other evidence as this Honourable Court shall admit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF TERRY WILSON</TI>
<P>I, Terry Wilson of the City of Toronto, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a law clerk to Brian J. E. Brock, solicitor for the Plaintiffs, MDS Inc. and MDS (Canada) Inc. c.o.b. MDS Nordian, and, as such, have knowledge of the matters to which I hereinafter depose.</P>
<P>2. This action arises out of the shut-down of the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (&ldquo;AECL&rdquo;) nuclear research universal reactor at Chalk River Ontario on or about May 15, 2009 under Policy No. SU400 issued by the Defendant Factory Mutual Insurance Company c.o.b. FM Global (&ldquo;FM Global&rdquo;). The Plaintiffs served the Statement of Claim on FM Global on or about October 22, 2010. Appended at <BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD> to this Motion Record is a true copy of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. FM Global served its Statement of Defence on the Plaintiffs on November 25, 2011. Appended at <BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD> to this Motion Record is a true copy of the Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>4. Examinations for Discovery are set to be completed on October 31, 2013.</P>
<P>5. The main action will be set down for trial on February 1, 2014.</P>
<P>6. On May 13, 2013, we received a Status Notice from the Court that our action was not on the trial list and that it would be dismissed for delay if we did not set the action down for trial within 90 days. Appended at <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD> to this Motion Record is a true copy of the Status Notice.</P>
<P>7. By way of e-mail, I contacted the Toronto Court on July 24, 2013 and notified them that a Status Hearing Request Form has been prepared and a Timetable has been agreed on with defence counsel. I asked the Court to provide a Status Hearing date in this matter. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is true copy of my e-mail correspondence to the Toronto Court dated July 24, 2013. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of the Timetable, Cover Letter, and Status Hearing Request Form.</P>
<P>8. On July 24, 2013, I received an e-mail response from the Toronto Court advising me to file the Status Hearing Request Form along with our Affidavit of Service at the counter on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> floor at 393 University Avenue. The court advised that, after doing such, we will be advised by mail of the date, time and location of our Status Hearing. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of my e-mail correspondence from the Toronto Court dated July 24, 2013.</P>
<P>9. On July 24, 2013, our office faxed a copy of the Status Hearing Request Form and Timetable to Oblong Digambar Professional Corporation. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Cover Letter to Liblong Digambar Professional Corporation, Affidavit of Service, and the fax confirmation.</P>
<P>10. On July 25, 2013, an employee of Dutton Brock LLP, Andrew Williams, personally attended the Toronto Courthouse and filed with the Court on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> floor as advised, all the necessary documents for the Status Hearing, well within the prescribed 90 day period.</P>
<P>11. On August 21, 2013, we received the Order Dismissing Action for Delay. Appended at <BOLD>Tab 4</BOLD> to this Motion Record is a true copy of the Order Dismissing Action for Delay.</P>
<P>12. By way of e-mail, I contacted the court on August 21, 2013 and notified them that we filed a request for a Status Hearing on July 25, 2013 and asked the court to rescind the Order Dismissing the Action for Delay. The court responded via e-mail on the same day that no request form was filed with the court at any time. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of my e-mail correspondence with the Toronto Court dated August 21, 2013.</P>
<P>13. On August 26, 2013, Mr. Andrew Williams, attended the Court in person to file the materials for the Status Hearing again and to inquire about the reason for the administrative dismissal given the fact that materials had been filed on time. The Court advised him that the Court does not accept materials in person and/or over the counter, despite earlier advising us to file our materials over the counter. Mr. Williams was also advised on this day that the Court had lost the materials originally filed by Mr. Williams on July 25, 2013.</P>
<P>14. On August 27, 2013, by way of e-mail, a Student-at-Law at Dutton Brock LLP, Lida Moazzam, contacted opposing counsel, David E. Liblong requesting his consent to a motion to set aside order dismissing action for delay. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Ms. Moazzam's e-mail to Mr. Liblong dated August 27, 2013.</P>
<P>15. By way of e-mail on August 29, 2013, Mr. David E. Liblong provided his consent to a motion to set aside dismissal order. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Mr. Liblong's e-mail correspondence to Ms. Moazzam dated August 29, 2013. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Mr. Liblong's e-mail correspondence with Ms. Moazzam dated September 11 2013, consenting to the draft Order.</P>
<P>16. I make this Affidavit in support of this motion and for no improper purpose.</P>
