<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS,</BOLD> The Durham Regional Police Services Board, Leon Lynch, John Johnson Allan, Cindi Bradley, Daniel Anthony Denyer, Jim Burrows, Jeff Kennedy, David Kimmerly, And Dianne Jennings, appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the order of the Divisional Court dated February 21, 2018 made at Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS ASK</BOLD> that the order be set aside and an order be granted as follows:</P>
<P>1. Restoring the order of Matheson J. dated November 29, 2016 which dismissed the motion by the Defendants, Attorney General, of Ontario, Michael Hill, and John Scott, for an order dismissing the Appellants' Crossclaim as against them;</P>
<P>2. Awarding costs of this appeal, the motion for leave to appeal to this court, the appeal to the Divisional Court, and the motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, to the Appellants;</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Plaintiff commenced an action for damages allegedly caused by an undercover &ldquo;Mr. Big&rdquo; investigation of which he was the subject, pertaining to an unsolved murder in 1974. The investigation allegedly included, among other things, a scenario referred to in the Statement of Claim as the &ldquo;body dump&rdquo; in which the Plaintiff was made to believe that he was participating in the disposal of a corpse, which would later form the basis for discussions about whether he was involved in the 1974 murder;</P>
<P>2. In addition to the police officers who conducted the investigation, the Plaintiff also sued the Attorney General of Ontario and two Crown Attorneys (collectively the &ldquo;Attorney General Defendants&rdquo;) based on allegedly negligent legal advice provided by the Crown Attorneys to the police during the investigation and prior to commencement of the resulting prosecution for murder. The Plaintiff did not claim for malicious prosecution, however, and did not sue the separate Crown Attorneys who later had carriage of the criminal prosecution;</P>
<P>3. The Appellants crossclaimed against the Attorney General Defendants, alleging among other things that:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;The Crown Attorney's Office was involved from the commencement of the UCO [undercover operation] until its conclusion. This included consultation by the DRPS [Durham Regional Police Service] with respect to the conduct of the UCO and the provision by the Crown of legal advice and guidance with respect to same, on which the DRPS relied in good faith. The Crown also handled preparation of the applications for judicial authorization of covert surveillance. The authorizations lasted for approximately 60 days, and each successive application outlined in detail the investigation that had been conducted up to that time&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;The Crown Attorney's Office, which had been providing approval of proposed scenarios since the inception of the UCO, also approved the &lsquo;body dump&rsquo; scenario following consultation by the DRPS&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;These Defendants state that throughout the investigative and charging process, the investigative methodology and potential charges involving the Plaintiff were reviewed with the Crown Attorney's Office in the context of a solicitor-client relationship. These Defendants state that in proceeding with the investigation and reaching their conclusions that they had reasonable and probable grounds for charging the Plaintiff, these Defendants relied in good faith upon the legal advice and guidance provided by the Crown. To the extent that the Crown provided either improper or inadequate advice, these Defendants could not foresee that any component of the investigation would result in any alleged breach of duty to the Plaintiff or any alleged breach of the Plaintiff's rights&rdquo;;</P1></P>
<P>4. The Attorney General Defendants brought a Rule 21 motion to strike both the Plaintiff's claim and the Appellants' Crossclaim as against them. On November 29, 2016, Matheson J. ordered the Plaintiff's claim struck out as against the Attorney General Defendants, but refused to strike out the Appellants' Crossclaim based on negligent legal advice. In particular, Matheson J. concluded that it was not &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; either that prosecutorial immunity applied to the Crossclaim or that the Crown Attorneys did not owe a duty of care to the police;</P>
<P>5. The Attorney General Defendants brought a motion for, and were granted, leave to appeal to the Divisional Court;</P>
<P>6. By order dated February 21, 2018, the Divisional Court reversed Matheson J.'s order and dismissed the Appellants' Crossclaim as against the Attorney General Defendants;</P>
<P>7. In so ordering, the Divisional Court held: &ldquo;No appellate case has suggested that Crown Attorneys may be liable for negligence based on the legal advice they have provided to the police in the course of an investigation leading to criminal charges&rdquo;. The court further held that &ldquo;policy considerations&rdquo; supported the conclusion that Crown Attorneys should be immune from such claims. Based on the foregoing, the court held that it was &ldquo;not necessary to discuss the second issue&rdquo;, namely, whether it was also plain and obvious that Crown Attorneys could never owe a duty of care to police officers to whom they provide legal advice regarding the conduct of an investigation of an identified suspect;</P>
<P>8. With respect, the Divisional Court made the following errors of law:
<P1>(a) It held that the Crown Attorneys' immunity from the Crossclaim was &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; in the absence of any reported case in Canada, prior to Matheson J.'s decision, which considered (let alone determined) whether a Crown Attorney can be held liable for negligent legal advice provided to the police regarding the conduct of an investigation;</P1>
<P1>(b) It failed to undertake any analysis of the relevant Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence which has delineated the scope of prosecutorial immunity. As developed in the case law, the immunity is a function of the constitutional independence of Crown Attorneys when making decisions about whether and how to prosecute criminal charges. It is not &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; that this immunity would necessarily extend to legal advice regarding a police investigation. That type of involvement has never been suggested by the court to attract constitutional independence or immunity;</P1>
<P1>(c) Although it declined to consider whether any duty of care could exist in the circumstances, it held that broad-based &ldquo;policy considerations&rdquo;&mdash;including &ldquo;the concern that Crown Attorneys will be diverted from their important public duties&rdquo; and a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo;&mdash;buttressed the conclusion that Crown Attorneys should be immune from claims for negligent legal advice provided to police regarding the investigation of a suspect. This approach is contrary to the latest guidance from the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Deloitte &amp; Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of)</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 63</CITE></CASEREF>, that it should only be in &ldquo;rare cases&rdquo; that such policy considerations preclude liability when an individual's negligence causes reasonably foreseeable injury to another individual with whom he or she shares a close and direct relationship. Based on the allegations in this case, there can be no doubt that the Crown Attorneys were in a close and direct relationship with the police officers to whom they provided legal advice, and that harm to the Plaintiff&mdash;for which the police are now being sued&mdash;was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of negligent legal advice regarding the investigative techniques to be used;</P1></P>
<P>9. This court has held that the very high threshold for the moving party on a Rule 21 motion will not be met in the absence of binding case law which &ldquo;establishes definitively&rdquo; that no actionable claim exists;</P>
<P>10. This is the first time that this factual matrix has come before an appellate court in this country. It raises significant questions of law, for which no clear precedent exists;</P>
<P>11. Whereas Matheson J. appropriately left the issue open to be argued and determined on an evidentiary record, the Divisional Court opted to do so on the pleadings alone. It made the final determination that prosecutorial immunity shields Crown Attorneys from any possible claim by the police for legal advice given to the police regarding the conduct of an investigation and on which the police rely in good faith in conducting that investigation. In doing so, the Divisional Court ruled out any future judicial consideration, on a proper evidentiary record, of the novel legal issues that arise in this context;</P>
<P>12. These are issues of significant public importance, with far reaching implications for the assessment of liability in cases where Crown Attorneys and police collaborate in major crime investigations. The Divisional Court erred in law in summarily disposing of these legally novel and complex issues on a pleadings motion under Rule 21;</P>
<P>13. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. Leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario was granted on July 5, 2018 pursuant to s. 6(1)(a) of the Courts of Justice Act and Rule 61.03.1 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS,</BOLD> York Regional Police Service Board and YRP #1 (&ldquo;<BOLD>the YRP Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;), appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the Order of the Divisional Court dated February 21, 2018 made at Toronto, Ontario,</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APELLANTS ASK</BOLD> that the Order be set aside and an Order be granted as follows:</P>
<P>I, Restoring the Order of Matheson J. (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Motion Judge</BOLD>&rdquo;) dated November 29, 2016, dismissing the Crown Defend ants' motion to strike the crossclaim of the Durham Regional Police Services' and corresponding officers' crossclaim (&ldquo;the <BOLD>DRPS Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;), together with the anticipated crossclaim of the YRP Defendants;</P>
<P>2, Awarding costs of the appeal, the motion for leave to appeal to this court, the appeal to the Divisional Court, and the motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court to the Appellants.</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF THE APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>4. The plaintiff's action arises out of the investigation and charging of the plaintiff for the first degree murder of his neighbour, Beverly Smith, The investigation included a &ldquo;Mr. Big&rdquo; operation, which involved officers from the Durham Regional Police Services Board, as well as one YRP Officer, YRP #1, who was on secondment to the DRPS during the investigation. At the criminal the trial judge excluded the plaintiff's confession and the plaintiff was acquitted of the murder charge.</P>
<P>5. The plaintiff subsequently brought a claim for negligent investigation, among other things, against the police officers involved, the DRPS, the YRP, Her Majesty the Queen (on behalf of the Ontario Provincial Police) and the Attorney General Defendants. The plaintiff's claim against the Attorney General Defendants was struck by the Motion Judge and the plaintiff abandoned his appeal in this regard.</P>
<P>6. The DRPS also brought a crossclaim against the Attorney General Defendants, seeking contribution and indemnity against the Attorney General Defendants arising out of the legal advice provided by the Crown Attorneys (Hill and Scott) to the police concerning steps to be taken during the investigation of the plaintiff. While the YRP Defendants have not yet filed a crossclaim against the Attorney General Defendants (the limitation period has bees tolled in this regard pending the outcome of the within appeal), the YRP Defendants have at all times indicated an intention to commence a crossclaim, similar to that of the DRPS Defendants. The Motion Judge has allowed the YKP to bring their claim against the Attorney General Defendants using the crossclaim procedure, rather than by issuing a third party claim.</P>
<P>7. Having struck the plaintiff's claim against the Attorney General Defendants, the Motion Judge struck the DRPS Defendants' claim for contribution against the Attorney General Defendants. She did not, however, strike the claim for indemnity as it was not &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; that the police cannot seek indemnity from the Crown in respect of negligent legal advice received during the course of an investigation.</P>
<P>8. The Attorney General Defendants successfully sought leave to appeal to the Divisional Court arguing, among other things, that the appeal raised issues of general importance with far reaching implications for the potential liability of Crown Attorneys.</P>
<P>9. For reasons released February 21, 2018 (<CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Attorney General of Ontario</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 933</CITE></CASEREF>), the appeal was allowed by the Divisional Court which concluded that the Motion Judge had erred in allowing the crossclaim for indemnity of the DRPS Defendants to continue. The Divisional Court found that it was plain and obvious that the DRPS Defendants' crossclaim would fail due to the scope of prosecutorial immunity. Although the Motion Judge had done so, the Divisional Court declined to address whether the allegation that Crown Attorneys have a duty of care in tort to the police had a reasonable prospect of success.</P>
<P>10. With respect, the Divisional Court made the following errors:</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Teston a Rule 21 Motion to Strike</EM></TI>
<P><P1>(a) The Divisional Court erred in failing to apply the appropriate test for considering the tenability of a claim on a motion to Strike, The Divisional Court's decision is premised, in part, on the fact that there is no binding authority suggesting that Crown Attorneys may be liable in negligence based on the legal advice provided to police in the court of an investigation. The novelty of a claim is not determinative on a motion to strike. The approach taken on a motion to strike must be generous and err on the side of per mitting novel, but arguable claims to proceed to trial with the benefit of a full evidentiary record.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>In the Analysis of the&ldquo;Prosecutorial Immunity&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P><P1>(b) The Divisional Court erred in finding that it is plain and obvious that prosecutorial immunity applies to the crossclaim of the DRPS Defendants.</P1>
<P1>(c) The Division Court erred in relying on a so called &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; against the approach&rdquo; to assessing Crown Attorney liability as discussed in <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 170</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Nelles</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), which addressed the issue of whether prosecuting Crown Attorneys enjoyed absolute immunity. In <EM>Nelles</EM>, the Court addressed the propriety of applying a &ldquo;functional approach&rdquo; in the limited context of addressing absolute Crown immunity. The Court rejected the &ldquo;fractional&rdquo; argument on the basis that any action performed maliciously whether or not part of the prosecutorial function should give rise to a claim for malicious prosecution. <EM>Nelles</EM> did not create an all-encompassing &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; against distinguishing between the prosecutorial function of Crown Attorneys and their expanding investigative role advising police.</P1>
<P1>(d) The Divisional Court erred In failing; to address the impact of Hill v. <CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton Wentworth (Regional Minicipality) Regional Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 41</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Hill</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;) on Crown Attorneys and their role in the investigation of a suspect. The Divisional Court decision is irreconcilable with the recognition of a duty of care by police offices to suspects being investigated and creates a void in terms of a suspect's ability to receive compensation in a situation where police rely on the legal advice of a Crown Attorney, therefore meeting the standard of care, and that advice turns out to have been negligent.</P1>
<P1>(e) The Divisional Court erred in finding that there are no countervailing policy concerns that public confidence in the administration of justice will be eroded if Crown Attorneys are not held liable because they have been negligent in providing legal advice. The administration of justice requires that legal advice provided by the Crown Attorneys be held to standard of reasonableness given the importance of the interests at stake. As the Motion Judge aptly stated in her reasons, &ldquo;[t]he provision of competent independent legal advice to the police would, it seems to me, serve the administration of justice. How would legal responsibility for negligent advice interfere?&rdquo;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Absence of a Duty of Care Analysis</EM>:</TI>
<P><P1>(f) The Divisional Court erred in failing to conduct a full <EM>Anns</EM> / <EM>Cooper</EM> analysis to determine whether the allegation that Crown Attorneys have a duty of care in tort to the police has no reasonable prospect of success.</P1>
<P1>(g) Having failed to conduct a full <EM>Anns/Cooper</EM> analysis, and absent a complete evidentiary record, the court erred in finding that broad policy considerations support the conclusion that Crown Attorneys should be immune from claims for negligent legal advice provided to the police in the course of an investigation of a suspect.</P1></P>
<P>11. The appeal raises issues of general public importance relating to whether a Crown Attorney can be held liable for negligent legal advice provided to the police concerning steps taken in the course of an investigation of an individual suspect.</P>
<P>12. In dismissing the appeal, the Divisional Court did not address the apparent conflict its decision creates with respect to the recently recognized tort of negligent investigation as against police officers as compared to the complete immunity provided to Crown Attorneys for their role in an investigation (not prosecution). There is no principled basis on which Crown Attorneys should be treared any differently than police officers in this regard.</P>
<P>13. The issues involved in this case have not previously been addressed by an appellate court. The issues involved have great importance to the public generally and to the administration of justice.</P>
<P>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</P>
<P>14. Leave to appeal from the Divisional Court was granted on July 5, 2018 pursuant to Section 6(i)(a) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 and Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
