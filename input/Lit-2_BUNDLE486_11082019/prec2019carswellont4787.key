<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICATION</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPLICANT MAKES AN APPLICATION FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P>(a) a declaration that the lease agreement between the applicant, 2324702 Ontario Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</BOLD>), as lessee, and the respondent, the 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>), as lessor dated March 1, 2008 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Lease&rdquo;</BOLD>) for the premises municipally located at 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Premises&rdquo;</BOLD>) is in full force and effect;</P>
<P>(b) an order for possession of the Premises;</P>
<P>(c) in the alternative, an order for relief from forfeiture of the Premises and an injunction against the Landlord from interfering with the Tenant's use and occupation of the Premises;</P>
<P>(d) an order dispensing with the time for and/or manner of service and filing of this application; and</P>
<P>(e) the costs of this application on a substantial indemnity basis.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE APPLICATION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. By way of the Lease, the Tenant leased the Premises from 1358023 Ontario Limited (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Former Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>2. By lease amending agreement dated September 5, 2013 the Tenant became the Tenant at the Premises under the Former Landlord. By assignment agreement dated July 21, 2017, the Landlord became the Landlord at the Premises.</P>
<P>3. The Tenant operates a successful restaurant and nightclub business in the Premises.</P>
<P>4. The term of the Lease (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;</BOLD>) commenced on March 1, 2008 and will expire on September 31, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Expiry Date&rdquo;</BOLD>). Pursuant to section 4 of the amending agreement and section 2.02.1 of the Lease, the Tenant has the option of extending the term of the Lease for an additional five (5) years following the Expiry Date.</P>
<P>5. The Tenant has validly exercised its option to renew the Lease in accordance with its terms.</P>
<P>6. Over the Term, the Tenant has made all of its rent payments to the Landlord in full and on time. The Tenant has also regularly provided the Landlord with post-dated cheques for monthly rent payments, which have always been honored by the Tenant.</P>
<P>7. On or around February 1, 2018, the Tenant's bank account was frozen without the Tenant's knowledge or consent. The matter has since been rectified and the Tenant's bank account is now active again. However, as a result of the account freeze, the Landlord was not able to cash the Tenant's rent cheque for February 1, 2018.</P>
<P>8. On February 12, 2018, the Landlord, without notice or warning, changed the locks on the front door of the Premises and left a termination notice on the floor of the Premises inside of the front door. The alleged basis for the actions of the Landlord is that the Tenant has not paid rent for the month of February. 2018.</P>
<P>9. The Tenant did not receive any notice of default from the Landlord and it was therefore not given an opportunity to cure the alleged default.</P>
<P>10. The Tenant was in possession of the Premises at the time of the alleged lease termination and remains in possession of the Premises. The Landlord never retook possession of the Premises.</P>
<P>11. After the Landlord delivered the termination notice, the Tenant informed the Landlord that its account was previously frozen and the problem had since been rectified.</P>
<P>12. The Tenant has made its rent payment for February, 2018 by delivering a cheque to the Landlord's lawyer.</P>
<P>13. The Tenant is therefore fully up to the date on its rent payments for the Premises and the Tenant is ready, willing and able to provide a certified cheque to the Landlord for the February rent payment, if requested.</P>
<P>14. The Tenant is also ready, willing and able to continue paying rent in accordance with the Lease in a timely manner on a going-forward basis.</P>
<P>15. The Tenant employs about 24 employees at the Premises and it hires live entertainment on a weekly basis. The Tenant has also made substantial investment into its business over the past three years and has ongoing business loans which could not be kept up to date if the Tenant is not able to continue operating its business.</P>
<P>16. The Tenant would therefore suffer irreparable harm if the Lease were to be terminated, which would result in a complete loss of the Tenant's business.</P>
<P>17. Sections 97, 98. and 101 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43. as amended.</P>
<P>18. Section 20(1) of the <EM>Commercial Tenancies Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c L.7.</P>
<P>19. Rules 1, 2, 14.05, 37, 40 and 57 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>20. Such further grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE WILL BE USED AT THE HEARING OF THE APPLICATION:</BOLD></P>
<P>(a) The affidavit of Michael Assoon, sworn February 20, 2018; and</P>
<P>(b) Such further evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF MICHAEL ASSOON</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, MICHAEL ASSOON</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto. Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am the principal of the plaintiff, 2324702 Ontario Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</BOLD>) and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except where I have been advised of same, in which case I have identified the source of the information and 1 believe such information to be true.</P>
<P>2. The Tenant operates a successful restaurant and nightclub business in the premises municipally located at 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Premises&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>3. By written Lease agreement dated March 1, 2008 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Lease&rdquo;</BOLD>), 1617514 Ontario Limited, as tenant. Leased the Premises from 1358023 Ontario Limited (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Former Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>). A copy of the Lease is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. By lease amending agreement dated September 5, 2013 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Amending Agreement&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Tenant became the Tenant at the Premises under the Former Landlord. By. assignment agreement dated July 21, 2017, the 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>) became the Landlord at the Premises. A copy of the Amending Agreement is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>5. The term of the Lease (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;</BOLD>) commenced on March 1, 2008 and will expire on September 31, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Expiry Date&rdquo;</BOLD>). Pursuant to section 4 of the Amending Agreement and section 2.02.1 of the Lease, the Tenant has the option of extending the term of the Lease for an additional five (5) years following the Expiry Date.</P>
<P>6. The Tenant has validly exercised its option to renew the Lease in accordance with its terms. However, the Landlord has indicated that it does not want the Tenant to occupy the Premises for an additional term.</P>
<P>7. I assumed control of the Tenant company approximately three years ago and, since that time, the Tenant has made all of its rent payments to the Landlord in full and on time. The Tenant has also regularly provided the Landlord with post-dated cheques for monthly rent payments, which have always been honored by the Tenant.</P>
<P>8. On or around February 1, 2018, the Tenant's bank account was frozen without the Tenant's knowledge or consent. The matter has since been rectified and the Tenant's bank account is now active again. However, as a result of the account freeze, the Landlord was not able to cash the Tenant's rent cheque for February 1, 2018.</P>
<P>9. On February 12, 2018, the Landlord, without notice or warning, changed the locks on the front door of the Premises and left a termination notice on the floor of the Premises inside of the front door. The alleged basis for the actions of the Landlord is that the Tenant has not paid rent for the month of February, 2018. A copy of the Landlord's termination notice is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>10. The Tenant did not receive any notice of default from the Landlord and it was therefore not given an opportunity to cure the alleged default.</P>
<P>11. At the time the front door locks at the Premises were changed, I was inside the Premises working in the kitchen. The Landlord's representative did not enter the Premises at the time to ensure that no one was inside. I was not aware that the front door lock was changed before I found the termination notice on the floor of the Premises.</P>
<P>12. Also, the lock on the back, door to the Premises was not changed and the Tenant therefore was able to continue accessing the Premises from the back door. The Tenant was also able to open the new front door lock from the inside of the Premises without breaking or damaging the lock.</P>
<P>13. As such, the Landlord never re-took possession of the Premises when it purported to terminate the Lease.</P>
<P>14. After receiving the termination notice, Albert Assoon (<BOLD>&ldquo;Albert&rdquo;</BOLD>), another principal of the Tenant immediately contacted Pouneh Rouhani (<BOLD>&ldquo;Rouhani&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Landlord's principal by email and explained that the Tenant's bank account was frozen without the Tenant's knowledge. A copy of my email to Rouhani is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>15. On February 13, 2018, Albert received an email from Julian Binavince (<BOLD>&ldquo;Binavince&rdquo;</BOLD>), the lawyer for the Landlord. The email indicated that the Landlord would be willing to end the purported termination of the Lease and allow the Tenant to continue operating its business from the Premises provided that the Tenant agrees to vacate the Premises on the Expiry Date and forego its right to renew the Lease. A copy of Binavince's email is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>16. On February 15, 2018, Daniel Waldman (<BOLD>&ldquo;Waldman&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Tenant's lawyer, sent a letter to Binavince attaching a cheque for the February, 2018 rental payment. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Waldman's letter.</P>
<P>17. I am advised by Waldman, and do verily believe, that Binavince never informed Waldman that the Landlord would not accept the February rent cheque.</P>
<P>18. The Tenant is therefore fully up to the date on its rent payments for the Premises and the Tenant is ready, willing and able to provide a certified cheque to the Landlord for the February rent payment, if requested.</P>
<P>19. The Tenant is also ready, willing and able to continue paying rent in accordance with the Lease in a timely manner on a going-forward basis.</P>
<P>20. The Tenant employs about 24 employees at the Premises and it hires live entertainment on a weekly basis. The Tenant has also made substantial investment into its business over the past three years and has ongoing business loans which could not be kept up to date if the Tenant is not able to continue operating its business.</P>
<P>21. I do not believe the actions of the Landlord to be reasonable and fair. Specifically, the Tenant should not have to lose its entire business due to one late rent payment.</P>
<P>22. I verily believe that shutting down the Tenant's business at the Premises would also cause hardship to the owners and the Tenant's employees, who rely on the business for employment.</P>
<P>23. The Landlord is in possession of post-dated cheques for the rental payments for the remainder of the term.</P>
<P>24. I swear this affidavit in good faith and for no improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF ROMESH RAJASOORIAR</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>ROMESH RAJASOORIAR</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY (<EM>or</EM> AFFIRM):</P>
<P>1. I was the property manager of the building located at 1305 Dundas West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Building&rdquo;</BOLD>) in the period ending July 2017 and since that time, I continue to do maintenance work at the Building. As such, I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed, except where stated otherwise, in which case I believe that information to be true.</P>
<P>2. My main duty as property manager was to ensure that building systems (H VAC, electrical, plumbing, etc.) was in good working order and to make any needed repairs. I continue to do some maintenance work at the Building for Pouneh Rouhani and/or Lai eh Rouhani, who have advised me that they represent the new owners of the Building.</P>
<P>3. In the period ending July 2017, I assisted the landlord's administrator Marina Sheppard <BOLD>(&ldquo;Ms. Sheppard&rdquo;)</BOLD> in dealing with the tenant in the basement of the Building. In that regard, I dealt primarily with Michael Assoon <BOLD>(&ldquo;Mr. Assoon&rdquo;)</BOLD> as the tenant's representative.</P>
<P>4. From my conversations with Mr. Assoon, I understood Mr. Assoon to be the manager of the nightclub known as Remix, which operates from premises in the basement of the Building (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Nightclub&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P>
<P>5. In the year prior to July 2017,1 was asked several times (at least three times) by Ms. Sheppard to visit Mr. Assoon at the basement premises to collect a bank draft or certified cheque for outstanding rent. Ms. Sheppard told me that the post-dated cheques given to her by the basement tenant were frequently returned NSF and that she would only ask me to visit the tenant if a replacement cheque was not provided within a month or two of the post-dated cheque being returned.</P>
<P>6. Based on my conversations with Ms. Sheppard in the one year period ending July 2017,1 believe that the basement tenant's post-dated cheques with respect to rent were returned by the landlord's bank as NSF more than 4 times.</P>
<P>7. In particular, Ms. Sheppard told me that in the period immediately prior to closing, the arrears with respect to rent payable by the basement tenant was in excess of $20,000.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN COOK</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>JOHN COOK,</BOLD> of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY <EM>(or</EM> AFFIRM<EM>)</EM>:</P>
<P>1. I have resided at the building located at 1305 Dundas West, Toronto (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Building</BOLD>&rdquo;) since 2005 and I have been the superintendent with respect to the 24 apartments on the second and third floor of the Building since March 18, 2011. As such, I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed, except where stated otherwise, in which case I believe that information to be true.</P>
<P>2. In or about July 2017, I commenced reporting to Pouneh Rouhani and Laleh Rouhani with respect to my duties as superintendent and they advised me that they represented the new owners of the Building.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Noise Created by Patrons of the Basement Tenant</TI>
<P>3. I live in an apartment on the second floor of the Building. The windows in my bedroom face Dundas Street and are directly above the main entry/exit of the nightclub known as Remix, which operates from premises in the basement of the Building (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Nightclub</BOLD>&rdquo;). Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> are pictures of the front of the Building take from the north side of Dundas Street and directly in front of the Building.</P>
<P>4. Noise created by people milling around in front of the Building regularly wakes me between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. From what I hear and occasionally see, some people are clearly intoxicated and I have no doubt that these people are patrons of the Nightclub.</P>
<P>5. These disturbances have become more frequent because beginning March 2018, the Nightclub commenced operating every night, whereas prior to March, the Nightclub operated only on weekends.</P>
<P>6. The Building has two other second floor apartments facing Dundas Street and three third floor apartments facing Dundas Street. The residents of these units have complained to me about noise in front of Building late at night/early in the morning.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Other Noise Created by the Nightclub</TI>
<P>7. Other residents have complained about vibrations caused by the Nightclub. In particular, about one week ago, the resident of unit [#omitted] (an apartment that does not face Dundas Street) vacated the Building. He told me that the main reason he was moving was the noise caused by the Nightclub and the state of the front of the Building (described below).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Vomit, Urine and Cigarette Butts</TI>
<P>8. Every morning after the Nightclub has operated, the sidewalk in front of Building and the area around the entry of the Nightclub is littered with cigarette butts. Frequently, there is vomit directly in front of the door of the Building that leads up to the apartments on the second and third floor (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Apartment Access Door</BOLD>&rdquo;) or elsewhere in front of the Building and/or it is obvious from the smell at front of the Building that someone urinated on the front of the Building or on the Apartment Access Door. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a picture of the front of the Building showing the Apartment Access Door.</P>
<P>9. I have no doubt that the vomit and urine was left by patrons of the Nightclub, because the vomit and smell of urine was not present early in the evening before.</P>
<P>10. The &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; signs posted around the front of the Building, copies of which are attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> are frequently removed or vandalized (ripped or burned with cigarettes).</P>
<P>11. The vomit, the cigarette butts and the smell of urine is obvious, but nobody from the Nightclub ever cleans the area in front of the Building and I always have to clean the vomit or wash the area smelling of urine. I now have to clean the cigarette butts away from the Building every day.</P>
<P>12. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a picture of a vomit stain in front of the Building. I discovered the vomit in the morning approximately 1 week ago. I did not clean up the vomit for a few hours, because I wanted to see whether the Nightclub operators would clean it. The Nightclub operators did not clean the vomit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Smokers Obstruct Access to the Apartments</TI>
<P>13. Commencing about 11:30 p.m. on evenings when the Nightclub operates, smoking patrons of the Nightclub congregate in front of the Building, including directly in front of the Apartment Access Door. These congregations of smokers make access to the second and third floor difficult and distasteful, as one must fight through the smokers to get to the Apartment Access Door. The congregations of smokers in front of the Apartment Access Door is thicker in bad weather as the area directly in front of the Apartment Access Door provides some shelter from the elements.</P>
<P>14. I have received several complaints from female residents that some smokers intimidate them to such an extent that they are afraid when entering the Building.</P>
<P>15. The vomit, urine and cigarette butts and congregations of late night smokers have a significant negative impact on my experience living in the Building. As a resident of the Building, I would prefer that the Nightclub cease operating and I have no doubt that the other residents of the Building share my view.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Garbage</TI>
<P>16. The landlord has retained a private contractor to dispose of the garbage generated by the residential tenants (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Residential Garbage</BOLD>&rdquo;) because the configuration of the Building makes the use of the bins supplied by the municipality very difficult. There is no space on the ground floor to store garbage, nor is there an elevator, so garbage is collected in a second floor garbage room and I carry the garbage down the stairs weekly.</P>
<P>17. I put the Residential Garbage out Wednesday evening and Waste Management (the landlord's garbage contractor) collects it early Thursday (by 6:00 a.m.). Occasionally, late Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning, I will notice that garbage has been added to the Residential Garbage.</P>
<P>18. The last such occurrence was on or about March 21-22 and attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> are photographs I took of the garbage added to the Residential Garbage. I left 8 bags of garbage out late Wednesday night and early on Thursday morning, I noticed that another 7 bags had been added, which bags had no &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that one buys from the City of Toronto for garbage collection.</P>
<P>19. The bags that are added to the Residential Garbage are similar (or identical) to the garbage bags put out by the Nightclub operators for collection by the City, except that the bags put out by the Nightclub operators for collection by the City have &ldquo;tags&rdquo;. As such, I believe the Nightclub operators are occasionally disposing of their garbage, at the landlord's cost.</P>
<P>20. I also have noticed that the Nightclub operators throw garbage and other articles at the rear of the Building, blocking fire exits and escape routes. Earlier this year, there was an inspection by the fire department/fire marshall (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Fire Inspection</BOLD>&rdquo;), which resulted in the Nightclub operators cleaning the rear area of the Building, but since that time, the Nightclub operators are again putting garbage and other articles at the back of the Building.</P>
<P>21. In this regard, attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> are photographs taken of the rear area on Wednesday, May 2, 2018. Prior to the Fire Inspection, the area was far more cluttered and after the cleanup by the Nightclub operators, the area was far cleaner. Given my experience with the Nightclub operators, I believe the area will become more cluttered over time.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF POUNEH ROUHANI</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>POUNEH ROUHANI</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY <EM>(or</EM> AFFIRM<EM>)</EM>:</P>
<P>1. I am a principal of the respondent 1305 Dundas Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>) and I share responsibility for tenant matters and management with respect to the building located at 1305 Dundas West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Building&rdquo;</BOLD>). As such, I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed, except where stated otherwise, in which case I believe that information to be true.</P>
<P>2. I reviewed the affidavit of John Cook sworn May 6, 2018 and the affidavit of Romesh Rajjasooriar sworn May 8, 2018 prior to executing this affidavit.</P>
<P>3. In or about July 2017, the Landlord became the owner of the property on which the Building is located (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Property&rdquo;</BOLD>). Since that time, I have received complaints from John Cook and other residential tenants of the Building with respect to the business operated by the basement tenant of the Building. The types of complaints I have received are accurately summarized in the affidavit of Mr. Cook, but the most frequent complaint I receive from residential tenants is about noise. That said, I have seen first hand the area in front of the Building in the morning and find it disgusting. I have no doubt that the nature of the applicant's business (a nightclub) makes the Building less attractive as a home.</P>
<P>4. Given the noise and the physical appearance at the front of the Building, I fear that leasing the ground floor space will be difficult with the applicant operating a nightclub business from the basement premises. The ground floor space was vacant when the Landlord became the owner of the Property and I was advised by the former owner that the ground floor space was vacant in the two years prior to the Landlord acquiring the Property.</P>
<P>5. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of a notice of violation from the City of Toronto Fire Services and attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is reminder from Toronto Hydro with respect to utility arrears of the respondent. The possibility of fines and having to pay utility arrears adds to the stress of having the applicant as a tenant of the Building.</P>
<P>6. With respect to the timeliness of rent payments by the applicant, since the Landlord became the owner of the Property, the applicant has failed to make timely payment of rent on two occasions, the last occasion resulting in the notice of termination being delivered.</P>
<P>7. In the period leading up to the Landlord delivering the notice of termination, I spoke with Said Arazm, a principal of the former owner of the Property, about the applicant. I was prompted to call Mr. Arazm as a result of the complaints being made about the applicant's business.</P>
<P>8. Mr. Arazm advised me that he had frequently had problems with the applicant, predominantly related to late or nonpayment of rent.</P>
<P>9. I spoke with Mr .Arazm on May 8, 2018 to confirm the contents of the affidavit of Rajjasooriar. Mr Arazm confirmed to me that, in the period prior to July 2017, Marina Sheppard primarily dealt with the applicant with respect to rent matters. He confirmed to me that in the one year prior to the sale of the Property to the respondent, the applicant failed to pay rent in a timely manner at least four times and that around the time of the sale of the Property to the Landlord, the applicant was in arrears with respect to its obligation to pay rent.</P>
<P>10. Mr. Arazm could not remember the amount of the applicant's rent arrears that had accumulated around the time of the sale of the Property.</P>
<P>11. The Landlord has not accepted rent since the Landlord's notice of termination was delivered, although there is an interim arrangement negotiated between the lawyers for the Landlord and the applicant so that the application does not need to be dealt with on an urgent basis.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY AFFIDAVIT OF ALBERT ASSOON (SWORN JULY 16<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018)</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, ALBERT ASSOON</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a principal of the applicant, 2324702 Ontario Inc, (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</BOLD>) and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except where I have been advised of same, in which case I have identified the source of the information and I believe such information to be true.
<P1>2. I make this affidavit in addition to the affidavit of Michael Assoon sworn on February 20, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Michael Assoon Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>). For ease of reference, I adopt the defined terms of the Michael Assoon Affidavit.</P1>
<P1>3. I have reviewed the affidavit of John Cook: sworn on May 6, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Cook Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>), the affidavit Romesh Rajasooriax sworn May 8, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rajasooriar Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>) and the affidavit of Pouneh Rouhani sworn on May 9, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rouhani Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>) and I also make this affidavit in response to those affidavits.</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Landlord's Allegations</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. It is my understanding that the Landlord is eager to remove the Tenant from the Premises, After the Lease was allegedly terminated in February, 2018, it appears as though the Landlord is looking for reasons and justifications to terminate the Lease.</P>
<P>5. For instance, after this application was commenced and before the Landlord served its responding materials, Rouhani sent a letter to all tenants and residents of 1305 Dundas Street West, the building, wherein the Premises is located (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Building&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>6. Rouhani's letter is headlined with the words <BOLD>&ldquo;LOSS OF QUIET ENJOYMENT&rdquo;</BOLD> [<BOLD>emphasis original</BOLD>] and, in the letter, she invites the tenants and residents of the Building to send her complaints that they may have about the Tenant. A copy of Rouhani's letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>7. Also, the allegations contained in the Landlord's responding application are almost all new, insofar as the Tenant did not hear about these allegations before the Lease was Terminated and this application was commenced. In particular:
<P1>(a) in regard, to the allegations in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Cook Affidavit, the Landlord has never alleged that the Tenant was in breach of the Lease due to noise issues prior to the commencement of this application;</P1>
<P1>(b) in regard to the allegations in paragraphs 8&ndash;15 of the Cook Affidavit, the Landlord has never alleged that the Tenant was in breach of the Lease due to vomit, urine and cigarette butts on the sidewalk in front of the Building or due to the Tenant's patrons spoking near the entrances to the Building. The Landlord has no knowledge whether or not its patrons had engaged in this behavior. There are also two other bars next to the Premises;</P1>
<P1>(c) in regard to the allegations in paragraph 20 of the Cook Affidavit, the Landlord has never alleged that the Tenant was in breach of the Lease due to garbage disposal at the rear of the Building prior to the commencement of this application; and</P1>
<P1>(d) in regard to the allegations in paragraphs 3&ndash;6 of the Rajasooriar Affidavit and paragraphs 7&ndash;9 of the Rouhani Affidavit, the Landlord has never mentioned that the Tenant was in breach of the Lease as a result of dealings with the Former landlord.</P1></P>
<P>8. Accordingly, the Landlord has made all of these allegations for the first time after the Lease was terminated by the Landlord on February 12, 2018, I also note that none of these allegations are mentioned on the Landlord's notice of termination dated February 12, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Termination Notice&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>9. In regard to the allegations contained in paragraph 5 of the Rouhani Affidavit, the City of Toronto Fire Services has never issued a fine to the Landlord regarding the Premises.</P>
<P>10. In January, 2018, I was in contact with the fire inspector regarding the issues in the notice of violation, as appended to the Rouhani Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Violation Notice&rdquo;</BOLD>). During this time, I corresponded with Rouhani and the fire inspector on a regular basis regarding the Violation Notice and the Tenant worked diligently to remedy ail of the issues raised.</P>
<P>11. It should also be noted that the fire inspector was performing an inspection of the entire Building, not just the Premises.</P>
<P>12. On January 23, 2018, I received an email from Rouhani attaching the Violation Notice, Rouhani stated in her email that the fire department would issue a fine if the issues were not rectified. I responded to the Rouhani's email on the same date regarding the Violation Notice, My email stated:
<QUOTE><P>We have been in correspondence with the inspector and 90% already corrected we are just waiting for Telsa to complete one request which is to update our fire suppression, they have not been able to schedule for over a month now.</P>
<P>On another note! We wish to meet if you're available this Thursday late morning perhaps early afternoon to discuss the extension of the lease. We will be meeting at a Realtor's office with the comparable.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>A copy of my email chain with Rouhani is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>13. The fire inspector scheduled another inspection, of the Premises on March 4, 2018 to ensure that the issues raised in the Violation Notice were all rectified. On March 3, 2018, I sent the fire inspector an email with attached pictures of the Premises to show him that the issues were all rectified. The fire inspector attended at the Premises on March 4, 2018 and confirmed that the issues raised in the Notice of Violation were all remedied and a fine was not issued. A copy of my email to the fine inspector is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>14. With respect to the other allegation in paragraph 5 of the Rouhani Affidavit, the landlord never alleged that the Tenant was in breach of the Lease for failing to pay Hydro Bills on time. In any event the Tenant was never issued a fine from Toronto Hydro and its Hydro bills are current.</P>
<P>15. In regard to the allegation in paragraph 6 of the Rouhani Affidavit, the Tenant did not fail to pay rent on time on two occasions. And, prior to serving the Termination Notice, the Landlord never alleged that the Tenant was in default of the Lease for failing to pay rent.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Rent Paid into Trust</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. As explained in paragraph 16 of the Michael Assoon Affidavit, on February 15, 2018, Waldman sent Binavince a letter attaching the rent cheque for February, 2018. On February 21, 2018, Binavince sent Waldman an email stating that the Landlord would not accept any rent cheques and would he returning the rent cheque for February, 2018. A copy of the email from Binavince to Waldman is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>17. Accordingly, since February, 2018, the Tenant has paid rent every month into its lawyer's trust account. On March 18, 2018, Binavince confirmed by email to Waldman that, provided the Tenant paid rent in trust while it is in possession of the Premises, the Landlord will not take any steps to terminate the Lease or re-enter the Premises. Binavince also confirmed by email on February 21, 2018 that that Landlord would not take any self-help remedies until this application is heard. Copies of the emails from Binavince to Waldman dated February 21, 2012 and March 18, 2018 are attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>18. On July 27, 2017, Rouhani sent me an email requesting post-dated cheques for the payment of rent from the period of August, 2017 to August, 2018. In her email, Rouhani confirmed that rent is payable in the amount of $7,274,00 per month. The Tenant has been paying rent in that amount into its lawyer's trust account since February, 2018. A copy of Rouhani's email to be is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&ldquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>19. To date, the Tenant has paid a total of $43,644,00 into its lawyer's trust account, representing rent payments from February, 2018 to July, 2018.

<P>I, <BOLD>POUNEH ROUHANI</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY <EM>(or</EM> AFFIRM<EM>)</EM>:</P>
<P>1. I am a director of the respondent 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Respondent</BOLD>&rdquo;). As such, I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed, save and except where I refer to matters based on information and belief, in which case I believe that information to be true</P>
<P>2. I make this affidavit to advise of developments with respect to this matter and capitalized terms in this affidavit have the same meaning as the capitalized terms in my affidavit sworn May 9, 2018, unless otherwise defined herein.</P>
<P>3. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Julian Binavince to Daniel Waldman, lawyer for the applicant, dated May 28, 2018, in which he requests production of bank records to demonstrate that the applicant had the funds required to pay rent as it became due.</P>
<P>4. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Binavince to Mr. Waldman dated July 2, 2018, in which Mr. Binavince provides particulars of rent due up to February 12, 2018 and thereafter, along with an email exchange between Mr. Binavince and Mr. Waldman dated July 12, 2018.</P>
<P>5. I am advised by Mr. Binavince that he and Mr. Waldman had originally agreed that cross-examinations would take place on July 4, 2018.</P>
<P>6. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Binavince to Mr. Waldman dated July 3, 2018 and the Certificate of Non-Attendance with respect to Michael Assoon dated July 4, 2018. I am advised by Mr. Binavince that the applicant has not paid any of the costs associated with the scheduled examination that the applicant's representative failed to attend.</P>
<P>7. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Binavince to Mr. Waldman dated July 27, 2018 with respect to the applicant's failure to produce financial records and attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Binavince to Mr. Waldman dated August 14, 2018 with respect to the rent arrears claimed by the landlord and the trust ledger of Mr. Waldman's firm with respect to payments allegedly made by the applicant to Mr. Waldman's firm.</P>
<P>8. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Binavince to Mr. Waldman dated August 15, 2018, which provides particulars with respect to the realty taxes for 2017 and 2018. I confirm that I obtained the &ldquo;property tax lookups&rdquo; that form part of Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P>
<P>9. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email from Mr. Waldman to Mr. Binavince dated August 15, 2018, along with Mr. Binavince's responding email dated August 16, 2018 and copies of the final property tax bills for 2017 and 2018 with respect to the Property that were attached to Mr. Binavince's email.</P>
<P>10. Since the respondent became the owner of the Property, the applicant has only been paying $7,274 on account of base rent and taxes. Based on my review of the lease documents, there was an increase in base rent effective October, 2017, but the applicant did not increase the payments on account of base rent. Furthermore, based on my calculations, since the respondent became landlord, rent arrears in the amount of $30,728.59 have accrued up to and including August 1, 2018. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> is a spreadsheet Mr. Binavince and I prepared showing the amount of rent outstanding as at August 1, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. This is an Application brought by 2324702 Ontario Inc., operating as Remix, (hereinafter <BOLD>&ldquo;Remix&rdquo;</BOLD>) for a declaration that its lease agreement with 1305 Dundas W. Inc. (hereinafter the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>), is in full force and effect. Alternatively, if this Honourable Court finds the lease agreement has been breached, Remix seeks an Order for relief from forfeiture.</P1>
<P1>2. Remix's Application ought to be granted for several reasons, including that:
<P2>a. It has not previously breached the lease agreement with the Landlord;</P2>
<P2>b. The reason for the late payment in dispute was caused by matters out of its control;</P2>
<P2>c. Remix acted quickly and transparently in curing its late payment; and,</P2>
<P2>d. Remix has made significant investments into its business and it would be unjust to terminate the lease on the basis of its late payment (which has since been rectified).</P2></P1>
<P1>3. Only through the relief sought on its motion can Remix address the injustice and hardships arising from the attempted termination of the lease.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Remix&mdash;Background</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>4. Remix is a restaurant and lounge operating in the basement of a commercial building municipally known as 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Property&rdquo;</BOLD>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Assoon sworn February 20, 2018 Application Record of Remix [<BOLD>&ldquo;AR&rdquo;</BOLD>], Tab 2, [<BOLD>&ldquo;Michael Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>].

<P1>5. Remix has been in business since 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The business is owned and operated by three brothers: Albert Assoon, Michael Assoon and David Assoon.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pouneh Transcript, questions 48, 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>6. Throughout its lease, Remix has paid its rent and regularly provided its Landlord with postdated cheques for rent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>7. Prior to the events giving rise to this Application, Remix has never had its lease terminated nor has been notified of any default under its lease.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pouneh transcript, questions 61 - 63, 82, 83, 84, 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Lease Agreement</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>8. On March 1, 2008, Remix<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>At the time, Remix was known as 1617514 Ontario Limited.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> entered into a lease agreement with 1358024 Ontario Limited (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Lease Agreement&rdquo;</BOLD>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 2; Lease Agreement dated March 1, 2018, AR, Tab 2-A. Note: 1358024 Ontario Limited was the former Landlord. The building was sold in 2017.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>9. Under to the Lease Agreement, Remix leased the basement unit in the Property until February 28, 2013.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>10. The Lease Agreement conferred an Option to Extend for two (2) further periods of five (5) years, on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>at s.2.02.1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As such, Remix has the option to lease its premise until 2023.</P1>
<P1>11. On September 5, 2013 the parties entered into a Lease Amending Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Amending Agreement&rdquo;</BOLD>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 3; Lease Amending Agreement dated September 5, 2015, AR, Tab 2-B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>12. Pursuant to the Amending Agreement, the parties agreed to extend the lease for a further five (5) years commencing October 1, 2013 and expiring September 31, 2018.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> See: Section 1 of the Lease Amending Agreement.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Moreover, and consistent with the terms of the original Lease Agreement, Remix was given the option to extend its lease for a further five (5) years subject to certain conditions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> See: at section 4 of the Lease Amending Agreement.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>13. Remix has, at all time, validly exercised its right to renew the Lease Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Amending Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Albert Assoon, sworn August 30, 2018, [<BOLD>&ldquo;Albert's Third Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>], Supplementary Reply Record of Remix [<BOLD>&ldquo;SRR&rdquo;</BOLD>], at paras. 3&ndash;7; Email to Laleh Rouhani dated May 15, 2017, SRR, Tab 1-A; Email from Pouneh Rouhani dated June 6, 2017, SRR, Tab 1-B; Email thread with Michael Assoon and Rouhani dated October 16, 2017 to November 17, 2017, SRR, Tab 1-C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>14. However, the Landlord has indicated it no longer wants Remix as its tenant for the additional term otherwise provided for under the Amending Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 6. See also: Pouneh Transcript, questions 64, 76, 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Simply put, the Landlord no longer wants Remix as its tenant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pouneh Transcript, questions 76, 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Late Payment</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>15. On or around February 1, 2018, Remix's bank account was frozen by the Canada Revenue Agency (the <BOLD>&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;</BOLD>). Remix had no prior notice that this drastic action would be taken.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>16. As a result of this incident, Remix was deprived of the opportunity to pay the Landlord rent on the first of the month, as required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>17. In the meantime, Remix took immediate steps to rectify the matter in order to regain access to its bank account.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>18. On February 12, 2018, the Landlord purported to terminate the lease by changing the locks to the premise and posting a termination notice on the front door.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 9; Notice of Termination, AR, Tab 2-C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Landlord did not notify Remix, a tenant at the Property for ten (10) years, before taking this step.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>19. According to the Notice of Termination posted:
<QUOTE><P>The Tenant has defaulted under Articles 2.03 and 3.01 of the Lease, as amended, by failing to pay rent due and payable on February 1, 2018. The Tenant has failed to cure the default.</P></QUOTE></P1></P>
<P>And:
<QUOTE><P>The Landlord has re-entered the Premises and the Landlord will take whatever actions it considers appropriate, including but not limited to commencing legal proceedings against the Tenant for any damages suffered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 9; Notice of Termination, AR, Tab 2-C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P1>20. Contrary to the Notice of Termination, the Landlord did not re-enter the premise.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 11&ndash;13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In fact, the Landlord only changed the locks on the <EM>front doors</EM>. The locks on the back doors were left unchanged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As such, Remix was able to continue accessing the premise.</P1>
<P1>21. Moreover, at the time the front door locks were changed, Michael Assoon, one of the Principals of Remix, was working inside. The Landlord was unaware that Mr. Assoon was inside due to the fact that the Landlord, or its representative, had not bothered to check whether the premise was, in fact, empty.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 11, 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Remix Cures its Late Payment and Puts the Rent in Good Standing</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>22. Immediately after becoming aware of the Notice of Termination, Albert Assoon, another Principle of Remix, contacted the Landlord's Principal, Pouneh Rouhani, to explain the situation and resolve the issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 14; Email to Ms. Pouneh Rouhani dated February 13, 2018; AR, Tab 2-D.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>23. In his email to Ms. Rouhani, Mr. A. Assoon explained that the CRA's action came as a complete surprise to him but that he eventually resolved the issues with the CRA. He also apologized for not having contacted the Landlord sooner to explain the situation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 14; Email to Ms. Pouneh Rouhani dated February 13, 2018, AR, Tab 2-D.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>24. On February 13, 2018, the Landlord's lawyer, Mr. Julian Binavince, contacted Mr. A. Assoon with a settlement offer. The parties did not reach a settlement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>25. On February 15, 2015, Remix's former lawyer, Mr. Daniel Waldman, sent a letter to Mr. Binavince enclosing a cheque (dated February 14, 2018) for February 1<SUP>st</SUP> rent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 16; Email from Daniel Waldman dated February 15, 2018, AR, Tab 2-F.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At this point, the rent for February was no longer outstanding.</P1>
<P1>26. The Landlord did not indicate that it would refuse the cheque at the time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>27. To date, Remix has made all its rent payments and desires to continue making rent payments in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at paras. 18, 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>28. Remix has also made substantial investments in the business over the past three years. It currently employs approximately 24 employees and hires live entertainment on a weekly basis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Albert Assoon, sworn February 2018 [<BOLD>&ldquo;Albert's First Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>], at para. 12, AR, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>29. Given the number of years remix has operated from its location, together with its investment in the business, Remix would suffer serious financial hardships and reputational damage if its lease is terminated.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE ISSUES</TI>
<P><P1>30. The issues to be determined on this application are:
<P2>a. Whether the lease Agreement remains in force and effect; and,</P2>
<P2>b. In the alternative, whether this Honourable Court should exercise its discretion to grant Remix relief from forfeiture.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;THE LAW&amp; AGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Lease was not Validly Terminated</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>31. To terminate a commercial lease by re-taking possession, the Landlord's conduct must result in the Tenant being excluded from the premises. Equivocal behaviour in this regard will not suffice.</P1>
<P1>32. In a recent decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Court reviewed the jurisprudence on this issue and summarize the following principles:
<P2>a. A landlord may effect re-entry by changing the locks on the tenant's premises.</P2>
<P2>b. <BOLD>However, the mere act of changing the locks is not determinative of whether the lease has been forfeited.</BOLD></P2>
<P2>c. <BOLD>To effect a forfeiture, the landlord must deprive the tenant of possession.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lakehead Roofing &amp; Metal Cladding Ltd. v. 1304808 Ontario Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2018] O.J. No. 808</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Remix' Book of Authorities [<BOLD>&ldquo;BOA&rdquo;</BOLD>], Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P2></P1>
<P1>33. In an earlier decision, <CASEREF><SOC>Rays Outfitters Inc. v. Lixo Investments Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 3042</CITE></CASEREF>, G. Mew J, held that:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>It does not automatically follow from the fact that the landlord has changed the locks to rented premises that the landlord has forfeited the lease.</BOLD> More significant than the changing of the locks is whether the intended or actual effect is to exclude the tenant from the premises. If so, then the lease is terminated and any subsequent distress is unlawful: <CASEREF><SOC>Falwyn Investors Group Ltd. v. G.P.M. Real Property (6) Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1998] O.J. No. 5258</CITE><COURTJUR>Gen. Div.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Project 360 Investments v. 1301584 Ontario Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>71 R.P.R. (4th) 210</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. Sup. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Rays Outfitters Inc. v. Lixo Investments Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 3042</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>34. In this case, the Landlord did not effect re-entry with the unequivocal intention of excluding Remix. First, the Landlord only changed the front locks, despite knowing that there was a back entrance as well. Second, the Landlord never entered the premises to inspect whether anyone was inside during its purported re-possession. As such, Remix continued to occupy and use the premise during the purported termination.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Albert's Third Affidavit, at para. 12; Phone Record for landline at the Premises dated February 11, 2018-February 13, 2018, SRR, Tab 1-F.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Third, both parties' counsel exchanged a number of emails regarding the late rent payment and reached an interim agreement, which remains in force to this day. Finally, the Landlord only brought its Cross-Application (which, itself, seeks a declaration that the Lease Agreement has been terminated) in July 2018&mdash;<UNDER>five months after Remix was late in paving its rent for February.</UNDER> All of these factors demonstrate that the Landlord's concern was to receive its February rent rather than indefinitely exclude its tenant.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Relief from Forfeiture Should be Granted in the Circumstances</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>35. Relief from forfeiture has its origins in equity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Harvey M. Haber, <EM>Tenant's Rights and remedies in a Commercial Lease: a Practical Guide</EM>, 2d, (Toronto: Canada Law Books Inc., 2015), BOA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the authoritative text, <EM>Tenant's Rights and Remedies in a Commercial Lease: A Practical Guide</EM>, author Harvey M. Haber explains equity's role in this regard:
<QUOTE><P>Over time, the courts began to recognize that blind adherence to rules could result in injustice to a tenant, and principles of equity developed to ameliorate that situation. Equity ...looked to the substance of an agreement and tried to give effect to the parties' true intentions. For example, since the re-entry remedy was intended as security for a landlord to enforce the tenant's material lease obligations...it was considered an affront to conscience to allow a party to pervert it to a different and oppressive purpose (for example, where the landlord's true intention is not to have the default cured but rather to obtain possession of the premises to re-let at a higher rent). <BOLD>To the extent that the tenant's lease obligations could be satisfied without termination, equity would intervene to grant relief from forfeiture so the landlord-tenant relationship could continue.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at p. 317, BOA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>36. This Honourable Court has three sources of jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture in these circumstances.</P1>
<P1>37. First, section 98 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> provides a general power to grant relief against penalties and forfeitures:
<QUOTE><P>A court may grant relief against penalties and forfeitures, on such terms as to compensation or otherwise as are considered just.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>38. Second, the <EM>Commercial Tenancies Act</EM> specifically confers such authority to the courts:
<QUOTE><P>Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce a right of re-entry or forfeiture, whether for non-payment of rent or for other cause, the lessee may, in the lessor's action, if any, or if there is no such action pending, then in an action or application in the Superior Court of Justice brought by the lessee, apply to the court for relief, and <BOLD>the court may grant such relief as, having regard to the proceeding and conduct of the parties under section 19 and to all the other circumstances, the court thinks fit, and on such terms as to payment of rent, costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty, or otherwise, including the granting of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future as the court considers just.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Commercial Tenancies Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, s. 20(1).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P2>[Emphasis added.]</P2></P1>
<P1>39. Finally, the Superior Court of Justice has inherent jurisdiction to grant relief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 11(1).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Factors to Consider in Granting Relief from Forfeiture</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>40. The Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 S.C.R. 490</CITE></CASEREF>, considered the following factors in deciding whether to grant relief from forfeiture:
<P2>a. Whether the conduct of the Tenant was reasonable in the circumstances;</P2>
<P2>b. Whether the object of the right of forfeiture was to essentially secure the payment of money; and,</P2>
<P2>c. Whether there is a substantial disparity between the value of the property forfeited and the damage caused by the breach.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[ 1994] 2 S.C.R. 490</CITE><PARANUM>32 33</PARANUM></CASEREF>, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Shiloh Spinners Ltd. v. Harding</SOC><CITE>[1973] A.C. 691</CITE><COURTJUR>H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2></P1>
<P1>41. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ontario (Attorney General) v. 8477 Darlington Crescent</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 363</CITE></CASEREF>, Doherty J.A. stated that:
<QUOTE><P>The power to relieve from forfeiture is discretionary and fact-specific. The power is predicated on the existence of circumstances in which enforcing a contractual right of forfeiture, although consistent with the terms of the contract, visits an inequitable consequence on the party that breached the contract. <BOLD>Relief from forfeiture is particularly appropriate where the interests of the party seeking enforcement by forfeiture can be fully vindicated without resort to forfeiture.</BOLD> Relief from forfeiture is granted sparingly and the party seeking the relief bears the onus of making the case for it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ontario (Attorney General) v. 8477 Darlington Crescent</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 363</CITE><PARANUM>86&ndash;77</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>42. With respect to the three factors articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the <EM>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd.</EM> decision, Doherty J.A. explained:
<QUOTE><P>The first factor, the conduct of the breaching party, requires an examination of the reasonableness of the breaching party's conduct as it relates to all facets of the contractual relationship, <BOLD>including the breach in issue and the aftermath of the breach.</BOLD></P>
<P>The second factor ..., the gravity of the breach, looks both at the nature of the breach itself and the impact of that breach on the contractual rights of the other party. If, for example, the forfeiture provision operated as a means of securing payment of the rent required under a lease, <BOLD>the fact that the breaching party had paid all amounts owing could obviate the need to resort to forfeiture and support a claim for relief from forfeiture.</BOLD></P>
<P>The third factor ... engages a kind of proportionality analysis. If there is a large difference between the <BOLD>value of the property to be forfeited and the amount owing as a result of the breach, equity will favour relief from forfeiture.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>43. Subsequent decisions have further elaborated on this criteria. For instance,
<P2>a. In assessing a Tenant's conduct, courts have looked to whether the breach was wilful and intentional;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1497777 Ontario Inc. v. Leon's Furniture Limited et al.</SOC><CITE>[2003] O.J. No. 3708</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 72, BOA, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>b. With respect to the gravity of the breach, courts have tended to exercise its discretion to grant relief against forfeiture provided the landlord does not suffer serious financial loss or prejudice;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>York Condominium Corp. No. 26 v. Becker Milk Co. Ltd. et al</SOC><YEAR>1982</YEAR><CITE>37 O.R. (2d) 679</CITE></CASEREF>, BOA, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>c. In considering the disparity between the value of the property forfeited and the damage caused by the breach, courts will consider whether the tenant's potential loss from forfeiture would be disproportionately large compared to the landlord's loss; and,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Nesbitt v. RJH Reinsurance Services Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2014] O.J. No. 1985</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. S.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 10, BOA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>d. Historically, courts have granted relief from forfeiture in circumstances of fraud, accident, mistake or surprise.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1497777 Ontario Inc. v. Leon's Furniture Limited et al.</SOC><CITE>[2003] O.J. No. 3708</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 69, BOA, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2></P1>
<P1>44. Each of these factors weigh in favour of granting Remix relief from forfeiture.</P1>
<P1>45. First, the reason for the delayed rent payment was due to matters outside Remix's control and which came as a surprise to the tenant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at paras. 8; Albert First Affidavit at para. 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The matter was a mistake, which it subsequently dealt with.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, Remix notified the Landlord about the issue and apologized that it occurred.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 14; Email to Pouneh Rouhani dated February 13, 2018, AR, Tab 2-D.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A cheque was also issued for the full amount of the rent on February 14, 2018&mdash;two days after the Notice of Termination.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 16; Letter from Daniel Waldman dated February 15, 2018, AR, Tab 2-F;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As such, Remix handled this matter honestly and transparently. Remix never intended not to pay the rent.</P1>
<P1>46. Remix has also since complied with Justice Nakatsuru's Endorsement directing it to pay its monthly rent in accordance with the Lease Agreement.</P1>
<P1>47. The Landlord has raised issues concerning to previous instances of late rent payment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The Affidavit of Romesh Rajasooriar, sworn May 8, 2018, Responding Application Record, Tab 2, at paras. 3&ndash;5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such issues did not affect the current Landlord. Moreover, the previous Landlord never brought an Application to terminate its lease with Remix on account for late payment of rent. To the extent that Remix was late in paying its rent to the previous Landlord&mdash;which is not admitted and for which there is no direct evidence&mdash;there is no evidence that the previous Landlord refused to accept late payments or treated this as a breach of the Lease Agreement.</P1>
<P1>48. Second, the breach in question is not serious and the amount has since been paid in full.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Michael Affidavit, at para. 16; Letter from Daniel Waldman dated February 15, 2018 enclosing rent cheque, AR, Tab 2-F.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition to paying the rent for February, Remix has also paid such further amounts as directed by Justice Nakatsuru's Endorsement.</P1>
<P1>49. It is also clear that the purpose of the termination was solely to secure the February 2018 rent.</P1>
<P1>50. This was corroborated by Ms. Pouneh Rouhani, the Landlord's Managing Director, on cross-examination:
<QUOTE><P>39 Q. Okay. And this lease was terminated on February 12, 2018; am I correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes, Correct.</P>
<P>40 Q. Okay. And the reason for this termination was a failure to pay rent. Am I correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes. Correct.</P>
<P>41 Q. Okay. So did the landlord send a default notice before serving a termination notice?</P>
<P>A. No.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>51. With respect to the February 12, 2018 Notice of Termination, Ms. Rouhani unequivocally confirmed that the only grounds upon which the Landlord desired to terminate its lease with Remix was the late payment of the February 2018 rent.</P1>
<P1>52. With respect to the third factor, the Landlord has not suffered a true loss in the circumstances. Remix paid its February rent in February and the Landlord has received rent for every month thereafter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Albert Assoon sworn July 16, 2018 [<BOLD>&ldquo;Albert's Second Affidavit&rdquo;</BOLD>], Reply Record of Remix [<BOLD>&ldquo;RR&rdquo;</BOLD>], Tab 1, at paras. 16&ndash;19; Emails between Daniel Waldman and Julian Binavince dated March 18, 2018, RR, Tab 1-E; Emails from Rouhani dated July 27, 2018, RR, Tab 1-F; Trust Statements as of July 12, 2018, RR, Tab 1-G; Copies of Rent Cheques reflected on Trust Statements, Tab 1-H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>53. To the extent the Landlord has disputed the <EM>quantum</EM> of rent owing, it does so pursuant to a Cross-Application (CV-18-00601413-00) which requires this Honourable Court to interpret and determine certain contractual rights and obligations. At the time of the incident giving rise to this Application, the Landlord never took the position that the rent paid was insufficient.</P1>
<P1>54. The Landlord is not financially prejudiced by a single late payment&mdash;especially where the arrears was fully paid two weeks after it was due, and two days after the Notice of Termination.</P1>
<P1>55. It appears that the Landlord is using this single instance of late payment to achieve its ulterior objective of removing Remix as a tenant. It desperately wants Remix to vacate the premises. This was confirmed by Ms. Rouhani on cross-examination:
<QUOTE><P>76 Q. Okay. And so you want them out because it would be easier to lease the ground floor without them?</P>
<P>A. The ground floor, yes.</P>
<P>77 Q. Okay. So you prefer them not to operate in there?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>56. If the Landlord no longer desires to have Remix as a tenant (for business reasons or otherwise), it ought to reach a settlement to achieve this objective.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pouneh Transcript, question 64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>57. This Honourable Court should not countenance the Landlord's strategy of protracted litigation and strategic use of minor, technical issues as the basis for terminating its lease with Remix. To allow this, would be to ignore the commercial realities of business which would be an affront to conscience and common sense. The practical consequence of this is that Remix will suffer financial hardship and business disruption. It will also set a precedent for other commercial Landlords who contemplate using similar strategies, when it suits their interests. Justice requires a better outcome.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P><P1>58. Remix respectfully requests that this Honourable Court Orders:
<P2>a. That the Lease Agreement between Remix and the Landlord remains in force and effect; and,</P2>
<P2>b. In the event this Honourable Court finds that Remix breached the Lease Agreement, an Order granting relief from forfeiture.</P2></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this week of December 10, 2018</BOLD></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This application relates to a commercial lease between 1617514 Ontario Limited (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</BOLD>), as tenant, and 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>), as landlord, with respect to premises in the basement of the building having the municipal address 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Lease&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>2. The Landlord became the owner of the property having the municipal address 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Property&rdquo;</BOLD>) in or about July 2017.</P>
<P>3. The premises that are the subject of the Lease (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Premises&rdquo;</BOLD>) are used by the Tenant as a nightclub and event space. The building on the Property (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Building&rdquo;</BOLD>) consists of the Premises, a ground floor commercial space that has been vacant for some time, and many residential units on the second and third floor of the Building.</P>
<P>4. On or about February 1, 2018, the Tenant defaulted on its obligation to pay rent. Pursuant to its rights under the Lease, on or about February 12, 2018, the Landlord changed the locks to the main entrance of the Premises and delivered a notice to terminate.</P>
<P>5. The Tenant now seeks relief from forfeiture and the Landlord brings an application for, among other things, a declaration that the Lease is terminated and that the Tenant has failed to exercise its right of renewal under the Lease.</P>
<P>6. The Landlord and Tenant agreed to an interim settlement in order that the matter could be heard in the normal course. The Landlord's position is that the Tenant has failed to honour the terms of the interim settlement.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;RELEVANT FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Building and the Lease</TI>
<P><P1>7. On March 1, 2008, 1358023 Ontario Limited, as landlord (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Former Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>), and 1617514 Ontario Limited, as tenant, entered into the Lease.
<P2><BOLD>Lease, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Michael Assoon, sworn February 20, 2018 [&ldquo;Michael Affidavit&rdquo;], Application Record, page 14</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>8. The relevant portions of the Lease with respect to this dispute are as follows:
<P2>a. Section 2.03: &ldquo;The Tenant will pay to the Landlord, its successors or assigns, in lawful money of Canada and without any compensation, deduction or set-off whatsoever:

<P2>b. Section 2.05(5): <BOLD>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this lease</BOLD>, the Tenant is responsible for Minimum Rent, plus GST, it's metered utilities, and <BOLD>one-third (33.33%) of the realty taxes for the property at 1305 Dundas Street West</BOLD>. No other Additional Rent is payable.&rdquo; <BOLD>(emphasis added)</BOLD></P2>
<P2>c. Section 2.07: &ldquo;If any sums of money required under this lease to be paid by the Tenant either to the Landlord or otherwise are not paid at the time provided in this lease, they will be collectible as rent with the next instalment of rent falling due, but nothing in this lease suspends or delays the payment of such sums when they become due and payable, or limits any other remedy of the Landlord.&rdquo;</P2>
<P2>d. Section 5.03: &ldquo;The tax payments required to be made by the Tenant to the Landlord under the provisions of this Section shall be estimated by the Landlord, and the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord in addition to the monthly payments of Minimum Rent hereinbefore reserved, 1/3rd of the estimated annual tax payments in each calendar year with an adjustment being made as hereinafter set forth. If not so available, then such amount shall be estimated by the Landlord and <BOLD>when the property tax bill respecting the entire lands and Building of which the Premises form part is received by the Landlord for each year, the Tenant shall forthwith pay to the Landlord such additional sums as may be required in order that out of such monthly additional payments, the Landlord may pay the whole amount of the annual taxes as the instalment thereof fall due;&rdquo; (emphasis added)</BOLD></P2>
<P2>e. Section 6.07: &ldquo;Tenant shall not use or permit to be used any part of the Premises for any dangerous, noxious or offensive activity or goods and shall not do or bring anything or permit anything to be done or brought on or about the Premises or the Project which results in undue noise or vibration or which Landlord in its sole discretion may deem to be hazardous or a nuisance or annoyance to any other tenants or any other persons permitted to be on the Project, including without limitation any objectionable odours emanating from the Premises......
<P3>Tenant shall conduct its business on the Premises in keeping with a first-class building. To that end, Tenant covenants and agrees that it shall not cause, suffer or permit any fumes, odours, noise, vibrations or other element, any of which is determined by Landlord in its sole discretion to be a nuisance and/or disturbance to Landlord or any other occupant of the Building, to emanate from the Premises.&rdquo;</P3></P2>
<P2>f. Section 7.08: &ldquo;The Tenant will not commit or permit any waste or injury to the Premises including the Leasehold improvements and trade fixtures therein, any overloading of the floors thereof, any nuisance therein or any use or manner of use causing annoyance to the other tenants and occupants of the Building.&rdquo;</P2>
<P2>g. Section 7.10: &ldquo;The Tenant will comply at its own expense with all municipal, federal, provincial, sanitary, fire and safety laws, regulations and requirements pertaining to the operation and use of the Premises, the condition of the Leasehold Improvements, trade fixtures, furniture and equipment installed by the Tenant therein and the making by the Tenant of any repairs, changes or improvements therein.&rdquo;</P2>
<P2>h. Paragraph 7 of Schedule C: &ldquo;The tenant shall not abuse, misuse or damage the premises or the Common Area and Facilities, and in particular, shall not deposit rubbish in any plumbing apparatus and shall not deface or mark any walls or other parts of the Premises or the Common Areas and Facilities.&rdquo;</P2>
<P2>i. Paragraph 10 of Schedule C: &ldquo;The entrances, lobbies, elevators, staircases, pedestrian malls and other public portions of the Common Areas and Facilities are for use only for access, and the Tenant shall not obstruct or misuse such facilities or permit them to be obstructed or misused by its agents, employees, invitees or others under its control.&rdquo;</P2>
<P2>j. Paragraph 15 of Schedule C: &ldquo;The Tenant shall not cause or permit objectionable odor, vibration or noise from mechanical apparatus or other source, to emanate from or be dispelled beyond the limits of the Premises.&rdquo;</P2></P1>
<P1>9. The Tenant became the tenant of the Premises by a lease amending agreement dated September 5, 2013 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Amending Agreement&rdquo;</BOLD>). The Amending Agreement also extended the term of the Lease, provided the Tenant with the option to extend the term by a further five years and called for rent increases over the extension period.
<P2><BOLD>Extension Agreement, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to Michael Affidavit [the &ldquo;Extension Agreement&rdquo;], Application Record, page 45</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>10. Pursuant to the Amending Agreement, base rent increased from $5,037.50 to $5,166.67, not including HST, effective October 1, 2017 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;2017 Rent Increase&rdquo;</BOLD>).
<P2><BOLD>Ibid, page 46</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>11. The Amending Agreement states: &ldquo;Provided that the Tenant is: (a) 2324702 Ontario Inc.; (b) in occupation of the whole of the Premises; and (c) not in default under this Lease, the Tenant shall have the option exercisable on no less than nine (9) months' and no more than eleven (11) months' written notice to the Landlord prior to the expiry of the then current Term to extend the Lease with respect to the Premises for one (1) additional term of five (5) years [...].&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Ibid</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>12. The Landlord became the owner of the Property in or about July 2017 and became the landlord of the Premises by an assignment agreement dated July 21, 2017.
<P2>Affidavit of Pouneh Rouhani, sworn May 9, 2018 [&ldquo;Rouhani First Affidavit&rdquo;], Responding Application Record, at paragraph 3; Michael Affidavit, at paragraph 4</P2></P1>
<P1>13. The Lease expired on September 31, 2018.
<P2><BOLD>Extension Agreement, page 45</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Termination of the Lease</TI>
<P><P1>14. It is not disputed that the Tenant's rent cheque for February, 2018 was dishonoured and that the Tenant was unable to pay and did not pay the February 2018 rent when it was due.</P1>
<P1>15. Early on the morning of February 12, 2018, the Landlord changed the locks to the main entrance of the Premises and posted a notice of termination on the door of the Premises.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Affidavit, at paragraph 9; Answers to Undertakings of Michael Assoon</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>16. The Tenant's representative acknowledges that the Landlord tried to terminate the Lease by changing the locks to the Premises and providing a notice of termination.

<BLOCK2><TI>Failure to Pay Increase in Rent and Property Taxes When Demanded</TI>
<P><P1>17. When the Landlord became landlord of the Building and the owner of the Property, the Tenant was paying the monthly amount of $7,274 as rent, calculated as follows: $5,027.50 on account of base rent, $654.88 on account of HST on base rent, and $1,581.63 on account of realty taxes.
<P2><BOLD>Affidavit of Pouneli Rouhani, sworn August 17, 2018 [&ldquo;Rouhani Second Affidavit&rdquo;], Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, at paragraph 10; Chart, Exhibit H to Rouhani Second Affidavit, Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, page 40</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>18. The Tenant acknowledges the 2017 Rent Increase.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Transcript, questions 54-55; Transcript of the Cross-Examination of Albert Assoon, dated October 18, 2018 [&ldquo;Albert Transcript&rdquo;], questions 39-45</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>19. The Tenant acknowledges that, since the Landlord has become landlord of the Premises, the Tenant has never increased its rental payments, notwithstanding the 2017 Rent Increase.
<P2><BOLD>Albert Transcript, questions 37 and 39-45</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>20. The Tenant acknowledges it is required to pay one third (33.33 percent) of realty taxes for the Building.
<P2><BOLD>Albert Transcript, question 61</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>21. The 2018 municipal property taxes with respect to the Property were in the amount of $122,842.12.
<P2><BOLD>Tax Bill, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; to Rouhani Second Affidavit, Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, page 38</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>22. The Tenant acknowledges it received a copy of the 2018 property tax bill and the Tenant acknowledges the Landlord has paid all 2018 property taxes.
<P2><BOLD>Albert Transcript, questions 46-49</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>23. Since the Landlord has collected rent as owner of the Property, the Tenant has refused, neglected or otherwise failed to pay more than $7,274 monthly. In this regard, on July 2, 2018, August 14, 2018 and August 15, 2018, the Landlord, through counsel, demanded payment of rental arrears.
<P2><BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to Rouhani Second Affidavit, Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, page 7; Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; to Rouhani Second Affidavit, Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, page 24; Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; to Rouhani Second Affidavit, Supplementary Responding Application Record of the Respondent, page 26</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>24. At cross-examinations of the Tenant's representatives on August 17, 2018 and October 18, 2018, the Tenant acknowledged the Landlord's claims for rent. The Tenant baldly alleges this amount is in dispute, but has failed to provide particulars of the dispute.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Transcript, question 204; Albert Transcript, question 15</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>25. At the return of the within application on September 11, 2018, the Tenant (through counsel) acknowledged the amount of $9,204.17 was owing on account of realty taxes owing for 2017, and the Tenant was ordered to pay such amount to the Landlord, forthwith.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Tenant's History of Failing to Pay Rent</TI>
<P><P1>26. The former owner of the Property frequently had problems with the Tenant in regards to late or non-payment of rent.
<P2><BOLD>Rouhani First Affidavit, at paragraph 8</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>27. Prior to the Landlord becoming owner of the Property, post-dated cheques given by the Tenant were returned by the Former Landlord's bank as NSF, and replacement cheques were often not provided for over one to two months after the post-dated cheques were returned.
<P2><BOLD>Affidavit of Romesh Rajasooriar, sworn May 9, 2018 [Rajasooriar Affidavit], Responding Application Record, at paragraph 5</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>28. In the period immediately prior to the Landlord becoming owner of the Property, the Tenant's rent arrears were in excess of $20,000.
<P2><BOLD>Rajasooriar Affidavit, at paragraph 7</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>29. The Tenant baldly alleges it has historically paid the rent on time, but it refuses to provide bank records to support its claim.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Affidavit, at paragraph 7; Answers to Undertakings of Michael Assoon</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Renewal of Lease</TI>
<P><P1>30. On cross-examination, the Tenant's representative was asked to provide evidence of its written notice of renewal. The Tenant provided a series of emails as evidence.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Transcript, questions 76-78; Answers to Undertakings of Michael Assoon, schedule B</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Interim Agreement</TI>
<P><P1>31. There is an interim agreement between the parties permitting the Tenant to have possession of the Premises pending the resolution of the within dispute (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Interim Agreement&rdquo;</BOLD>).
<P2><BOLD>Rouhani First Affidavit, at paragraph 11</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>32. The Tenant's representative acknowledges that the Landlord did not accept the replacement cheque with respect to the rent for February 2018.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Transcript, questions 188-189</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>33. The Tenant's representative acknowledges the Landlord's position that the Lease has been terminated and that the Tenant is only permitted to its current possession of the Premises through the Interim Agreement.
<P2><BOLD>Michael Transcript, questions 190-193</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Residential Tenants&rdquo; Complaints</TI>
<P><P1>34. In addition to the Premises, the Landlord rents out 24 apartments on the second and third floors of the Building (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Apartments&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>35. Residents of the Apartments (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Residents</BOLD>&rdquo;) are regularly woken up between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. by noise created by customers of the Tenant's nightclub (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Nightclub</BOLD>&rdquo;) milling around in front of the Building. The disturbances have become more frequent beginning in March 2018, since the Nightclub commenced operating every night as opposed to only on weekends.
<P2><BOLD>Affidavit of John Cook, sworn May 6, 2018 [&ldquo;Cook Affidavit&rdquo;], Responding Application Record, at paragraphs 4-5</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>36. Residents have also complained about vibrations caused by the Nightclub.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 6-7</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>37. The sidewalk in front of the Building and the area around the entry of the Nightclub is littered with cigarette butts. The &ldquo;no smoking signs&rdquo; posted around the front of the Building are frequently removed or vandalized.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 8 and 10</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>38. Frequently, patrons of the Nightclub vomit and urinate directly in front of or on the door of the Building that leads up to the Apartments, as well as elsewhere in front of the Building
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 8-9</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>39. Although the cigarette butts, vomit and the smell of urine are obvious, nobody from the Nightclub cleans the area in front of the Building. Instead, the Landlord's personnel have been left to clean up the mess.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 11-12</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>40. Congregations of smokers at the front of the Building during the Nightclub's hours of operation make access to the Apartments difficult and distasteful. Several female Residents have complained that some smokers intimidate them to such an extent that they are afraid when entering the Building.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraph 13 and 14</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>41. The Tenant's business has negatively impacted the Landlord's ability to rent space in the Building.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 7 and 15; Transcript of the Cross-Examination of Pouneh Rouhani, dated August 30, 2018 [&ldquo;Rouhani Transcript&rdquo;), questions 64-76; Rouhani First Affidavit, at paragraphs 3-4</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Garbage</TI>
<P><P1>42. The Landlord has retained Waste Management, a private contractor, to dispose of the garbage generated by the Residents (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Residential Garbage&rdquo;</BOLD>) because the configuration of the Building makes the use of the bins supplied by the municipality difficult.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraph 16</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>43. The Landlord's representative has noticed that garbage has been added to the Residential Garbage before Waste Management collects it early Thursday mornings. These added bags have no &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that one purchases from the City of Toronto for overflow garbage collection.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraphs 17-18</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>44. The Landlord's representative believes that the Nightclub operators are occasionally disposing of their garbage at the Landlord's cost.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraph 19</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>45. The Nightclub operators also throw garbage and other articles at the rear of the Building, blocking fire exits and escape routes. Earlier this year, there was an inspection by the fire department (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Fire Inspection&rdquo;</BOLD>). Although the Fire Inspection prompted the Nightclub operators to clean the rear of the Building at the time, they continue to put garbage and other articles there.
<P2><BOLD>Cook Affidavit, at paragraph 20</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P>46. The issues to be determined in this application are:
<P1>(a) Whether the Lease was validly terminated on or about February 12, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) If the Lease was validly terminated, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant the Tenant relief from forfeiture;</P1>
<P1>(c) Whether the Lease was properly renewed; and</P1>
<P1>(d) What, if any, amount is owed to the Landlord on account of rent?</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Lease was validly terminated</TI>
<P><P1>47. A landlord may re-enter leased premises after non-payment of rent &ldquo;although no formal demand thereof has been made.&rdquo; As such, notice of default is not required to be provided unless the parties to a lease agree otherwise.
<P2><BOLD>Commercial Tenancies Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, section 18(1)</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>48. Section 17.01(a) of the Lease permits the Landlord to terminate the Lease if the Tenant &ldquo;fail[s], for any reason, to make any payment of Rent as and when the same is due to be paid hereunder and such default shall continue for five (5) business days after such payment was due, whether or not notice is given to the Tenant.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>49. Section 17.01(j)(i) of the Lease requires the Landlord to provide written notice of termination.</P1>
<P1>50. The Tenant acknowledged the locks to the main entrance of the Premises were changed and that the Landlord delivered a notice of termination. The Tenant also understood that, through these acts, the Landlord was trying to terminate the Lease.</P1>
<P1>51. The Landlord complied with its contractual and statutory obligations with respect to the termination of the Lease and the Tenant understood the Landlord's intention was to terminate the Lease. Accordingly, the Landlord is entitled to a declaration that the Lease was validly terminated on February 12, 2018.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Relief from Forfeiture</TI>
<P><P1>52. Section 98 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> and section 20 of the <EM>Commercial Tenancies Act</EM> permit the court to protect a party against the loss of an interest or a right because of a failure to perform a covenant or condition in a contract.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43, section 98; <EM>CTA</EM>, section 20;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Kozel v Personal Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 130</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Kozel</EM>], at paragraph 28</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>53. The remedy is equitable, discretionary and fact-specific. The party seeking the relief bears the onus of establishing the case for relief and the relief should be granted sparingly.

<P1>54. Failure to exercise an option to renew is a failure to crystallize a right, not the loss of a right. As such, equity cannot offer relief from the failure to exercise an option.

<BLOCK2><TI>Tenant not entitled to Relief from Forfeiture with Respect to the Termination of the Lease</TI>
<P><P1>55. In exercising its discretion to grant relief from forfeiture, the Court must consider the conduct of the applicant, the gravity of the breach, and the disparity between the value of the property forfeited and the damage caused by the breach.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Poplar Point First Nation Development Cor. V Thunder Bay (City)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 934</CITE><PARANUM>78</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2></P1>
<P1>56. In the context of default due to non-payment of rent, the Court should consider: &ldquo;(a) whether the tenant comes to court with clean hands; (b) whether there has been an outright refusal to pay rent; (c) whether the rent has been in arrears for a short or long time; and (d) whether the landlord has suffered a serious loss by reason of the moving party's delay in paying rent.&rdquo;
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Michele's Italian Ristorante Inc. v 1272259 Ontario Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4888</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Michele's</EM>], at paragraph 36</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>No Clean Hands</TI>
<P><P1>57. The February 1, 2018 default with respect to the payment of rent was one of many monetary defaults of the Tenant.
<P2>a. In this regard, the Court should draw a negative inference from the Tenant's refusal to provide bank statements and conclude that prior to the Landlord becoming the owner of the Property, there has been a long history of monetary defaults under the Lease.
<P3><CASEREF><SOC>Children's Aid Society, Region of Halton v. M. (M.)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCJ 323</CITE><PARANUM>96</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, citing Gary J. in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Sabanegh v Habaybeh</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 6572</CITE><PARANUM>73</PARANUM></CASEREF></P3></P2>
<P2>b. The Tenant failed to pay monthly rent to its lawyers on the first day of each month, as agreed in the Interim Settlement.</P2>
<P2>c. At the first return of the application, the Tenant was ordered to pay $9,204.17 on account of 2017 property taxes and has been ordered to pay $19,000 on account of 2018 property taxes.</P2></P1>
<P1>58. The Tenant does not have clean hands. The Tenant should have acknowledged the history of monetary default, acknowledged amounts owed to the Landlord and paid those amounts immediately.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Outright Refusal to Pay Rent</TI>
<P><P1>59. The Tenant refuses to pay the monthly amount of $9,693.83, an amount which reflects the 2017 Rent Increase and the full amount of property taxes paid by the Landlord in 2018. Instead, the Tenant pays the pre-increase base rent and additional rent based on a 2017 estimate.</P1>
<P1>60. This refusal to pay rent is sufficient reason to refuse the equitable relief sought by the Tenant on its application.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Other Circumstances</TI>
<P><P1>61. The Tenant's business is the cause of noise and vibration complaints by Residents. The Tenant creates a safety hazard by throwing garbage and other articles at the rear of the Building, thereby blocking fire exits and escape routes. The Tenant's patrons vomit and urinate in and around the front of the Building and disturb Residents leaving and entering the Building. These and other acts and omissions are breaches of the Lease as follows: section 6.07, see paragraphs 35 to 40 above; section 7.08, see paragraphs 35 to 40 above; section 7.10, see paragraph 45 above; paragraph 10 of Schedule C, see paragraph 40 above; and paragraph 15 of Schedule C, see paragraphs 35 to 39 above.</P1>
<P1>62. These breaches prejudice the Residents and make it difficult to lease the ground floor premises and drive Residents from the Building. The interests of stakeholders other than the Tenant have been negatively affected by the Tenant's acts and omissions and as such, the Court should not exercise its discretion to grant the Tenant relief from forfeiture.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Lease was not renewed</TI>
<P><P1>63. A renewal provision in a lease is an option to renew in the form of a unilateral contract. The landlord makes an irrevocable offer to renew if the tenant complies with the terms of the provision.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Premium Properties Ltd. v Subway Franchise Restaurants of Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 3150</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Premium</EM>], at paragraphs 11-12, citing Campbell J in <EM>120 Adelaide</EM>, at paragraphs 11-12</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>64. The Tenant has the onus of demonstrating strict compliance with the conditions of the option to renew/extend.
<P2><BOLD><EM>120 Adelaide</EM>, at paragraphs 12&ndash;14; <EM>Premium</EM>, at paragraph 12</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>65. Strict compliance with the conditions of the option requires explicit and direct, unequivocal communication to the optionor that the right is being exercised. The optionee must actually exercise the option and bind itself unequivocally as a contracting party. A desire or intention to exercise a renewal right is not the actual exercise of the renewal right.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Premium</EM>, at paragraph 13, citing <EM>120 Adelaide</EM>, at paragraphs 38 and 41;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Doria v 66 Degrees Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2000] O.J. No. 136</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. SCJ</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Doria</EM>], at paragraph 8</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>66. It is not sufficient that the parties engage in negotiations with each other, or that the optionee has expressed a will to exercise the option of renewal:
<QUOTE><P>In a lease where there is a requirement for written exercise of an option on or before a stipulated date prior to the end of the lease term, there is little if any doubt that the business rationale for those requirements is to provide both landlord and tenant with certainty as to their future rights and obligations vis a vis each other.</P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Premium</EM>, at paragraph 16, citing Low J in <EM>Doria</EM>, at paragraph 8</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>67. To hold a course of negotiation, without a clear and unambiguous exercise of an option to renew, constitutes a waiver of compliance with the requirements of the option clause, would destroy the certainty the parties bargained for.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Premium</EM>, at paragraph 16, citing Low J in <EM>Doria</EM>, at paragraph 8</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>68. If not being in default of the lease is a condition precedent to the option to renew, the tenant must not be in default not only at the date of the exercise of the option but it must continue not to be in default up to the expiry of the existing term of the lease.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Doria</EM>, at paragraph 10</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>69. The emails provided in undertakings by Michael Assoon, as proof of renewal of the Lease, does not constitute explicit, express, and unequivocal written notice to exercise the option to renew provided in the Lease. The Tenant merely expressed an intention to renew.</P1>
<P1>70. Not being in default of the Lease was a condition precedent to the option to renew. The Tenant was in default not only at the date of the exercise of the option, but continues to be in default under the Lease.</P1>
<P1>71. As such, the Tenant has failed to properly exercise its right of renewal in conformity with the Lease as amended.</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>72. The Landlord respectfully requests an order:
<P1>a. declaring that the Lease has been properly terminated by the Landlord and that the Landlord is entitled to possession of the Premises located in the Building;</P1>
<P1>b. declaring that the Tenant has failed to properly exercise its right of renewal under the Lease;</P1>
<P1>c. that the Tenant deliver vacant possession of the Premises to the Landlord;</P1>
<P1>d. that the Tenant pay the Landlord damages in the amount of $ 100,000;</P1>
<P1>e. costs of the applications on a substantial indemnity basis, together with HST; and</P1>
<P1>f. such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF GASPARE GALATI (Sworn October 4, 2018)</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, GASPARE GALATI</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a partner with the law firm of Daoust Vukovich LLP (&ldquo;<BOLD>Daoust Vukovich</BOLD>&rdquo;), lawyers for the applicant, 2324702 Ontario Inc. (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Tenant</BOLD>&rdquo;), and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except where I have been advised of the same, in which case I believe such information to be true.</P>
<P>2. Daoust Vukovich are the lawyers of record for the Tenant in the above described applications (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Applications</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. By a written lease agreement dated March 1, 2008, the Tenant leased premises municipally located at 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the &ldquo;<UNDER>Premises</UNDER>&rdquo;) from 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the &ldquo;<UNDER>Landlord</UNDER>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. On February 21, 2018, the Tenant commenced an application for an order that the commercial lease agreement between the Tenant and the Landlord is in full force and effect.</P>
<P>5. The Tenant's claim arose from a termination notice left on the floor of the Premises by the Landlord. The alleged basis for the actions of the Landlord is that the Tenant did not pay rent for the month of February 2018.</P>
<P>6. On July 12, 2018, the Landlord commenced an application for:
<P1>a. a determination of the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to the Lease;</P1>
<P1>b. a declaration that the Lease had been properly terminated;</P1>
<P1>c. in the alternative to the relief set out in paragraph (b), a declaration that the Tenant has failed to properly exercise its right of renewal under the Lease; and</P1>
<P1>d. an order that the Tenant pay the Landlord the amount of $50,000 on account of outstanding rent.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Current Status of the Litigation</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Both parties have served a notice of application and affidavit evidence. Copies of the notices of application and are attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>8. Some of the cross-examinations have taken place. There are still cross-examinations outstanding.</P>
<P>9. The parties appeared in front of Justice Nakatsuru on September 11, 2018 to adjoun the Applications and set a new schedule. Justice Nakatsuru held that the parties shall adhere to the following schedule:
<P1>a. all cross-examinations to be completed by October 30, 2018;</P1>
<P1>b. all undertakings to be completed within 14 days after cross-examinations are complete;</P1>
<P1>c. there will be an applicant's factum filed and served two weeks before December 7, 2018;</P1>
<P1>d. there will be a respondent's factum filed and served one week before December 7, 2018;</P1>
<P1>e. any reply facta to be served and filed four days before December 7, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>f. the application will be heard on December 7, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>A copy of Justice Nakatsuru's endorsement is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Breakdown of solicitor-client relationship and failure to pay fees</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. Daoust Vukovich's retainer agreement with the Tenant states that Daoust Vukovich may terminate its services for any of the following reasons: a) failure to pay our retainer; b) failure to co-operate with us in any reasonable request; c) failure to pay our accounts when rendered; and/or d) continuing to act would become unethical or impractical. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the retainer letter dated February 16, 2018.</P>
<P>11. The solicitor-client relationship with the Tenant has broken down. The Tenant has delivered several NSF cheques to Daoust Vukovich. The Tenant has also failed to pay our fees, which are $11,587.98.</P>
<P>12. I have been advised, and do verily believe, that Daniel Waldman (&ldquo;<BOLD>Waldman</BOLD>&rdquo;), an associate at Daoust Vukovich, advised the Tenant that we will be removing ourselves from the record. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of email correspondence between Waldman and the Tenant dated September 12, 2018.</P>
<P>13. I have been advised and do verily believe that the Tenant advised Waldman that the Tenant would be retaining a new lawyer by September 14, 2018. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of email correspondence between the Tenant and Waldman dated September 13, 2018.</P>
<P>14. The Tenant has failed to inform us whether the Tenant has retained a new lawyer.</P>
<P>15. I have advised the Tenant that if the Tenant has not retained a new lawyer by October 5, 2018, that we will be bringing a motion for an order removing Daoust Vukovich as solicitors of record.</P>
<P>16. The Tenant can be served at 1305B Dundas West, Toronto, Ontario, M6J 1X8.</P>
<P>17. I make this affidavit in support of a motion for an order removing Daoust Vukovich LLP as solicitors of record and for no other purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF EVAN PRESVELOS (Sworn November 22, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, Evan Presvelos, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a Partner with Presvelos Law LLP and, as such, have been involved in the matters that gave rise to this proceeding to which I depose hereinafter. Where my knowledge is based on the information of others, or is based upon a review of documents, I have stated the source of my information and verily believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. This is a motion to amend a timetable for the delivery of materials with respect to the within Application (CV-18-592504) and Cross-Application (CV-18-00601413-0000).</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>A New Timetable is Required</TI>
<P>3. On September 11, 2018, Justice Nakatsuru made an Endorsement which, among other things, established a timetable to move along the Application and Cross Application. The timetable outlined the following deliverables and dates:
<P1>(a) All cross-examinations to be completed by October 30, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) All undertakings to be complete within 14 days after;</P1>
<P1>(c) Applicant's facta to be served and filed 2 weeks before December 7, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Responding facta to be filed and served 1 week before December 7, 2018; and,</P1>
<P1>(e) Any reply factum to be served and filed 4 days before December 7, 2018.</P1>
<P1>Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Endorsement dated September 11, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>4. On October 12, 2018, Mr. Daniel Waldman, at that time counsel for the Applicant, appeared before Justice Nakatsuru to be removed as the lawyer of record (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Removal Order&rdquo;</BOLD>). The Removal Order required the Applicant to appoint a new lawyer within thirty (30) days. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Removal Order dated October 12, 2018.</P>
<P>5. I am advised by Mr. Sam A. Presvelos that he was retained by the Applicant on November 9, 2018.</P>
<P>6. On November 12, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos served the Respondent's lawyer, Mr. Julian Binavince, with a Notice of Appointment of Lawyer. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Notice of Appointment of Lawyer and fax confirmation.</P>
<P>7. On November 13, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos contacted Mr. Waldman to obtain a complete copy of the file. Mr. Walderman declined to provide the file and asserted a solicitor's lien on the Applicant's file. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the email exchange between S. Presvelos and Mr. Waldman dated November 13, 2018.</P>
<P>8. On November 14, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos contacted Ms. Michelle Chen, requesting an urgent motion or chambers meeting with Justice Nakatsuru to discuss the timetable in place for this matter. Ms. Chen advised that Justice Nakatsuru was not sitting until November 26, 20 18. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the email exchange between Mr. S. Presvelos and Ms. Chen dated November 14, 2018.</P>
<P>9. On November 14, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos asked Mr. Binavince to provide him with a copy of the materials served for the Application and Cross-Application. Mr. Binavince did not reply. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Mr. S. Presvelos' email to Mr. Binavince dated November 14, 2018.</P>
<P>10. On November 14, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos obtained transcripts from the cross -examinations on the parties' affidavits. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of an email attaching the transcripts.</P>
<P>11. At this time, I am advised by Mr. S. Presvelos that he did not yet have a copy of the following key documents:
<P1>(a) The Applicant's Application Record;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Applicant's Supplementary Application Record; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The Respondent's Supplementary Application Record.</P1></P>
<P>12. On November 15, 2018, Ms. Gladdys R. Gabbidon, Assistant to Justice Nakatsuru, informed Mr. S. Presvelos that Justice Nakatsuru requested a teleconference for November 22, 2018 at 9:30 am. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Ms. Gabbidon's email to Mr. S. Presvelos dated November 15, 2018.</P>
<P>13. Mr. S. Presvelos immediately forwarded Ms. Gabbidon's email to Mr. Binavince. Mr. Binavince did not respond. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the email being forwarded to Mr. Binavince.</P>
<P>14. On November 19, 2018, Mr. S. Presvelos again contacted Mr. Binavince, asking him to a copy of the responding record, supplementary record and factum that was served in the Application and Cross-Application. Mr. Binavince did not respond. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Mr. S. Presvelos' email to Mr. Binavince dated November 19, 2018.</P>
<P>15. According to the Endorsement's timetable, the parties were to serve their factums by November 23, 2018&mdash;two weeks before December 7, 2018.</P>
<P>16. To date, Mr. S. Presvelos has been unable to obtain a complete copy of the record in the Application and Cross-Application.</P>
<P>17. I am advised by Mr. S. Presvelos that he spoke with Justice Nakatsuru on the morning of November 22, 2018, as previously arranged with Ms. Gabbidon. Mr. Binavince did not participate on the call.</P>
<P>18. I am advised by Mr. S. Presvelos that, on November 22, 2018, he called Mr. Binavince to inform him as to the outcome of the teleconference with Justice Nakatsuru. At this time, Mr. Binavince apologized for not responding to Mr. S. Presvelos' emails and for being absent on the call earlier that morning. For the first time, Mr. Binavince advised Mr. S. Presvelos that he would provide him with a copy of all materials that were served in the Application and Cross -Application. In addition, while Mr. Binavince refused to consent to an amended timetable, he agreed with Mr. S. Presvelos on a tentative timetable in the event this Honourable Court orders a new timetable be put in place. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of a draft timetable.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Applicant has Complied with the Endorsement</TI>
<P>19. The Endorsement also imposed the following requirements upon the Applicant:
<P1>(a) To pay all money in trust by Mr. Walderman to the respondent, as part of the rent owing;</P1>
<P1>(b) Pay the Respondent rent in accordance with the existing contractual arrangement;</P1>
<P1>(c) Pay the Respondent $9,204.17 as partial payment for 2017 realty taxes, until a final decision is made;</P1>
<P1>(d) By December 6, 2018, to pay $19,000 to its counsel, in trust, as payment for 2018 realty taxes until the final amount is decided by His Honour.</P1></P>
<P>20. I am advised by Mr. S. Presvelos that the Applicant has made the required payments to the Respondent.</P>
<P>21. I am advised by Mr. S. Presvelos that Mr. Binavince has taken the position that the Applicant has failed to pay its rent in accordance with the existing contractual arrangement. According to Mr. Binavince there is certain realty tax outstanding. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the property tax arrears that Mr. Binavince prepared.</P>
<P>22. The parties entered into a Lease Amending Agreement dated September 5, 2013. The Lease Amending Agreement extended the lease until October 1, 2018, with an option to renew for another five (5) years. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Lease Amending Agreement.</P>
<P>23. According to the Lease Amending Agreement the base rent up and until September 31, 2018 was $5,166.67. Thereafter, the new basic rent rate &ldquo;shall be the then fair market Minimum Rent rate for comparable premises in the area&rdquo;. Moreover, in the event the parties cannot agree on the new Minimum Rent, the parties are required to arbitrate the issue in accordance with the <EM>Arbitration Act</EM>, 1991.</P>
<P>24. I am advised that the Applicant has not been given a formal notice of any rent increase and, in fact, previously requested that the parties discuss this matter.</P>
<P>25. I make this Affidavit in support of the motion to amend the timetable contained in the Endorsement as well as a Declaration that the Applicant has complied with the Endorsement and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF POUNEH ROUHANI</TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>POUNEH ROUHANI</BOLD>, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY (or <EM>AFFIRM):</EM></P>
<P>1. I am a principal of the respondent/applicant, 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>) and I share responsibility for tenant matters and management with respect to the building located at 1305 Dundas West, Toronto. I have reviewed the file with respect to this matter and I have also spoken with Julian Binavince, the lawyer with carriage of this matter. As such, I have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed, except where stated otherwise, in which case I believe such information to be true.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Brief Procedural History</TI>
<P>2. The within application was commenced on or about February 21, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Application&rdquo;</BOLD>) by 2324702 Ontario Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</BOLD>). The application bearing court file no. CV-18-00601413-0000 was commenced on or about July 12, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Cross-application&rdquo;</BOLD>) by the Landlord.</P>
<P>3. This affidavit is to be read in conjunction with all other materials filed with the court for the Application and Cross-Application and I make this affidavit in accordance with the endorsement of Justice Nakatsuru dated November 26, 2.018, a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. The Application and Cross-application relates to a commercial lease with respect to the premises in the basement of the building having the municipal address 1305 Dundas Street West, Toronto (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Lease&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Order of Justice Nakatsuru</TI>
<P>5. On September 11, 2018, Justice Nakatsuru ordered the following order:
<P1>a. &ldquo;Going forward, the applicant shall pay rent directly to the respondent in accordance with the existing contractual arrangement;&rdquo; and</P1>
<P1>b. &ldquo;The applicant shall pay to its counsel the amount of $19,000, to be held by Mr. Walderman in trust. This amount is to be considered as a payment with respect to the 2018 realty tax until I decide what the exact amount is owing. This amount shall be paid into trust before the hearing of the application. By December 6, 2018 at the latest. Counsel for the applicant shall notify counsel for the respondent when that amount has been paid into trust.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the endorsement of Justice Nakatsuru dated September 11, 2018 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;September Order&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1></P>
<P>6. The Applicant has breached the September Order numerous times with respect to the payment of rent &ldquo;in accordance with the existing contractual arrangement&rdquo;. In this regard, based on my review of the Lease, rent is due on the first day of each month:
<P1>a. The Tenant paid rent for October 2018 two days late, namely on October 3, 2018;</P1>
<P1>b. The rent cheque for December 2018 was returned by the Landlord's bank. A replacement draft was delivered, but has not been negotiated. In this regard, attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy the returned cheque; and</P1>
<P1>c. The rent for January 2019 was paid by way of bank draft a day late, namely on January 2, 2019 but such draft has not been negotiated.</P1></P>
<P>7. Since the Landlord became the landlord by way of assignment, the Tenant has only paid the amount of $7,274.00 on account of rent, despite increases in base rent, despite increases in additional rent (on account of property taxes) and despite the expiration of the Lease and the triggering of &ldquo;overholding&rdquo; rent.</P>
<P>8. With respect to the payment of overholding rent, attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email exchange between counsel for the parties, confirming that the Landlord requires the Tenant to pay &ldquo;overholding&rdquo; rent after the expiration of the term of the Lease.</P>
<P>9. The Tenant has failed to pay the amount of &ldquo;$19,000 paid into trust before December 6, 2018&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<BOLD>2018 Realty Tax Payment</BOLD>&rdquo;) as required by the September Order. In this regard, attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is the email exchange between counsel dated December 17, 2018 with respect to the 2018 Realty Tax Payment.</P>
<P>10. I make this affidavit in support of the Landlord's motion to dismiss the Tenant's application and for a declaration that the Lease is at an end.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF MICHAEL ASSOON (Sworn February 13, 2018)</TI>
<P>I, Michael Assoon, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am the Principal of the Applicant company, 2324702 Ontario Inc., and, as such, have been involved in the matters that gave rise to this proceeding to which I depose hereinafter. Where my knowledge is based on the information of others, or is based upon a review of documents, I have stated the source of my information and verily believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have reviewed the Affidavit of Pouneh Rouhani sworn February 8, 2019 and the exhibits attached thereto.</P>
<P>3. Ms. Rouhani's Affidavit makes it evident that the Respondent is focused on using technical issues as the basis to terminate our tenancy with 1305 Dundas W Inc. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>4. Ms. Rouhani takes issue with the fact that rent for October was paid two days late. The fact is that sometimes there are delays with our credit card and debit card processing. As a result, other costs involved in running our business sometimes uses part of the money we otherwise have set aside in our bank account for rent. It has never been our intention to pay our rent late. In any event, we have always sought to rectify this issue as soon as possible.</P>
<P>5. With respect to the December 2018 rent, the first of the month was a Saturday. In any event, we immediately paid the rent after we became aware the cheque was returned. The rent was paid by bank draft dated December 4, 2018. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the bank draft dated December 4, 2018.</P>
<P>6. With respect to the January 2019 rent, January 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 2019 is New Year's Day, a holiday, which is why rent was paid the following day.</P>
<P>7. With respect to the rent and rent increase, first, we have been unable to amicably and reasonably work with the Landlord to resolve this issue and, second, we are under the impression that this matter would be dealt with finally upon hearing of this application.</P>
<P>8. With respect to our alleged failure to pay $19,000 into trust before December 6, 2018, it was our understanding that these funds were required to be deposited into court before the application hearing date. In fact, the most recent endorsement dated November 16, 2018 explicitly vacates the previous endorsement which required the $19,000 to be deposited into trust before December 6, 2018.</P>
<P>9. I make this Affidavit in response to the Landlord's motion to have this application dismissed and for no other or improper purposes.</P>
