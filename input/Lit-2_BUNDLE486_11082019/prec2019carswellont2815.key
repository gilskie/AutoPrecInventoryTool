<P><BOLD>TRADERS GENERAL APPEALS</BOLD> to the Divisional Court from the Decision of Adjudicator Christopher A. Ferguson of the Licence Appeal Tribunal, dated February 5, 2018</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that this Honourable Court set aside Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson, and that a Judgment be made as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Respondent, Ms. Rumball, is precluded from proceeding with her application for dispute resolution for Income Replacement Benefits by operation of the two year limitation period set out at section 56 of the <EM>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</EM>, O.Reg. 34/10 (&ldquo;the <EM>Schedule</EM>&rdquo;);</P>

<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem Just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>

<P>6. Adjudicator Ferguson erred in law in applying a rolling limitation period to disputes under the <EM>Schedule</EM>, contrary to binding Court of Appeal precedent and the language of section 56 of the <EM>Schedule</EM>.</P>
<P>7. Adjudicator Ferguson misapprehended the evidence and facts to such a degree that it amounts to a serious error of law.</P>
<P>8. Adjudicator Ferguson's factual determinations could not be made on the evidence before him, and constitutes a serious error of law.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>I. OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Traders General Insurance Company (&ldquo;Traders&rdquo;) Appeals from the decision of Adjudicator Christopher A. Ferguson of the Licence Appeal Tribunal (&ldquo;the Tribunal&rdquo;), dated February 5, 2018.</P>
<P>2. This Appeal is about Ms. Shelley Rumball's claim for Income Replacement Benefits (&ldquo;IRBs&rdquo;), which was terminated by Traders on March 4, 2015. She did not challenge her IRB termination until July 17, 2017, more than two years after the clear and unequivocal termination of IRB, when she filed an application for dispute resolution with the Tribunal.</P>
<P>3. Traders raised a preliminary issue before the Tribunal, seeking the dismissal of Ms. Rumball's IRB dispute on the basis that the two year limitation period under the <EM>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</EM> (&ldquo;the <EM>Schedule</EM>&rdquo;) had expired.</P>
<P>4. Adjudicator Ferguson dismissed the preliminary issue hearing, after completely misapplying the test for limitations in accident benefits cases. The adjudicator improperly held that the termination letter left open the possibility of future re-applications for IRB, and was thus not clear and unequivocal. This reading is a clear error of law, where the <EM>Schedule</EM> provides for only one application for IRB arising out of an accident. In other words, the adjudicator found that the termination letter was not clear and unequivocal based on a misconceived notion of rights that do not exist under the <EM>Schedule</EM>.</P>
<P>5. Adjudicator Ferguson ignored the fact that Traders' termination letter clearly and unequivocally terminated Ms. Rumball's IRB based on her return to work, and provided a detailed explanation of her right to dispute the refusal to pay IRB. His decision clearly demonstrates a misapprehension of the first party insurance relationship, which requires an insurer to adjust claims in good faith on an ongoing basis. His finding amounts to a determination that the limitations period in accident benefits cases is a rolling one. It amounts to a statement that, notwithstanding the fact that Traders clearly and unequivocally terminated Mr. Rumball's IRB and provided a detailed explanation of her right to dispute the termination, the limitation period could not be relied upon.</P>
<P>6. This interpretation has been expressly and universally rejected in an uninterrupted line of Court of Appeal decisions spanning nearly two decades. These decisions reflect the language of the limitations provision in the <EM>Schedule</EM>, which were chosen by the legislature to create certainty and finality in accident benefits claims.</P>
<P>7. Adjudicator Ferguson's decision is contrary to the plain language of the <EM>Schedule</EM>, and amounts to a serious error of law. Traders seeks an Order overturning the decision of Adjudicator Ferguson, and holding that Ms. Rumball is precluded from proceeding in her IRB claim by operation of the limitation period under the <EM>Schedule</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. Ms. Rumball was involved in a minor motor vehicle accident on December 28, 2014. She applied for statutory accident benefits with Traders. Among the accident benefits claimed, Ms. Rumball applied for IRB with the submission of a Disability Certificate (&ldquo;OCF-3&rdquo;) on January 23, 2015 and an Employer's Confirmation Form (&ldquo;OCF-2&rdquo;) on February 23, 2015.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>OCF-3 dated January 21, 2015.</BOLD></P2>

<P2><BOLD>OCF-2 dated February 15, 2015.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 5.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>9. By way of letter dated March 4, 2015, Traders acknowledged receipt of Ms. Rumball's OCF-2, and indicated that it had approved her application for IRB. Traders advised that it agreed to pay IRB from January 4, 2015, the end of the 7-day exclusionary period, to February 25, 2015, the date Ms. Rumball returned to work.

<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 1.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>10. In the table under the words &ldquo;Explanation of Benefits,&rdquo; Traders clearly and unequivocally noted &ldquo;Income Replacement Benefits: no longer eligible.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 1.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>11. In the body of this letter, Traders clearly and unequivocally terminated Ms. Rumball's IRB:
<QUOTE><P>As per Section 37(2)(e) of the <EM>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</EM> (SABS), we are therefore terminating your IRB effective February 25, 2015 as you have resumed your preaccident employment duties.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 1.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>12. In that same paragraph, Traders also indicated &ldquo;[s]hould you be off work again due to the injuries sustained as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident, we would require an updated Disability Certificate (OCF-3) to determine your eligibility.&rdquo; This statement was clearly not a request for an OCF-3. There was also no implicit recognition of entitlement in this language, which was, at most, an extension of Traders' duty to adjust claims in good faith and consider new evidence when and if presented with it.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 1.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>13. In the very next paragraph, Traders provided Ms. Rumball with information relating to her right to dispute the decision to terminate her IRB:
<QUOTE><P>Should you wish to dispute this decision please refer to the Applicant's Right to Dispute on the following pages. Your first step is to apply for mediation. Should you require information regarding your rights to dispute or the appropriate forms please do not hesitate to contact the writer. Please ensure you initiate your dispute within <BOLD>TWO YEARS</BOLD>. [emphasis in original]</P></QUOTE>

<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 2.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>14. Traders provided a detailed, step-by-step description of Ms. Rumball's right to dispute the termination, and set out the applicable two year limitation period in capitalized, bolded letters. The March 4, 2015 letter clearly identified that the limitation period began to run from the insurer's refusal to pay the benefit claimed.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Letter dated March 4, 2015, page 3.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 6.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>15. Ms. Rumball did not provide a further OCF-3 to Traders prior to the expiry of the limitation period on March 4, 2017, nor did she commence any dispute resolution proceeding by that date.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Ms. Rumball's Dispute Resolution Proceeding</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>16. Ms. Rumball did not dispute Traders' termination of IRB until July 17, 2017, when she submitted an Application by an Injured Person with the Tribunal.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Application by an Injured Person, dated July 17, 2017.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 7.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>17. At the case conference in the proceeding below (which is akin to a pre-trial conference in civil litigation in which the parties identify and narrow issues, attempt settlement, and establish the parameters for the hearing), Traders raised a preliminary issue that Ms. Rumball was statute barred from proceeding with her IRB dispute, as she had failed to dispute the termination of her IRB within two years of denial. At the case conference, the Tribunal scheduled a preliminary issue hearing on the limitation issue.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Case Conference Report of Adjudicator Msosa, October 31, 2017.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 8.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>18. Following the case conference, and based on Traders' raising of a preliminary issue, Ms. Rumball submitted a new OCF-3 to Traders on October 26, 2017. The OCF-3 was back dated to June 13, 2017, which is at any rate outside of the limitations period that expired on March 4, 2017.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>OCF-3 dated June 13, 2017, submitted October 26, 2017.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 9.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>19. Traders wrote Ms. Rumball on November 3, 2017, acknowledging receipt of the new OCF-3. Traders clearly reiterated that the IRB was terminated on March 4, 2015, and that the two year limitation period had expired. Traders explicitly indicated that the termination of IRB dated March 4, 2015 was unchanged.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Letter dated November 3, 2017.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 10.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>20. In his decision, Adjudicator Ferguson dismissed the preliminary issue hearing brought by Traders. He misapprehended the test of limitations periods in accident benefits cases, which is clearly demonstrated in his rejection of the multitude of Court of Appeal decisions placed before him.</P>
<P>21. Adjudicator Ferguson failed to identify or discuss the actual termination language found in the March 4, 2015 termination letter. He failed to discuss the fact that Traders had set out the step-by-step process by which Ms. Rumball could dispute the termination of her IRB. The adjudicator does, however, identify that Traders did inform Ms. Rumball that it had terminated her IRB, and that it provided the reason for the termination.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson, dated February 5, 2018, para. 11.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 2.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>22. Instead, the adjudicator focused on portions of the letter that were clearly and squarely directed at fulfilling Traders' ongoing duty of good faith in a first party insurance relationship. At paragraph 25 of his decision dismissing the preliminary issue raised by Traders, Adjudicator Ferguson held that the IRB stoppage letter dated March 4, 2015 was not clear and unequivocal because:
<P1>a. He interpreted the letter to inform Ms. Rumball that she remained eligible for IRB should she subsequently leave work due to her accident-related injuries, if she submitted a new OCF-3 to allow Traders General to determine her eligibility;</P1>
<P1>b. The letter lacks a statement that an updated OCF-3 would only be considered if sent within two years of the letter of termination, though the letter does provide a warning that a two-year limitation period applied to dispute the termination of benefits;</P1>
<P1>c. The notice of a limitation was equivocal because the phrase &ldquo;this decision&rdquo; in the letter referred to the March 4, 2015 stoppage alone, and not possible future decisions on subsequent IRB claims;</P1>
<P1>d. The warning of a two-year time limit on commencing a dispute does not set the limitation period running on future IRB claims;</P1>
<P1>e. The ambiguity in leaving the possibility of future re-applications for IRB should be interpreted in favour of the insured, applying the contract-law doctrine of <EM>contra proferentum</EM>.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson, dated February 5, 2018, para. 25.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 2.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>23. In essence, the adjudicator found that the March 4, 2015 letter was not clear and unequivocal because it left open the possibility that Ms. Rumball could re-apply for IRB in the future. This reading is completely incorrect at law, and flies in the face of all Court of Appeal case law and the plain language of the <EM>Schedule</EM>.</P>
<P>24. At the request of Ms. Rumball's lawyer, an associate under Mr. Fabio Longo, the Tribunal amended the decision to include his name on the decision, and to properly identify the parties represented by each counsel. The amended decision was issued on February 13, 2018, and contains no substantive changes to the original decision.

<P>28. The Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that the existence of a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative tribunal does not exclude that decision from administrative law principles. This is true even in instances where the statutory right of appeal limited appeals to a question of law alone. As such, where an appeal is taken from the decision of an administrative tribunal, the standard of review analysis will be the same as that undertaken on judicial review.

<P>29. The two standards of review to be applied by a court in reviewing the decision of an administrative tribunal are correctness and reasonableness. In a standard of review analysis, the Court must first ascertain whether existing case law has already determined the degree of deference to be accorded to the decisions of the administrative tribunal.

<P>41. In a recent reconsideration decision, the Executive Chair of SLASTO, which is the cluster of tribunals which include the License Appeals Tribunal, held that a refusal to pay benefits is not dependent on any specific wording, and that a clear statement by an insurer that it refused to pay benefits after a specific date was a clear and unequivocal denial. Such notice, in conjunction with an explanation of the right to dispute, is sufficient to commence the limitation period under the <EM>Schedule</EM>.

<P>42. Adjudicator Ferguson defines unequivocal as &ldquo;clear, plain; capable of being understood in only one way, or clearly demonstrated; free from uncertainty, or without doubt . . . .&rdquo; He goes on to note that a denial must be &ldquo;in straightforward and clear language, directed towards an unsophisticated person.&rdquo; These definitions are not contentious, and Traders does not challenge them.

<P2><BOLD>Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson, dated February 5, 2018, para. 21.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Compendium of the Appellant, TAB 2.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>43. It is difficult to see how the phrase &ldquo;we are therefore terminating your IRB effective February 25, 2015 as you have resumed your pre-accident employment duties&rdquo; is in any way unclear, uncertain, doubtful. This sentence is only capable of being understood in one way, and is written in a straightforward and clear language. This letter is clear and unequivocal. It leads only to one conclusion&mdash;that Traders refused to pay IRB beyond February 25, 2015 because Ms. Rumball had returned to work.</P>
<P>44. The reason given by Traders is sufficiently clear to allow Ms. Rumball to decide whether she wished to challenge the termination. If Ms. Rumball had stopped working as a result of the accident after February 25, 2015, she was fully capable of challenging Traders' termination of IRB through dispute resolution within two years. The process and time limit was explained to her, as outlined below. She did not do so.</P>
<P>45. There was nothing in the March 4, 2015 letter that detracted from Ms. Rumball's ability to decide whether to challenge Traders' refusal to pay benefits. Even if, as Ms. Rumball claims, Traders &ldquo;invited&rdquo; her to submit a new OCF-3 to reconsider the termination, Ms. Rumball still knew that Traders refused to pay IRB beyond February 25, 2015, and the reasons for this refusal. This refusal to pay IRB triggered the limitation period, which expired on March 4, 2017.</P>
<P>46. Adjudicator Ferguson does not address this language at all in his decision. He fails to address the clear statement in the letter box which states &ldquo;Income Replacement Benefit: no longer eligible.&rdquo; This is yet another clear and unequivocal statement that Traders refused to pay the IRB claimed by Ms. Rumball.</P>
<P>47. Instead of reproducing or acknowledging any of the above language, which clearly states that the IRB was terminated, Adjudicator Ferguson does note that Traders advised that the IRB was &ldquo;stopped.&rdquo; The use of a different word does not alter the fact that the adjudicator did, in fact, identify that there was a clear refusal to pay ongoing IRB as of February 25, 2015, and that reasons for that refusal were provided for the refusal. The adjudicator did not find that the refusal or reasons were insufficient for Ms. Rumball to decide whether she would dispute the termination.</P>
<P>48. Adjudicator Ferguson failed to provide reasons for the insufficiency of this clear and unequivocal termination. Instead, the adjudicator found the denial ambiguous, based on different language discussing an OCF-3. His reason for those findings was similarly unreasonable, and was based on a misconception that Ms. Rumball was entitled to make a second application for IRBs.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>The Insurer Must Notify the Insured Person of the Dispute Resolution Process and Time Limit</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>49. In addition to a clear and unequivocal refusal to pay a claimed benefit, the <EM>Schedule</EM> requires that the insurer provide a written notice specifying the most important steps required to dispute the refusal. The Supreme Court of Canada has articulated a number of requirements for an insurer to satisfy for there to be a valid refusal of benefits:
<P1>A. The insurer must use straightforward and clear language to inform a person of the dispute resolution process;</P1>
<P1>B. The language is to be directed to an unsophisticated person; and</P1>
<P1>C. At a minimum there should be a description of the most important points of the process, such as:
<P2>I. the right to seek mediation,</P2>
<P2>II. the right to arbitrate or litigate if mediation fails,</P2>
<P2>III. that mediation must be attempted before starting arbitration or litigation,</P2>
<P2>IV. and the relevant time limits that govern the entire process.</P2></P1>

<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Appellant, TAB J.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>50. The Court of Appeal has held that the underpinning of the consumer protection rationale is the need to ensure that an insured person is properly informed about the dispute resolution process and relevant time limits at the time that the insurer refuses to pay benefits. Where the insurer invites the insured person to ask the insurer for assistance with obtaining dispute resolution forms or for further assistance in the dispute resolution process, this is further evidence that the consumer protection purpose is fulfilled such that a proper refusal has been given.

<P2><BOLD>Book of Authorities of the Appellant, TAB K.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>51. It is obvious on the face of the March 4, 2015 letter that Traders did inform Ms. Rumball of the dispute resolution process and two-year time limit.</P>
<P>52. Moreover, Traders invited Ms. Rumball to call and obtain further detail on the dispute resolution process, or if she needed assistance in obtaining the proper forms in connection with Traders' decision to terminate IRB. There is no doubt that the <EM>Smith</EM> requirements were adhered to by Traders, and that Ms. Rumball was made aware of the dispute resolution process in plain language.</P>
<P>53. In other words, the March 4, 2015 letter clearly and unequivocally indicated that Traders refused to pay IRB after February 25, 2015, that this refusal was based on her return to work, and that Ms. Rumball could take steps to dispute the refusal within two years of the date of the letter. It fulfils all requirements under <EM>Smith</EM>, <EM>Zeppieri</EM>, and a plethora of other Court of Appeal decisions discussed in further detail below.</P>
<P>54. In spite of these points, Adjudicator Ferguson found that the language of the letter was too restrictive to effectively convey the fact that the dispute resolution process related to the refusal to pay IRB. The adjudicator found that the use of the term &ldquo;<EM>this decision</EM>&rdquo; rendered the denial equivocal, as he found it unclear whether this related to the immediate termination or to a future IRB claim advanced under a new OCF-3.</P>
<P>55. Of note, the March 4, 2015 letter informs Ms. Rumball of her right to dispute &ldquo;this decision,&rdquo; and indicated that the first step is mediation. It is unclear how the adjudicator could have interpreted this paragraph of the letter, which discussed dispute resolution, to indicate that Ms. Rumball could make future IRB applications. The determination referred to by Traders clearly relates to the termination of IRB, which was clearly and unequivocally made on the preceding page of the termination letter. There is only one decision conveyed&mdash;that Ms. Rumball's IRB had been terminated by Traders.</P>
<P>56. It appears that Adjudicator Ferguson improperly looked beyond the language of the March 4, 2015 termination letter to inform his interpretation of &ldquo;this decision.&rdquo; He indicated that this was &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; language used by Traders, and referenced a second letter that was submitted by Ms. Rumball as forming part of his decision. This is unreasonable and based on extrinsic correspondence that is irrelevant to the limitations question.

<P>57. In other words, Adjudicator Ferguson's interpretation that a reference to &ldquo;this decision&rdquo; referred to a future re-application for IRB is not only completely untenable, but demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the objective test of limitations. The adjudicator's decision is unreasonable.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Representation by Counsel is a Relevant Factor to Consider</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>58. Case law confirms that representation by legal counsel is a factor to be considered in a limitations analysis. Once an insured person retains counsel, she cannot continue to plead ignorance of the termination or claim that a denial was unreasonable because she is unsophisticated. Where an insured person is represented by counsel, or retains counsel following a refusal, that counsel would have known that the limitation period is running.

<P>60. Adjudicator Ferguson did not address any of these arguments, nor did he acknowledge the fact that Ms. Rumball was represented by competent counsel who failed to take note of the relevant limitation period. Instead, several months after the limitation period had expired, Ms. Rumball advanced an unsupported technical argument that Traders' March 4, 2015 termination letter was not clear and unequivocal, based on a narrow and fantastical reading of an otherwise clear sentence.</P>
<P>61. This argument is patently disingenuous. It is clear that both Ms. Rumball and her lawyer knew that IRB had been terminated as of February 25, 2015, yet she slept on her rights for more than two years without any explanation. Ms. Rumball's argument that representation is of no relevance to the limitations analysis is clearly incorrect, and it was unreasonable for Adjudicator Ferguson to ignore the fact that she was represented by counsel.</P>
<P>62. This is the exact outcome that the legislature sought to avoid in drafting section 56 of the <EM>Schedule</EM>, as has been recognized by the Court of Appeal in interpreting the limitation provisions of the <EM>Schedule</EM>.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Adjudicator Ferguson's Findings are Unreasonable</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>63. Where the reasonableness standard of review is concerned with justification and intelligibility within the decision making process, Adjudicator Ferguson's decision falls well below this standard. While it is true that a decision maker need not make mention every factor that informs his or her decision, the absence of the most important feature of the March 4, 2015 letter, the actual refusal, must be viewed as unreasonable.</P>
<P>64. The only points of analysis relevant to the preliminary issue decision were whether a) Traders provided a clear and unequivocal refusal to pay the IRB claimed; and b) whether Traders provided Ms. Rumball with a description of her right to dispute the termination. Adjudicator Ferguson completely ignored these factors, and chose to focus on a completely irrelevant portion of the letter that had no effect under the <EM>Schedule</EM> or controlling case law.</P>
<P>65. The termination language employed by Traders could not be more clear and unequivocal. The letter clearly includes a termination date, a detailed explanation of Ms. Rumball's right to dispute (and an informal description of the dispute process in everyday language), along with a clear disclaimer that she had two years to bring a dispute. Ms. Rumball was provided sufficient information upon which she could decide whether or not she wished to dispute the refusal to pay. These are the only factors relevant under <EM>Smith, Zeppieri</EM>, and the <EM>Schedule</EM>.</P>
<P>66. The effect of Adjudicator Ferguson's decision is to say that Traders never terminated or refused to pay Ms. Rumball's IRB claim, in spite of the fact that Traders clearly and unequivocally advised, in writing, that it refused to pay IRB beyond February 25, 2015. This does not fall within a range of acceptable outcomes, and is an absurd result.</P>
<P>67. In short, the decision of Adjudicator Ferguson is wholly unreasonable, and amounts to a significant error of law. To accept Adjudicator Ferguson's interpretation would be to render the limitation provisions of the <EM>Schedule</EM> meaningless, and cannot stand.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>68. It is a well-established principle that one single claim for specified benefits (including all categories of weekly benefits, namely IRB, Non-Earner Benefits or Caregiver Benefits) arises out of a motor vehicle accident. There is no provision in the past or present iterations of the <EM>Schedule</EM> that allow an insured person to reapply for specified benefits after these benefits have been terminated by an insurer. Where an insurer has refused to pay a benefit claimed, the only remedy for an insured person is to appeal the termination within two years of the refusal.

<P>69. This proposition, espoused by the Court of Appeal in nothing less than 5 decisions dating back as many as 17 years, is binding on the Tribunal, and is a fundamental tenet of the no fault accident benefits system. The legislature clearly intended a bright-line limitation period in accident benefits claims. This principle has also been clearly accepted by the Executive Chair of SLASTO, also binding on the Tribunal, who has unequivocally followed the above decisions.

<P>70. Moreover, decisions of the Court of Appeal and Tribunal have consistently held that a refusal to pay benefits can still be valid even if it is premature, and even if it relates to claims that have yet to crystallize. Further, the reasons for the refusal to pay need not be legally correct. In short, the only relevant consideration is whether there was a clear and unequivocal refusal to pay a benefit claimed, and whether the insured person's right to dispute the refusal and the two year limitation period was explained in writing.

<P>71. Based on the above decisions alone, the reasons provided by Adjudicator Ferguson at Paragraph 25 of his decision are unreasonable and untenable at law. These reasons, which the adjudicator finds to be the sole reasons that the termination was not clear and unequivocal, are not relevant and are contrary to longstanding, binding precedent. By focusing on irrelevant considerations, Adjudicator Ferguson's decision is unreasonable and outside of the range of acceptable outcomes.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>72. Adjudicator Ferguson's interpretation of the letter of termination is to give it the effect of a standstill agreement or waiver of limitation. There is no such agreement or waiver implicit in the termination letter, which purported to terminate Ms. Rumball's IRB on a specific date.</P>

At most, the letter informs Ms. Rumball that she would be required to provide a new OCF- 3 if her circumstances changed such that she had to go off work again as a result of her accident-related injuries. It does not state that IRB would be paid. This is nothing more than an expression of Traders' duty of good faith in a first party relationship. Insurers are responsible for investigating new information provided by the insured after benefits are terminated, as part of their ongoing duty to insured persons. The mere fact that an insurer investigates new information does not invalidate the initial refusal to pay benefits.

<P>74. Adjudicator Ferguson found that the March 4, 2015 termination letter was ambiguous based on the premise that the letter left open the possibility that Ms. Rumball could make future applications for IRB by submitting a new OCF-3. This premise is fundamentally flawed, and constitutes a serious error of law. It is unreasonable. Ms. Rumball had no right to re-apply for IRB under the <EM>Schedule</EM>, nor would the provision of a new OCF-3 stop or reset the limitation clock. The limitation period under the <EM>Schedule</EM> is not a rolling one.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>The Termination Letter Did Not Request an Updated OCF-3</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>75. Traders did not request an additional OCF-3 from Ms. Rumball, nor did it state that additional IRB would be payable should she provide a fresh OCF-3. The letter very clearly states that <UNDER>if</UNDER> Ms. Rumball was to go off work again due to her accident related injuries, she was required to provide a new OCF-3 before Traders General would be in a position to consider any future request she might make to reinstate her IRB. Ms. Rumball's interpretation of this statement as a request for an OCF-3 that somehow suspended the limitation period defies logic, other than as an attempt by her lawyer to try and avoid an E&amp;O claim for missing the IRB limitation period.</P>
<P>76. The further irony is that despite this supposed &ldquo;invitation&rdquo; to have Traders reconsider her claim if she went off work again and submitted new documentation, there was no evidence before the Tribunal that Ms. Rumball ever did go back off work, or that she did submit a further OCF-3 until well after the two-year limitation had expired. Ms. Rumball only provided a second OCF-3 on October 26, 2017, some seven months after the expiry of the limitation period.</P>
<P>77. If Ms. Rumball had thought that Traders somehow left open to her the possibility of submitting a new OCF-3 to automatically re-start her IRB, then it stands to reason she would have submitted such an OCF-3 soon after a change in circumstance, such as a stoppage of work. Leaving aside the fact that this interpretation is an impermissible subjective analysis, Ms. Rumball took no such action.</P>
<P>78. Adjudicator Ferguson further compounds his error of law by indicating that the termination letter did not stipulate a two-year limitation period on the submission of a new OCF-3, thus the letter did not advise Ms. Rumball of a two-year limitation for future applications for IRB. There is no provision in the <EM>Schedule</EM> allowing an insured to make multiple applications for IRB, let alone providing for a limitation period to take such action. As a result, the central premise of the adjudicator's finding is based on a serious error of law.

<P>79. The Court of Appeal has held that there is no waiver where an insurer receives new evidence, yet clearly indicates that it has not changed positions on the refusal. The limitation period does not reset where the insured person attempts to re-apply for benefits or otherwise re-assert a claim for IRB, and the insurer refuses the request. It is well established that an insurer has a duty to assess new information provided by the insured person, which does not result in re-setting the limitations clock.

<P>80. That a new OCF-3 was not submitted by Ms. Rumball until October 2017, only <UNDER>after</UNDER> Traders pointed out the absence of any new OCF-3 at the case conference, seems to be of no concern to the adjudicator. Traders clearly and unequivocally reiterated that IRB was terminated on March 4, 2015, and that the limitation period had expired. There was no waiver of the limitation period by Traders in October 2017, only a reaffirmation of the March 4, 2015 termination of IRB. This situation is exactly on point with that discussed by the Court of Appeal in <EM>Haldenby</EM> and <EM>Blake</EM>, and is essentially a mirror-image of <EM>Bonaccorso</EM>. It was unreasonable for Adjudicator Ferguson to ignore these decisions.</P>
<P>81. The adjudicator's tortured analysis of the OCF-3 request found at paragraph 25 of the decision is clearly unreasonable.</P>
<P>82. This interpretation would have the effect of significantly undermining the legislature's intention to provide clarity and finality in limitation periods. Based on her argument, endorsed by Adjudicator Ferguson, Ms. Rumball would be subject to no limitation period, and can advance her claim in perpetuity. This is clearly an unreasonable outcome.</P>
<P>83. One single claim for IRB arises from an accident. Ms. Rumball applied for IRB with the submission of her OCF-3 and OCF-2. Traders paid the IRB, and refused to make any further IRB payments after February 25, 2015. There were no additional applications for IRB to be made, and the only recourse for Ms. Rumball was to dispute the termination of her IRB by March 4, 2015. She failed to do so, and her claim for IRB is time barred.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1: OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Traders General Insurance Company (&ldquo;Traders&rdquo;) appeals from the decision of Adjudicator Christopher Ferguson of the Licence Appeal Tribunal (the &ldquo;LAT&rdquo;) on a preliminary issue dated February 5, 2018 (the &ldquo;decision&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. The Adjudicator found that the Respondent, Shelley Rumball's, application for Income Replacement Benefits was not statute barred as Traders had not made a clear and unequivocal denial of the benefit when it stopped payments on March 4, 2015.</P>
<P>3. An appeal from the Licence Appeal Tribunal is <BOLD>available only on a question of law alone</BOLD>. The Divisional Court has already decided that the issue of <UNDER>whether a denial of a benefit by an insurer is clear and unequivocal is a question of mixed fact and law and that there is no appeal</UNDER> from the License Appeal Tribunal to the Divisional Court on this issue. For this reason alone, the appeal should be dismissed.</P>
<P>4. The Appellant is conflating two issues. The Appellant argues, quite properly, that the Court of Appeal has rejected the concept of a rolling limitation period in accident benefits cases. However, the <UNDER>limitation period is only triggered upon a clear and unequivocal denial</UNDER>. In this case the Adjudicator found that there was no clear and unequivocal denial so <UNDER>any analysis about a rolling limitation period is not relevant since a limitation period was not triggered</UNDER>.</P>
<P>5. Adjudicator Ferguson applied the correct test to the facts for determining whether the benefits had been clearly and unequivocally denied. Even if there was a right of appeal, the Adjudicator's decision was reasonable and falls within a range of possible accepted outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</P>
<P>6. This appeal does not deal with causation, quantum, or eligibility (which have not yet been decided) but only with the very narrow issue of whether the insurer's denial was clear and unequivocal.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART 2: STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</TI>
<P>7. Ms. Rumball was involved in a motor vehicle accident on December 28, 2014. She held a policy of insurance with Traders and applied to receive Statutory Accident Benefits from Traders. Statutory Accident Benefits are no-fault benefits that are available to insureds involved in a motor vehicle accident whether or not the insured was at fault for the accident.</P>
<P>8. Income Replacement Benefits are benefits available to insureds under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule to provide the insured with money when they are unable to work as a result of an accident. Ms. Rumball applied for and received Income Replacement Benefits from Traders from January 4, 2015 to February 24, 2015.</P>
<P>9. On March 4, 2015, Traders sent correspondence to Ms. Rumball which was neither clear nor unequivocal. Traders indicated that it was both paying and stopping Income Replacement Benefits. Traders paid Ms. Rumball $2,824.94 in Income Replacement Benefits, and stopped payments because she had since returned to work. <UNDER>The letter told Ms. Rumball that she was both eligible and no longer eligible for the benefit</UNDER>.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Letter dated March 4, 2015, attached at Tab 6 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. In its correspondence, Traders indicated:
<QUOTE><P>Should you be off work again due to the injuries sustained as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident, we would require an updated <EM>Disability Certificate</EM> (OCF-3) to determine your eligibility. Per Section 36(2)(3) of the SABS an applicant for a specified benefit shall submit a completed <EM>Disability Certificate</EM> (OCF-3) that indicates you meet the disability test. There is no entitlement to benefits for any period before the updated Disability Certificate is submitted.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: <EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. Ms. Rumball stopped working again on May 31, 2015. On July 17, 2017, Ms. Rumball submitted an Application by an Injured Person to the LAT to appeal the insurer's refusal to pay of past Income Replacement Benefits from May 31, 2015 onward.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: LAT Application, as attached at Tab 7 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. At a telephone Case Conference conducted on October 31, 2017, Traders requested a preliminary issue hearing as to whether Ms. Rumball was barred from pursuing Income Replacement Benefits due to a limitation period.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Case Conference Report dated October 31, 2018 as attached at Tab 8 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. The preliminary issue hearing was scheduled to be read on January 15, 2018 by an adjudicator.</P>
<P>14. Arbitrator Ferguson found that the appeal to the Licence Appeal Tribunal was not statute-barred. The March 4, 2015 letter to Ms. Rumball which the insurer argued was a denial that triggered a limitation period was not clear and unequivocal. Because the denial was not clear and unequivocal the letter did not start the limitation clock.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART 3: ISSUES</TI>
<P>15. The issues in this Appeal are:
<P1>a. Does the insurer have a right of appeal?</P1>
<P1>b. If the insurer has a right of appeal, what is the applicable standard of review?</P1>
<P1>c. If the insurer has a right of appeal, was the decision of Adjudicator Ferguson reasonable?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>There is no right of appeal</TI>
<P>16. Appeals from a decision of the LAT relating to a matter under the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> may only be on a question of law, pursuant to section 11(6) of the <EM>Licence Appeal Tribunal Act</EM>.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Licence Appeal Tribunal Act, S.O. 1999, c. 12, Sched. G at s. 11, attached at Schedule B.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. As recently as June 2018, the Divisional Court has held that <BOLD>the question of whether a denial was clear and unequivocal is a question of mixed fact and law and that, as a result, there is no right of appeal</BOLD> to the Divisional Court, stating:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Was the 2005 denial clear and unequivocal</EM>?</P>
<P>No appeal lies to this court on this issue. The appellant does not argue that the adjudicator applied an incorrect legal test. She argues that the adjudicator applied the test incorrectly on the facts as found. <BOLD>Whether, on the facts accepted by the tribunal, a particular denial of benefits meets the applicable legal standard is not a question of law.</BOLD> The question of whether the insurer's denial was sufficiently clear and unequivocal is one of fact or mixed fact and law.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Oliver v. Brant Mutual Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 3716</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para 17, attached as Tab 2 of the Book of Authorities of the Respondent.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The issue in the appeal is not, as the Appellant suggests, the standalone applicability of a limitation period, which may also be a question of mixed fact and law, but rather whether the denial was clear and unequivocal.</P>
<P>19. In <CASEREF><SOC>The Guarantee Company v Dong Do et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Divisional Court held that whether a notification letter constituted a refusal which triggered a limitation period <BOLD><UNDER>was not a question of law</UNDER></BOLD> as it did not deal with &ldquo;a conceptual interpretation of a limitation clause but a &lsquo;nuts-and- bolts&rsquo; interpretation question within a highly factual context relating to the nature and wording of the notifications relied on by the Guarantee Company as constituting a &lsquo;refusal of benefits&rsquo; and thus triggering the limitation period&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>The Guarantee Company v Dong Do et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 1891</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at paras. 28&ndash;32, attached as Tab 4 of the Book of Authorities of the Respondent.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The Appellant, at paragraph 42 of its factum concedes that the Adjudicator <BOLD><UNDER>correctly</UNDER></BOLD> defined &ldquo;unequivocal&rdquo; and &ldquo;denial&rdquo;. The Appellant then goes on to challenge how the Adjudicator applied those correctly defined terms. This exercise is not a proper one to go through on an appeal limited by statute to questions of law only.</P>
<P>21. Under Rule 18.2 of the LAT Rules of Practice, any party may request a reconsideration of the LAT decision:
<QUOTE><P>18.2. A request for reconsideration will not be granted unless the Executive Chair is satisfied that one or more of the following criteria are met:
<P1>(a) The Tribunal acted outside its jurisdiction or violated the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Tribunal made a significant error of law or fact such that the Tribunal would likely have reached a different decision;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Tribunal heard false or misleading evidence from a party or witness, which was discovered only after the hearing and would have affected the result; or</P1>
<P1>(d) There is new evidence that could not have reasonably been obtained earlier and would have affected the result</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Licence Appeal Tribunal (LAT) Rules of Practice and Procedure (April 1, 2016) at s. 18.2, attached at Schedule B.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The Appellant could have, but did not, seek a reconsideration hearing. In fact, the Appellant relies on a recent reconsideration decision of the LAT to set out that a refusal to pay benefits is not dependent on any specific wording. While it may have been open to the Appellant to make such an argument at a reconsideration hearing, it instead chose to appeal a question of mixed fact and law.</P>
<P>23. The Appellant also relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v. State Farm</SOC></CASEREF> for the principle that the applicability of a limitation period in accident benefits cases is a question of law but the Turner case <BOLD><UNDER>says nothing</UNDER></BOLD> about the applicability of a limitation period being a question of law. The legal test is whether the denial is &ldquo;clear and unequivocal&rdquo; but its application is a question of mixed fact and law. In any event, the right of appeal from the Director's Delegate at the Financial Services Commission of Ontario is not the same as the right of appeal from the LAT under the Licence Appeal Tribunal Act.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>If There is a Right of Appeal, The Standard of Review is Reasonableness</TI>
<P>24. As previously stated, appeals from a decision of the LAT relating to a matter under the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> may only be on a question of law, pursuant to section 11(6) of the <EM>Licence Appeal Act</EM>.</P>
<P>25. In <EM>Oliver</EM>, the Divisional Court cited with approval a previous Divisional Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>D.O. v. TD Insurance Meloche Monnex</SOC></CASEREF>:

<P>[9] In <CASEREF><SOC>Agyapong v. Jevco Insurance Company et al.</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 878</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII), Justice Wilton-Siegel described a reasonableness standard of review as follows:
<QUOTE><P>In determining whether a decision is reasonable, the court is concerned largely with the justification, transparency and intelligibility of the Board's reasons, as well as whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes, given the facts and law: see <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v.

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>If There is a Right of Appeal, The Adjudicator's Decision was Reasonable</TI>
<P>26. The Adjudicator's decision readily satisfies the requirements of justification, transparency and intelligibility and falls well within the range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible of the facts and law.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>47</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>attached as Tab 1 of the Book of Authorities of the Respondent.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Adjudicator Ferguson relies on <BOLD><UNDER>six</UNDER></BOLD> separate reasons that the March 4, 2015 letter was not a clear and unequivocal denial:</P>

<P1><BOLD>Reference: Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson dated February 5, 2018 at para. 25, attached at Tab 2 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. This is a finding of fact, and was open to the Adjudicator to consider when assessing Income Replacement Benefits. Furthermore, the Appellant has not raised any reason why this finding of fact would be an error. For this to be an error of law, there must be a complete absence of evidence for this finding to be made, as stated by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>State Farm v. SR</SOC></CASEREF>. However, this finding of fact is supported by the Appellant's own arguments.

<P>29. This finding of fact was agreed to by the insurer in their Preliminary Issue Submissions dated December 6, 2017:
<QUOTE><P>Finally, the Explanation of Benefits clearly advised Ms. Rumball that she would be required to submit an updated OCF-3 to make a further determination on IRB eligibility, should she subsequently go off work as a result of accident-related injuries.</P></QUOTE>

<P>30. This is a finding of fact, made by the Adjudicator. Furthermore, the Appellant has not raised any reason why this finding of fact would be an error.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii)</N><TI>Reason 3 of Adjudicator Ferguson</TI>
<P><QUOTE><P>iii. The letter's notice of a limitation period on the applicant's right to dispute its termination of IRBs was equivocal because it referred to &ldquo;<EM>this decision</EM>&rdquo; [emphasis mine]. I find that &ldquo;this decision&rdquo; could reasonably be interpreted to:
<P1>a. include the stipulation by the insurer that it would reconsider her IRBs upon submission of an updated OCF-3, and</P1>
<P1>b. exclude any future &ldquo;s.11 decision&rdquo; by the respondent made with respect to an updated OCF-3 and accompanying documents.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: <EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. This is a further finding of fact made by the Adjudicator, in accordance with the Applicant's submissions. The Appellant has not raised any issue of how this is an error and has not raised any contradicting evidence to refute this point.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iv)</N><TI>Reason 4 of Adjudicator Ferguson</TI>
<P><QUOTE><P>iv. The wording of the bold-typed paragraph on page three of the letter, warning of a two- year time limit for commencing arbitration (i.e. an appeal), does not reinforce the respondent's interpretation that it has set the limitation period running on future IRB claims.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: <EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. This is a further finding of fact made by the Adjudicator, in accordance with the Applicant's submissions. The Appellant has not raised any issue of how this is an error.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>v)</N><TI>Reason 5 of Adjudicator Ferguson</TI>
<P><QUOTE><P>v. As the result of my observations in subparagraphs i.&ndash;iv., I find that the letter could reasonably lead the applicant to believe that her options with respect to the IRBs were being kept open in case her circumstances changed&mdash;and not to believe that it had denied her eligibility for IRBs with finality.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: <EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. This is a further finding of fact made by the Adjudicator, in accordance with the Applicant's submissions. The Appellant has not raised any issue of how this is an error.</P>
<P>34. This finding of fact was also agreed to by the insurer in their Preliminary Issue Submissions dated December 6, 2017:
<QUOTE><P>Finally, the Explanation of Benefits clearly advised Ms. Rumball that she would be required to submit an updated OCF-3 to make a further determination on IRB eligibility, should she subsequently go off work as a result of accident-related injuries.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Preliminary Issue Submissions of the Insurer at para. 11, attached at Tab 11 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>vi)</N><TI>Reason 6</TI>
<P><QUOTE><P>vi. I am persuaded that the ambiguity I see in the denial notice should be interpreted in favor of the insured, applying the <EM>contra proferentum</EM> rule that laws purporting to be consumer protection should be interpreted generously in favour of consumers, a widely understood principle in consumer and insurance contract law, articulated in <EM>Balzer</EM> and confirmed by the Supreme Court in numerous cases, including <EM>Smith</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson dated February 5, 2018 at para. 25, attached at Tab 2 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. This is an issue of mixed fact and law as it deals with &ldquo;a nuts-and-bolts interpretation question within a highly factual context relating to the nature and wording of the notifications relied on by&rdquo; the insurer, as addressed by this Court in <EM>Dong Do</EM>.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>The Guarantee Company v Dong Do</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM> at para. 31, attached as Tab 4 of the Book of Authorities of the Respondent.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. The extensive submissions set out in the Appellant's factum about there being only one limitation period (as opposed to a rolling one) <BOLD><UNDER>only</UNDER></BOLD> applies once there has been a clear and unequivocal denial.</P>
<P>37. In paragraph 5 of their Factum, the Appellant claims that the adjudicator &ldquo;ignored the fact that Traders' termination letter clearly and unequivocally terminated Ms. Rumball's IRB&rdquo;. This ignores Adjudicator Ferguson's entire analysis, and his determination of the legal test of whether there was a clear and unequivocal denial. Adjudicator Ferguson did not &ldquo;ignore the fact&rdquo;. At paragraph 24 of his reasons, the Adjudicator acknowledged the Appellant's position, and then provided the reasons why he disagreed with the Appellant's position.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson dated February 5, 2018 at para. 24, attached at Tab 2 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. At paragraph 5, the Appellant claims that Adjudicator Ferguson's decision &ldquo;amounts to a determination that the limitations period in accident benefits cases is a rolling one.&rdquo; The Court of Appeal in the cases cited by the Appellant, <CASEREF><SOC>Haldenby v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Blake v. Dominion</SOC></CASEREF>, rejected the concept of a rolling limitation period <UNDER>where there has been a clear and unequivocal denial.</UNDER> In this case there has been no clear and unequivocal denial.</P>
<P>39. The Appellant has not provided any basis to challenge the Adjudicator's application of the law, other than to reiterate its previously rejected arguments and state that it disagrees with the Adjudicator's decision.</P>
<P>40. Again, this is not supported by Adjudicator Ferguson's reasons, wherein he actually explains what an &ldquo;unequivocal&rdquo; denial means:
<QUOTE><P>&ldquo;Unequivocal&rdquo; means &ldquo;clear, plain; capable of being understood in only one way, or as clearly demonstrated; free from uncertainty, or without doubt ...&rdquo; A denial notice must be &ldquo;in straightforward and clear language, directed towards an unsophisticated person.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Decision of Adjudicator Ferguson dated February 5, 2018 at para. 21, attached at Tab 2 of the Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. At paragraph 42 its factum, the Appellant agrees that the Adjudicator's definition of &ldquo;unequivocal&rdquo; is correct.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
