<BLOCK1><TI>THE PARTIES</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>THE PLAINTIFF</TI>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, Aviva Canada Inc. (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;), is an insurance company duly incorporated and licensed by the laws of Ontario to carry on business as an automobile insurer. Aviva's head office is located in the City of Markham, in the Province of Ontario.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>THE DEFENDANTS</TI>
<P>3. The Defendant, 1843538 Ontario Inc. is a duly incorporated company which carries on business, under the firm name and style of Mississauga Auto Collision Centre, and/or McLaren Collision (hereinafter known as &ldquo;McLaren&rdquo;), as an auto body shop located at 1095 Fewster Drive in Mississauga, Ontario.</P>
<P>4. The Defendant, Rony Amanuel Warda (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Rony Warda&rdquo;), resides in Milton and/or Mississauga and is the named owner of McLaren.</P>
<P>5. The Defendant, Fady Rony Warda (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Fady Warda&rdquo;), resides in Milton and was at all material times an employee of McLaren.</P>
<P>6. The Defendant, Michael Wetzel (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Michael Wetzel&rdquo;), resides in Markham and at all material times was employed as a Senior Auto Damage Appraiser by Aviva.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>THE NATURE OF THIS ACTION</TI>
<P>7. This action arises out of the Defendants' conspiracy to defraud Aviva through a series of fraudulent misrepresentations and unlawful actions in relation to repairs made to two motor vehicles, a 2010 Ford Fusion (hereinafter known as &ldquo;the Fusion&rdquo;) and a 2016 Chrysler 200 (hereinafter known as &ldquo;the Chrysler&rdquo;), owned by Aviva. The material events took place in May of 2017 and September/October of 2017 respectively.</P>
<P>8. In 2017 Aviva was studying the auto collision repair industry in the Greater Toronto Area. Aviva purchased the Fusion and the Chrysler and then damaged the vehicles in a controlled setting. The vehicles were then appraised by an independent appraiser and taken to McLaren to have the damages appraised and repaired in the normal course of an insurance claim.</P>
<P>9. The Fusion and the Chrysler were taken to McLaren in May of 2017 and September/October of 2017 respectively. They were each appraised by Michael Wetzel of Aviva after which time they were purportedly repaired. Upon completion of the repairs, the vehicles were appraised once again by an independent appraiser, at Aviva's request. Fraudulent misrepresentations were identified in the appraisal completed by Michael Wetzel. Fraudulent misrepresentations were also identified in the invoices submitted by McLaren and Rony Warda.</P>
<P>10. Furthermore, it became known that Fady Warda deliberately caused damage to the Fusion by striking it violently and repeatedly with an object with the intent to cause farther damage and inflate the repair costs. This deliberate act was carried out in the presence of, and with the knowledge of, Michael Wetzel.</P>
<P>11. It also became known that Rony Warda deliberately caused damage to the Chrysler by striking it violently and repeatedly with an object with the intent to cause further damage and inflate the repair costs. This deliberate act was carried out in the presence of, and with the knowledge of, Michael Wetzel.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>THE FRAUDULENT ACTS</TI>
<P>12. As described above, Aviva ascertained that there were fraudulent misrepresentations made in regards to the appraisals submitted by Michael Wetzel, as well as fraudulent misrepresentations made in the invoices submitted by McLaren and Rony Warda regarding the repairs completed to the vehicles in question.</P>
<P>13. In particular, it became clear to Aviva that, in regards to the appraisals completed by Michael Wetzel:
<P1>a. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts were included on the appraisal as being required to be replaced which in fact were not damaged and did not need to be replaced;</P1>
<P1>b. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts were included on the appraisal as requiring refinishing when in fact they were not damaged and did not require refinishing.</P1>
<P1>c. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts were listed on the appraisal to be replaced and/or refinished which had not initially been damaged prior to the vehicle being taken to McLaren, but were deliberately damaged by Fady Warda and Rony Warda, with the knowledge of all other Defendants.</P1></P>
<P>14. In regards to the purported repairs to the vehicles, Aviva became aware that:
<P1>a. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts on the vehicles were intentionally damaged by Fady Warda and Rony Warda and then repaired and invoiced;</P1>
<P1>b. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts were reported to have been replaced but were not replaced yet invoiced; and</P1>
<P1>c. to the knowledge of the Defendants, various parts were reported to have been repaired but were not repaired yet invoiced.</P1></P>
<P>15. An employment agreement existed between Aviva and Michael Wetzel whereby the said Defendant agreed to perform appraisal services for Aviva in accordance with Aviva's Code of Conduct. It was an express term of the Code of Conduct that Michael Wetzel would perform the appraisals honestly and not participate in any fraudulent activity with an auto body shop in relation to the appraisals completed.</P>
<P>16. Furthermore, each time an auto body shop, such as McLaren, agrees with an insurer, such as Aviva, to carry out repairs to an insured's vehicle, a contract is created in which the auto body shop agrees to perform the repairs completely and honestly and the insurer agrees to pay the appropriate price for the work. Such contracts existed in the case of the Fusion and the Chrysler.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>FRAUD &amp; FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION</TI>
<P>17. As particularized above, the Defendants together and in concert designed, orchestrated and implemented a scheme to defraud Aviva and thereby obtain monies from Aviva under false pretences.</P>
<P>18. The Defendants made false representations, knowingly, without belief in their truth, or recklessly, careless as to whether the representations were true or false. The Defendants intended that Aviva should act in reliance on the representations and Aviva has suffered damages as a result of such reliance.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>BREACH OF DUTY OF GOOD FAITH/BREACH OF DUTY OF HONEST PERFORMANCE</TI>
<P>19. The Defendants committed the tort of breach of duty of good faith in that they owed a duty to act honestly in the performance of contractual obligations and they failed to do so as described above.</P>
<P>20. The Defendants also failed to fulfil their duty of honest performance in contractual relations.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>CONSPIRACY</TI>
<P>21. The Defendants committed the tort of conspiracy in that:
<P1>a. the conduct of the Defendants was unlawful, planned and deliberate, was directed towards Aviva, and the Defendants knew, or should have known, in the circumstances that injury to Aviva was likely to, and did, result;</P1>
<P1>b. in the alternative, and in addition to (a.), the means planned, coordinated and agreed upon between and among the Defendants were both lawful and unlawful but the predominant purpose of the Defendants' conduct was to cause injury to Aviva and such injury did result.</P1></P>
<P>22. The Defendants agreed, or had a common intention, to pursue a course of action which has resulted in damage to Aviva. The Defendants committed overt acts referred to above in pursuance of their common design.</P>
<P>23. The acts and means by which the Defendants agreement was carried into effect were unlawful and were directed at Aviva. These acts included fraud and deceit resulting in the damages that Aviva has sustained.</P>
<P>24. Insofar as lawful means were used by the Defendants to achieve the object of the conspiracy, the Defendants intended to injure Aviva.</P>
<P>25. Aviva's damages are causally related to the acts taken pursuant to the agreement among the Defendants.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>UNJUST ENRICHMENT</TI>
<P>26. The Defendants received a benefit as a result of their fraudulent actions while Aviva suffered a loss in direct relation to the benefit gained by the Defendants. There was also no legally justified reason for the benefit sustained by the Defendants resulting in the loss suffered by Aviva.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>TRESPASS TO PROPERTY</TI>
<P>27. Fady Warda and Rony Warda committed the act of trespass to property in that they intentionally vandalised the Fusion and the Chrysler when they were not acting under a right or authority conferred by law to do so, and they did not have the express permission of Aviva to engage in such an activity, which was prohibited.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>PUNITIVE DAMAGES</TI>
<P>28. The conduct of the Defendants is such as to justify an award of punitive and/or exemplary damages. The Defendants have behaved with arrogance and high-handedness, have shown a callous disregard and complete lack of concern for Aviva's rights and ought to be punished and deterred from this sort of misconduct. The Defendants' conduct was sufficiently reprehensible so as to justify an award of punitive and/or exemplary damages from the Defendants. The Defendants were aware of the probable consequences of their conduct and the damage such conduct would cause Aviva.</P>
<P>29. The Defendants' conduct was high-handed, reckless, without cause, deliberate, and in disregard of Aviva. They knew or ought to have known that their actions and omissions would have a significant adverse effect on Aviva.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>PLACE OF TRIAL</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff proposes that this action be tried at the City of Toronto in the Province of Ontario.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM OF THE DEFENDANT (PLAINTIFF BY COUNTERCLAIM) MICHAEL WETZEL</TI>
<P>1. The defendant Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;) admits the allegations in paragraphs 6 and 15 of the statement of claim.</P>
<P>2. The defendant Wetzel denies the allegations contained in paragraphs 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28 and 29 of the statement of claim.</P>
<P>3. The defendant Wetzel has no knowledge in respect of the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5,16 and 27 of the statement of claim.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</TI>
<P>4. The plaintiff Aviva Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;), in a deeply misguided guest to curb and curtail what it perceived to be fraudulent practices amongst certain auto body shops within the Greater Toronto area, as aided and abetted by industry appraisers, <UNDER>by its own admission</UNDER> embarked on a scheme to stage fake car accidents in the hope that it could subsequently identify and punish these alleged fraudsters. However, in so doing, Aviva violated both federal criminal law and provincial insurance law. As such, the herein proceeding, by its very nature, is an abuse of the process of the Court and should, on account thereof, be summarily dismissed. In addition, Aviva also violated Wetzel's contractual employment rights by unilaterally and without any notice terminating his employment therewith on the purported &ldquo;for cause&rdquo; basis that Wetzel was an alleged co-conspirator in the alleged fraud, which termination effectively foreclosed any possibility that Wetzel can ever work again as an appraiser. These allegations as against Wetzel are specious and false. Accordingly, for the reasons to given herein, Wetzel pleads that the herein action as against himself be dismissed, with costs awarded in his favour on a substantial indemnity basis.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>5. On October 16, 2015, Aviva hired Wetzel, on a full-time employment basis, to be a Senior Auto Damage Appraiser in its Auto Appraisal department and reporting directly to the Senior Supervisor. Base pay was initially set at $64,000, with annual increases set at 2.5%. In addition, he was also to be given an annual bonus, a company car (with gas and car insurance paid), life insurance and other benefits.</P>
<P>6. In short order, Wetzel established himself to be a competent, diligent and loyal employee for Aviva, which performance he maintained throughout his two-year tenure with the company. In point of fact, in Aviva's own HR Advice Case Summary, dated November 7, 2017, Wetzel's term of employment was characterized as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Performance Over Time:</BOLD> Goals consistently achieved</P>
<P><BOLD>Performance Current:</BOLD> Goals consistently achieved</P></QUOTE>
(Bold in original.)</P>
<P>7. The defendant Wetzel pleads, and the fact is, that throughout his tenure with Aviva, at no time did Aviva raise any issues in regards to Wetzel either in regards to his competency as an appraiser or in regards to any ethical and/or criminal matters related to his employment. In fact, it was only on November 7, 2017 when Wetzel was first accused of unethical conduct by Aviva, who then proceeded to terminate his employment on that very date.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>AVIVA'S SCHEME TO STAGE FAKE ACCIDENTS</TI>
<P>8. In May of 2017, through its agents, Aviva staged an accident between a 2010 Ford Fusion SEL (&ldquo;Ford&rdquo;) and a 2012 Mazda 5 GS (&ldquo;Mazda&rdquo;). The scenario employed by Aviva unfolded as follows: (1) the Ford was <UNDER>deliberately</UNDER> damaged by Aviva agents; (2) the Ford, as damaged, was then appraised by Niagara Appraisal Services (Wally Clark (&ldquo;Clark&rdquo;)); (3) the two vehicles were then driven by private investigators hired by Aviva to a prearranged location, whereby the fake &ldquo;accident&rdquo; would occur; and (4) finally, a private towing company towed the Ford to the McLaren Collision Centre in Mississauga, Ontario.</P>
<P>9. Subsequently, in September of 2017, two vehicles were again involved in a staged accident. The same Mazda as before was utilized, together with a 2016 Chrysler 200 (&ldquo;Chrysler&rdquo;). As in the previous case, the same sequence of events unfolded: (1) the Chrysler was <UNDER>deliberately</UNDER> damaged by Aviva agents; (2) the Chrysler, as damaged, was then appraised by Clark; (3) private investigators hired by Aviva drove the vehicles to a prearranged location, whereupon the fake &ldquo;accident&rdquo; occurred; and (4) finally, a private towing company towed the Chrysler to the McLaren Collision Centre.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>AVIVA'S CLAIMED FRAUD AS AGAINST WETZEL</TI>
<P>10. In regards to Wetzel, Aviva has alleged that, in regards to both appraisals that he did, one for the Ford and one for the Chrysler, items were fraudulently included as requiring repair or replacement when in fact no such repairs or replacements were required. In particular, the following two charts (one for each of two vehicles appraised), as prepared by Aviva, set out these claimed discrepancies, including what was and wasn't allegedly done, and what Aviva ultimately claims were its &ldquo;unjustified charges&rdquo;:</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI>RESPONSE TO THE FRAUD ALLEGATIONS</TI>
<P>11. First, contrary to what has been alleged by the plaintiff Aviva, the defendant Wetzel pleads, and the fact is, that at no time did he ever conspire with any of the other defendants to defraud or otherwise harm the plaintiff in any way, shape or form.</P>
<P>12. Second, contrary to what has been alleged by the plaintiff Aviva, the defendant Wetzel pleads, and the fact is, that at no time did he ever witness or have any knowledge of any deliberate acts of damage done to the subject vehicles while they were being repaired at the McLaren Collision Centre.</P>
<P>13. Third, contrary to what has been alleged by the plaintiff Aviva, the defendant Wetzel pleads, and the fact is, that at no time did he ever receive any kind of monetary compensation, either in the form of a &ldquo;kickback&rdquo; or otherwise, from any of the other defendants. Rather, at all times, Wetzel's only monetary compensation for the two subject appraisals performed was his usual employment income from Aviva, and nothing else.</P>
<P>14. Fourth, it is important to note that the defendant Wetzel's scope of employment was limited solely to that of an appraiser. In particular, it was <UNDER>not</UNDER> within the scope of his employment duties as an appraiser to subsequently verify if the body shop actually performed the services that it had billed for. Thus, none of the foregoing discrepancies mentioned in the two charts between what was billed by the body shop and what was allegedly performed bears any relevance to the defendant Wetzel.</P>
<P>15. Finally, there are a number of fundamental defects in the way that Aviva conducted its appraisals of the subject vehicles which explain, either in whole or in part, the noted discrepancies between Wetzel's appraisals and Clark's appraisals. These defects are as follows:
<P1>(i) In neither of the Ford or the Chrysler vehicles did Aviva's appraiser perform a &ldquo;tear down&rdquo; of the vehicles prior to them being sent to the shop for repair. This defect is fundamental because it is only with the benefit of a such a &ldquo;tear down&rdquo;, where the interior of the vehicle can be examined, that the appraiser can fully understand the extent of any damage caused to the vehicle. In direct contrast to the Clark appraisals, Wetzel did have the benefit of full &ldquo;tear downs&rdquo; prior to the repairs, where he was able to properly ascertain the true extent of the damage done to the vehicles;</P1>
<P1>(ii) Clark, as Aviva's selected appraiser, failed to use a paint gauge before and after the vehicles were repaired. This is also fundamental because it is only through this technology that an appraiser can verify whether or not the vehicle has been painted over from its original painting;</P1>
<P1>(iii) Clark, as Aviva's selected appraiser, failed to take unibody measurements before and after the repairs. This is a fundamental error since it is only with such measurements that one can properly ascertain whether any deformation to the unibody of the vehicle has occurred. This failure alone is sufficient to negate the findings of Aviva's appraiser; and</P1>
<P1>(iv) Finally, Aviva's selected appraiser also failed to perform any alignment specifications before and after the repairs. This failure is also fatal to Aviva's claim of fraudulent discrepancies between Wetzel's and Clark's appraisals.</P1></P>
<P>16. As is clear from the foregoing, the noted discrepancies between the Clark appraisals and the Wetzel appraisals is merely a reflection of the different methodologies employed by the two men. In other words, had Clark, as Aviva's appraiser, properly conducted the foregoing tests, including the all-important unibody measurements, the noted discrepancies would likely disappear. In any event, what is clear and undeniable is that Aviva's noted discrepancies have nothing to do with any fraudulent intent on the part of the defendant Wetzel, but rather reflect a legitimate and honest difference of opinion arising from the different methodologies used.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>AVIVA'S VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAW</TI>
<P>17. By virtue of the fact that Aviva has admitted to staging fake car accidents, the focus of inquiry shifts to whether such actions, in and of themselves, violate federal criminal law. The defendant Wetzel pleads, and the fact is, that the answer to that question is unquestionably &ldquo;ye s&rdquo;.</P>
<P>18. In the case at bar, it is undeniable that Aviva has committed the criminal offence of mischief, which is defined as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>430.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>Every one commits mischief who wilfully
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>destroys or damages property;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property; or</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(d)</N><PARAP>obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC>
<SEC><N>429.</N><SSEC><N>(3)</N><SSECP>Where it is an offence to destroy or to damage anything,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>the fact that a person has a partial interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the fact that a person has a total interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage with intent to defraud.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. In the case at bar, and contrary to what has been alleged by the plaintiff Aviva, <UNDER>none</UNDER> of the damaged cars were owned by Aviva. Accordingly, the admitted fact that Aviva deliberately damaged the cars in question necessarily means that it has committed the criminal offence of mischief.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>AVIVA'S VIOLATIONS OF PROVINCIAL INSURANCE LAW</TI>
<P>20. Subsection 233(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended, reads as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>233.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>Where,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>an applicant for a contract,
<SPARA><N>(i)</N><SPARAP>gives false particulars of the described automobile to be insured to the prejudice of the insurer, or</SPARAP></SPARA>
<SPARA><N>(ii)</N><SPARAP>knowingly misrepresents or fails to disclose in the application any fact required to be stated therein;</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the insured contravenes a term of the contract or commits a fraud; or</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>the insured wilfully makes a false statement in respect of a claim under the contract,</PARAP></PARA>
a claim by the insured is invalid and the right of the insured to recover indemnity is forfeited.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. In the case at bar, both insureds, after the &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; in question had occurred, wilfully made false statements in respect of their claims to Aviva since they knew that no &ldquo;accident&rdquo; had in fact occurred and that the whole thing was staged. Accordingly, pursuant to subsections 233(1)(b) and (c) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, each insureds contract of insurance with Aviva was rendered &ldquo;invalid&rdquo;, and their right to recover indemnity from the insurer Aviva was &ldquo;forfeited.&rdquo; Accordingly, since Aviva paid insurance under &ldquo;forfeited&rdquo; contracts, it can &ldquo;recover&rdquo; its losses by claiming back as against the insureds themselves.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>AVIVA'S ACTION BARRED BY THE DOCTRINE OF <EM>EX TURPI CAUSA NON ORITUR ACTIO</EM></TI>
<P>22. In the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 4</CITE></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada (per Rothstein, J.) ruled as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[20] The question is, &ldquo;under what circumstances should the immoral or criminal conduct of a plaintiff bar the plaintiff from recovering damages to which he or she would otherwise be entitled&rdquo; (p. 169). The following principles and approach are established in <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC></CASEREF> and are applicable in the present case.</P>
<P>1. Application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine in the tort context invalidates otherwise valid and enforceable actions in tort (p. 169).</P>
<P>2. Therefore, its application must be based on a firm doctrinal foundation and be made subject to clear limits and should occur &ldquo;in very limited circumstances&rdquo; (p. 169).</P>
<P>3. The only justification for its application is the preservation of the integrity of the legal system. This concern is only in issue where a damage award in a civil suit would allow a person to profit from illegal or wrongful conduct or would permit evasion or rebate of a penalty prescribed by the criminal law (p. 169).
<QUOTE><P>It would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is particularly important in this context that we bear in mind that the law must aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which&mdash;contract, tort, the criminal law&mdash;must be in essential harmony. For the courts to punish conduct with the one hand while rewarding it with the other, would be to &ldquo;create an intolerable fissure in the law's conceptually seamless web&rdquo;: Weinrib, <EM>supra</EM>, at p. 42. We thus see that the concern, put at its most fundamental, is with the integrity of the legal system. [p. 176]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>4. The <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine generally does not preclude an award of damages in tort because such awards tend to compensate the plaintiff rather than amount to &ldquo;profit&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>Such damages accomplish nothing more than to put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in had the tort not occurred. . . . [A plaintiff should get] only the value of, or a substitute for, the injuries he or she has suffered by the fault of another. <UNDER>He or she gets nothing for or by reason of the fact he or she was</UNDER> <UNDER>engaged in illegal conduct.</UNDER> [pp. 176-77]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>5. The <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is a defence in a tort action. The plaintiff's illegal conduct does not give rise to a judicial discretion to negate or refuse to consider the duty of care which goes to the relationship between a plaintiff and a defendant. It is independent of that relationship. The defendant may have caused harm by acting wrongly or negligently, but the &ldquo;responsibility for this wrong is suspended only because concern for the integrity of the legal system trumps the concern that the defendant be responsible&rdquo; (pp. 181-82).</P>
<P>6. Treating the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine as a defence places the onus on the defendant to prove the illegal or immoral conduct that precludes the plaintiff's action. And as a defence, it allows for segregation between claims for personal injury and claims that would constitute profit from illegal or immoral conduct or the evasion of or a rebate of a penalty provided by the criminal law.</P></QUOTE>
(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, since all of the compensatory damages that are being claimed by the plaintiff were <UNDER>directly</UNDER> caused by the criminal and illegal mischief that it engaged in by deliberately damaging the vehicles in question, Aviva should &ldquo;get nothing&rdquo; in damages on account thereof. Thus, by its very nature, this action is indeed an abuse of the process of the Court, and should be summarily dismissed on account thereof.</P></BLOCK1>

<P>23. The plaintiff Aviva is in the business of selling insurance, including automobile insurance, to the general public throughout this province. No one questions that this company, like any other insurer, is free to investigate fraud throughout the auto body repair industry, including any fraud that arises in relation thereto from within its own ranks. However, this freedom to investigate and, if any fraud is indeed discovered, to prosecute such fraud in the civil context is premised on there being actual fraud out there directed as against itself. It does not, however, extend t o situations such as the one at bar whereby Aviva itself fabricated fake accidents in the hope of catching would -be fraudsters in the act. By so doing, Aviva committed the criminal offence of mischief by deliberately damaging vehicles that it did not own itself. Even assuming, in <EM>arguendo</EM>, that the defendant Wetzel did commit fraudulent conduct (which is of course denied), Aviva's claim as against him is foreclosed by the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>. Simply put, Aviva cannot profit from its own criminal wrongdoing. In any event, and as has been explained herein, the defendant Wetzel committed no fraud and breached no duty to Aviva, whether in contract, in tort, fiduciary, or otherwise, and thus cannot be held liable in any way to Aviva. Thus, the action as against himself must be dismissed, with costs in his favour on a substantial indemnity basis.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">COUNTERCLAIM</TI>
<P>24. The defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) Wetzel claims as against the plaintiff (defendant by counterclaim) Aviva as follows:
<P1>(i) Compensatory damages, including moral damages, together with all outstanding statutory severance, termination and vacation pay, collectively in the amount of $750,000, all arising out of Aviva's unlawful termination of Wetzel's contract of employment therewith;</P1>
<P1>(ii) Punitive damages in the amount of $250,000 on account of Aviva's breach of its duty of good faith conduct in the manner that it terminated its employment of Wetzel;</P1>
<P1>(iii) Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on the amounts claimed at the rates provided for in the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, as amended;</P1>
<P1>(iv) Cost of this counterclaim on a substantial indemnity basis;</P1>
<P1>(v) HST where applicable to those amounts awarded by this Court; and</P1>
<P1>(vi) Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Court deems just and appropriate.</P1></P>
<P>25. The defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) repeats, relies and incorporates herein all of the allegations made in paras. 1 to 23 (both inclusive) of his statement of defence.</P>
<P>26. Wetzel is a 59 year-old man whose career as an appraiser in the automobile industry has been destroyed on account of the false fraud allegations that have been leveled against him by Aviva. Accordingly, Wetzel seeks to collect on what would have been his future employment income from Aviva until his retirement at the age of 65.</P>
<P>27. The employment income that Wetzel has foregone from Aviva up to his retirement and of which he is seeking compensation (totaling $734,000, rounded to the nearest thousand), is calculated as follows:

<P>28. Though Wetzel has attempted to mitigate his damages by seeking alternate employment as an appraiser with other companies, the fact that he was dismissed by Aviva on the basis of an alleged fraud forecloses any possibility that he can be rehired. In particular, though Wetzel was able to secure an interview with another insurer (Desjardins), he was unable to secure any position therewith once this new insurer learned of Wetzel's termination. Wetzel is currently unemployed, and sustains himself through his savings and any net income generated from self-directed trading in the capital markets.</P>
<P>29. In addition to compensatory damages arising from lost future income, the plaintiff by counterclaim also seeks moral damages on account of the manner that he was dismissed. Put succinctly, at the time of termination, Wetzel was treated like a dangerous criminal by h is supervisors at Aviva, was publicly humiliated in the process, and was even escorted out of the premises as if he were somehow a danger to the company or its personnel. Accordingly, Wetzel seeks modest moral damages for the mental pain and suffering that he sustained in the manner that he was dismissed.</P>
<P>30. In addition to compensation damages, Wetzel also seeks punitive damages as against Aviva to punish this company for the callous disregard that it showed to his basic human dignity and self -worth at the time of termination. Aviva did not even afford Wetzel an opportunity to explain himself; rather, it concluded that Wetzel was a fraudster and brusquely treated him as such. Such conduct is unacceptable, and amply warrants an award of punitive damages so as to punish this kind of outrageous behaviour.</P>
<P>31. The defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) pleads that the counterclaim be tried immediately after the hearing of the main action, all in the City of Toronto. However, due to the complexity of the factual and legal issues arising from this proceeding, the jury trial requested by Aviva would be inappropriate, and thus calling for a bench trial only.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>1. A series of motions are being brought by each of the parties involved in this action. Aviva Canada Inc., (&ldquo;the Plaintiff&rdquo;) is moving to strike paragraphs from the Defendants' Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. The Plaintiff is seeking the following relief:
<P1>a. An Order, pursuant to Rules 21.01, 25.06 and 25.11 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, to strike paragraphs 4, 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Michael Wetzel Defendant's (&ldquo;Wetzel Defendant&rdquo;) Statement of Defence and Counterclaim;</P1>
<P1>b. An Order, pursuant to Rules 21.01 and 25.06 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, to strike paragraphs 6, 7, 14, 15 and 20 of the 1843538 Ontario Inc. c.o.b.

Alternatively, the Warda Defendants are moving pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(b) to strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or is an abuse of the Court's process.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Law and Analysis as Applied to the Case at Bar</EM></TI>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Rule 21.01</EM></TI>
<P>10. Rule 21.01(1)(b) allows for a pleading to be struck on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01 (1)(b).</P1></P>
<P>11. Rule 21.01 (2) stipulates that no evidence is admissible on a motion under 21.01 (1)(b).
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01 (2).</P1></P>
<P>12. The test that is applied to determine whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action or defence is the &ldquo;plain and obvious test.&rdquo; The moving party must show that it is plain, obvious and beyond doubt that the respondent could not succeed in the claim or defence.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>K. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>13. The power of the Court to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is a valuable housekeeping measure that is essential to effective and fair litigation. By properly exercising the power to strike, the Court can unclutter the proceeding and weed out the hopeless claims. This ensures that only those claims that have some chance of success go on to a trial.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>K. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>14. Eliminating defences that have no reasonable cause of defence promotes efficiency in the conduct of the litigation and correct results. This allows both the litigants, the judges and juries to focus their attention where it should be&mdash;on claims that have a reasonable chance of success.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>15. A motion to strike for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence proceeds on the basis that the facts pleaded are true, unless they are manifestly incapable of being proven. Additionally, no evidence is permissible on such a motion.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>16. Whether the evidence substantiates the pleaded facts, now or at some future date, is irrelevant to the motion to strike. The judge on the motion to strike cannot consider what evidence adduces in the future might or might not show. To require the judge to do so would be to gut the motion to strike of its logic and ultimately render it useless.

<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>Mischief and <EM>Ex Turpi Causa</EM> in the Wetzel Defendant's Pleadings</UNDER></TI>
<P>17. Paragraphs 4, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Wetzel pleadings all fail to disclose a reasonable cause of defence and should be struck.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion&mdash;Aviva Canada Inc.'s Statement of Claim dated April 23, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>18. Paragraphs 4, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 22 and 23 reference federal criminal law and the legal doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> to form a cause of defence. Specifically, the <EM>Wetzel</EM> defendant is alleging that the Plaintiff committed the criminal offence of mischief.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion&mdash;Wetzel Defendant's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1></P>
<P>19. The criminal offence of Mischief is defined in Section 430 of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM>. Section 430 states that (1) every one commits mischief who wilfully: (a) destroys or damages property; (b) renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective; (c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property; or (d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 430 (1).</P1></P>
<P>20. Section 429 (3) of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM> considers the effect of having an interest in property that is destroyed or damaged. Specifically, the section stipulates that: (a) the fact that a person has a partial interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage; and (b) the fact that a person has total interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage with the intent to defraud.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 429 (3).</P1></P>
<P>21. The Wetzel Defendant alleges that by committing the criminal offence of mischief, the plaintiff should be barred in tort by the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>. The seminal Supreme Court of Canada decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC></CASEREF> considered the use of the doctrine in tort.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Wetzel Defendant's Statement of Defence and <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>[1993] S.C.J. No. 51</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>22. The application of the <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> principle in both Canada and elsewhere has a chequered history.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>[1993] S.C.J. No. 51</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>23. In <EM>Hall</EM>, Justice McLachlin, conducted a thorough examination of the cases where it was generally conceded that the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> may properly apply to tort actions. The goal of this thorough examination was to distill whether there was a unifying concern or theme that could serve to justify the application of the doctrine in tort.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>[1993] S.C.J. No. 51</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>24. One situation where the doctrine was said to have a clear role is the case where to allow the plaintiff's tort claim would be to permit the plaintiff to profit from their wrong. Profit in these scenarios is meant in the narrow sense of a <BOLD><UNDER>direct</UNDER></BOLD> pecuniary reward for an act of wrongdoing (emphasis added). Compensation for something other than wrongdoing, such as for personal injury, would not amount to profit in this sense.

<P>25. In <EM>Hall</EM>, Justice McLachlin ultimately concluded that there is a need in the law of tort for a principle which permits judges to deny recovery to a plaintiff on the ground that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system. This power was viewed as a limited power. Its use is justified where allowing the plaintiff's claim would introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law, either by permitting the plaintiff to profit from an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade a penalty prescribed by criminal law.

<P>26. In the Supreme Court of Canada's decision of <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Rothstein revisited and summarized <EM>Hall</EM> into six (6) principles to follow. The first (1) principle is an understanding that an application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine in the tort context invalidates otherwise valid and enforceable actions in tort. The second (2) principle attempts to recognize the grave consequences of applying the doctrine and cautions that it should only be used &ldquo;in very limited circumstances.&rdquo; The third (3) principle states that the only justification for the application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is the preservation of the integrity of the legal system. The fourth (4) principle states that the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine generally does not preclude an award of damages in tort because such awards tend to compensate the plaintiff rather than amount to profit. Finally, principles five (5) and six (6), states that the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is a defence in a tort action; as a defence, the onus is on the defendant to prove the illegal or immoral conduct that precludes the plaintiff's action.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>27. In <EM>Hall</EM>, the illegal conduct involved a drinking and driving incident that resulted in a vehicle rollover and significant head injuries. The driver had consumed 11 or 12 bottles of beer before taking the wheel. In <EM>Hall</EM> it was decided that the plaintiff need not be denied recovery as the compensation sought was for his injuries. Justice McLachlin stated that this could be reduced to the extent of the appellants contributory negligence, but cannot be wholly denied by reason of his disreputable or criminal conduct.
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>[1993] S.C.J. No. 51</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>28. In <EM>Zastowny</EM>, the plaintiff had been previously assaulted by an officer at a correctional centre. A psychologist later opined that the plaintiffs subsequent criminality resulted from the assaults. The plaintiff claimed for wage loss while incarcerated. His argument was that the reason he was incarcerated then for crimes committed, was due to the prior sexual assaults. The Court decided to apply the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi</EM> to bar damages for wage loss due to time spent in incarceration. Allowing these damages would introduce an inconsistency in the fabric of the law that compromised the integrity of the justice system. The Court reasoned that Zastowny was asking to be indemnified for the consequences of the commission of crimes for which he was found criminally responsible (and for which the prior sexual abuse did not provide a defence).

<P>29. Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Wetzel Statement of Defence and Counterclaim allege a violation of Section 233 (1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. Section 233 (1) covers misrepresentations or violations of conditions which renders insurance claims invalid. Specifically, Section 233 states:

<P>30. Section 233 (1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> is designed to protect Insurers from fraudulent claims against them. It is an avenue available to the insurer to argue a valid denial of coverage and on its face provides no remedy to anyone else. It does not create a crime or an offence of any kind, but simply provides a remedy to insurers in certain circumstances.

<P>31. It is plain and obvious that the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi</EM> does not apply to the case at hand. No law works to prevent a party from being able to damage and repair their own property. As such, it is plain and obvious that paragraphs 4, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 22 and 23 do not disclose a reasonable cause of defence and therefore must be struck. There is no reasonable chance of success for the defence of mischief and the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>.</P>
<P>32. It is plain and obvious that the Defendant incorrectly relied on Section 233 (1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. The defence that the insurer effectively and knowingly committed fraud against itself has no reasonable chance of success and therefore must be struck.</P></BLOCK6>

<P>34. The Supreme Court of Canada defined the doctrine of entrapment in its decision <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Mack</SOC></CASEREF>. The court recognized entrapment when: (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to persons to commit an offence without reasonable suspicion or acting mala fides; or (b) having a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they [the authorities] go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.

<P>Motion Returnable March 28, 2018</P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>OVERVIEW</UNDER>:</TI>
<P>1. In the underlying proceeding, the Plaintiff (the &ldquo;Moving Party&rdquo;), an insurance company, devised and implemented investigative projects based on its suspicion of abuse within the automotive repair industry, simulated (&ldquo;staged&rdquo;) two motor vehicle accidents, conducted surreptitious video surveillance on unknowing private employees of an auto repair business (the &ldquo;Responding Parties&rdquo;), and commenced an action against the Responding Parties, alleging they committed fraudulent acts, conspiracy and trespass to property in the course of motor vehicle body repairs conducted at the site of McLaren Collision in Mississauga, Ontario.</P>
<P>2. The Moving Party seeks special damages from each of the Responding Parties for the torts specified in its Statement of Claim in the amount of $10,017.86, in addition to $100,000 in punitive damages and $200,000 for its &ldquo;investigative costs,&rdquo; all of which relate to the simulated collisions.</P>
<P>3. The Moving Party seeks an Order striking paragraphs 6, 7, 14, 15 and 20 of these Responding Parties' Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>SUMMARY OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Parties</TI>
<P>4. The Plaintiff (Respondent), Aviva Canada Inc. (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;), is an insurance company duly incorporated and licensed by the laws of the Province of Ontario to carry on business as an automobile insurer.</P>
<P>5. The Defendant Michael Wetzel, (hereinafter known as &ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;), at all material times, was employed as a Senior Auto Damage Appraiser by Aviva. Wetzel counterclaimed against Aviva for amounts owing based on allegations including wrongful dismissal. Wetzel was not included in Aviva's plan to conduct &ldquo;controlled collisions.&rdquo;</P>
<P>6. The Defendant, 1843538 Ontario Inc., is a duly incorporated company which carries on business, under the firm name and style of McLaren Auto Collision (hereinafter known as &ldquo;MAC&rdquo;), is an auto body shop located at 1095 Fewster Drive in Mississauga, Ontario.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Statement of Claim</TI>
<P>7. For the purpose of this motion only, the facts contained herein reflect those pleaded in the Statement of Claim, and are assumed to be true.</P>
<P>8. In its Statement of Claim issued April 22, 2018, at paragraph 8, Aviva pleads that:
<QUOTE><P>In 2017 Aviva was studying the auto collision repair industry in the Greater Toronto Area. Aviva purchased the Fusion and the Chrysler and then damaged the vehicles in a controlled setting. The vehicles were then appraised by an independent appraiser and taken to McLaren to have the damages appraised and repaired in the normal course of an insurance claim.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Motion Record, Exhibit A, Statement of Claim, para. 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. Paragraph 8 is the offending allegation within the Moving Parties' Statement of Claim, which, these Responding parties submit, renders the whole claim subject to being struck.</P>
<P>10. Rather than compile, analyze and opine on any data or statistics deriving from actual motorist claims for property damage in the course of its &ldquo;study,&rdquo; Aviva purchased vehicles itself, placed policies of insurance under the corporate entity it created, staged collisions between the vehicles, and placed fictitious claimants in the vehicles without disclosing the foregoing to the eventual automotive repair facilities the vehicles were taken. The scheme unfolded contrary to &ldquo;the normal course of an insurance claim.&rdquo;</P>
<P>11. In truth, in or about May, 2017, through to October, 2017, at Aviva's initiative, Aviva carried out two investigative &ldquo;projects&rdquo; designed to entrap and punish alleged perpetrators of fraud allegedly occurring within the auto body repair industry.</P>
<P>12. The projects, reduced to their essential features, involved the following:
<P1>a) Aviva purchased two motor vehicles with the intent to damage them;</P1>
<P1>b) Aviva would deliberately cause an accident involving the two motor vehicles (or &ldquo;stage&rdquo; an accident), damaging each motor vehicle;</P1>
<P1>c) Aviva would use the appraisal of an independent appraiser to assess the resulting damage;</P1>
<P1>d) The fictional owners of the vehicles would then report the &ldquo;accident&rdquo; to tow vehicle drivers after being driven to a roadside location;</P1>
<P1>e) The vehicles would be taken to an auto body repair shop (McLaren Collision Centre), where an appraiser employed by Aviva (the co-defendant Wetzel) himself assessed the vehicles and directed McLaren staff to conduct repairs accordingly; and</P1>
<P1>f) Upon release of the vehicles to the fictitious owners, independent forensic engineers hired by Aviva were tasked to determine and report on the validity of the repairs.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>STATEMENT OF ISSUES, LAW AND AUTHORITY</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Determination of Questions of Law under Rule 21.01</EM></TI>
<P>13. The Responding Parties submit that, despite the Moving Party's request that paragraphs 6 and 15 of the &ldquo;Warda Defendants'&rdquo; Statement of Claim be struck, no reason is provided by the Moving Party and indeed, no argument is directed at those paragraphs in either its Factum or Motion Record. These Responding Parties are therefore unable to identify the concerns raised by the Moving Party in relation to paragraphs 6 and 15.</P>
<P>14. These Responding Parties submit that where novel legal developments arise, the law must remain dynamic and flexible. Authority for this proposition is provided by The Right Honourable Madame Justice McLachlin (as she then was), who deliberated in <CASEREF><SOC>Knight v.

The history of our law reveals that often new developments in the law first surface on motions to strike or similar preliminary motions, like the one at issue in <CASEREF><SOC>McAlister (Donoghue) v.

<P>Therefore, on a motion to strike, it is not determinative that the law has not yet recognized the particular claim. The court must rather ask whether, assuming the facts pleaded are true, there is a reasonable prospect that the claim will succeed. The approach must be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.</P></QUOTE>

<P>15. These Responding Parties submit that the inverse holds true with respect to the applicability of defences not conventionally raised in the context of civil claims, where novel claims are advanced and equally novel defences ought to be permitted.</P>
<P>16. These Responding Parties submit that the defence of entrapment is nowhere referenced at paragraph 20 of these Defendants' Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. Instead, the allegation contained at paragraph 20 falls more squarely within the pleading of negligent investigation than any element of entrapment.</P>
<P>17. These Responding Parties further submit that, at no time do the Responding Parties plead the specific defence of &ldquo;Entrapment&rdquo; as it is conventionally used in the criminal law context. At paragraphs 7 of the Warda's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, these Defendants use the phrase &ldquo;designs of entrapping&rdquo;, referring to the nature of the Plaintiff's planned project and its consequences. These Responding Parties remind this Honourable Court that despite the Plaintiff's plan to place controls on its scheme, it did not control for the actions of its own appraiser, who is a co-defendant in this same action. Emphasis ought to be placed on the word &ldquo;designs&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;entrap,&rdquo; in the sense that a conspiracy to ensnare any of a number of subjects in the Plaintiff's &ldquo;study&rdquo; occurred.</P>
<P>18. These Responding Parties further submit that in paragraph 14 of their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, the word &ldquo;entrapment&rdquo; is used to provide context of a result that might have occurred, should the Court agree with the description of the nature of the Plaintiff's scheme as criminal activity. The true pleading at paragraph 14 is the defence of <EM>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</EM>.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>THE NOVEL NATURE OF THE PLAINTIFF'S ACTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. Historically, projects of the kind created by the Plaintiff have unfolded according to concerns of wrongdoing, and in concert with police activity. One example these Responding Parties can point to is Project Whiplash, which was a joint project among the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the Toronto Police Service and a number of insurance companies. Of note, the concerns of wrongdoing arose through the investigation of earlier claims submitted by third party drivers.

<P>20. These Responding Parties respectfully submit that, should the Court ultimately allow the Plaintiff's action to proceed, these Responding Parties ought not be constrained from advancing defences normally applicable in the criminal law context, and have their actions adjudged by members of the community. The defences of entrapment, necessity and duress, by their very nature, address a range of exculpability on the part of defendants in the criminal sphere, identical to the projects designed by the Plaintiff in this civil action. The defence of entrapment ought to be permitted especially in these circumstances, in which the Plaintiff is seeking to conduct the trial by jury.

<BLOCK0><TI>RESPONDING FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANT (PLAINTIFF BY COUNTERCLAIM) MICHAEL WETZEL</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiff (defendant by counterclaim) Aviva Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;) has brought forth a motion, pursuant to rules 21.01, 25.06 and 25.11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;), seeking an order striking and/or dismissing various paragraphs of the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim of the defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;). Similar relief under the same Rules is also being sought by Aviva as against the other named defendants (the &ldquo;Warda Defendants&rdquo;). In response to this motion, both Wetzel and the Warda Defendants have brought forth their own Rule 21 motions, wherein they seek to dismiss Aviva's action in its entirety as a matter of law. In addition, Wetzel is also seeking summary dismissal of Aviva's claim pursuant to Rule 20 of the Rules; thus, for the purposes of that motion, evidence has been produced and will be relied upon. Accordingly, proceeding on March 28, 2019 before the same Judge is a triumvirate of motions, one brought by each set of parties.</P>
<P>2. The issues raised by Aviva in its moving factum, especially in regards to the law regarding (i) <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, (ii) fraud under the Ontario <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, and (iii) criminal mischief under the <EM>Criminal Code</EM> have already been extensively addressed in the Factum of the Defendant (Plaintiff by Counterclaim) Michael Wetzel, dated March 19, 2019 (&ldquo;Wetzel's Moving Factum&rdquo;). Accordingly, not only will Wetzel's Moving Factum be utilized in support of the relief that he seeks in his motion, but will also be utilized in response to Aviva's motion. Thus, the factual background and legal analysis stated therein will not be repeated again other than to state that such background and analysis are incorporated herein by reference, and will be fully relied upon at the motion hearing in response to Aviva's motion.</P>
<P>3. This responding factum, however, has been prepared specifically to address the few discrete issues raised in Aviva's factum which were not in issue in Wetzel's Moving Factum. These issues, and their analysis, now follow.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;AVIVA'S RULE 21 ARGUMENTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI><EM>Ex Turpi Causa</EM></TI>
<P>4. At para. 31 of Aviva's factum, the following was stated therein:
<QUOTE><P>31. It is plain and obvious that the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> does not apply to the case at hand. <UNDER>No law works to prevent a party from being able to damage and repair their own property</UNDER>. As such, it is plain and obvious that paragraphs 4, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 22 and 23 do not disclose a reasonable cause of defence and therefore must be struck. There is no reasonable chance of success for the defence of mischief and the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
(Emphasis added.)</P>
<P>5. However, there is a fundamental flaw with the foregoing analysis: On a Rule 21 motion, which is what Aviva is moving under, the facts as disclosed in Wetzel's pleadings <UNDER>must</UNDER> be assumed as true. This statement of law is well-settled, and was recently enunciated in <CASEREF><SOC>Rebello v. The Bank of Nova Scotia</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 7127</CITE></CASEREF> (per F.L. Myers, J.) as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[5] I approach the motion to determine if the fresh as amended statement of claim sets out recognized causes of action or a series of factual allegations that, if proven, would entitle the plaintiff to a legal remedy. The rules guiding this exercise are not in doubt. First, with few exceptions, <UNDER>I am required to assume that all of the facts alleged in the plaintiff's fresh as amended statement of claim are true</UNDER>. The issue is not whether the plaintiff can prove the things she alleges. Proof comes later. At this stage, the issue is just whether the plaintiff has alleged a coherent set of facts that can possibly provide her with a basis for obtaining judgment against the defendant under the applicable law. Second, I am required to read the statement of claim generously. That is, I am not trying to end the lawsuit just because lawyers can read the words used in a statement of claim in a narrow or technical sense that might not support a case. Third, I am not to dismiss the claim if it raises a very difficult or novel issue of law. If, however, assuming the facts to be true and reading the claims generously, it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot win the lawsuit, then I must dismiss the case now and save everyone the expense and trouble of dealing with it further for no reason. <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 42 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>1990 CanLII 90</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></QUOTE>
(Emphasis added.)</P>
<P>6. At paras. 19 of Wetzel's pleadings, the following was stated:
<QUOTE><P>19. In the case at bar, and contrary to what has been alleged by the plaintiff Aviva, <UNDER>none of the damaged cars were owned by Aviva</UNDER>. Accordingly, the admitted fact that Aviva deliberately damaged the cars in question necessarily means that it has committed the criminal offence of mischief.</P></QUOTE>
(Emphasis added.)</P>
<P>7. Accordingly, pursuant to settled law that, for the purposes of a Rule 21 motion, the impugned pleadings are &ldquo;assumed to be true&rdquo;, it necessarily follows that Aviva's argument in this regard must fail. Aviva did not damage its own property; rather, as pled, it deliberately damaged someone else's property, and thus <EM>prima facie</EM> committed criminal mischief.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><EM>Insurance Fraud</EM></TI>
<P>8. At para. 32 of Aviva's factum, the following was stated therein:
<QUOTE><P>32. It is plain and obvious that the Defendant [i.e., Wetzel] incorrectly relied on Section 233(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. <UNDER>The defence that the insurer effectively and knowingly committed fraud against itself</UNDER> has no reasonable chance of success and therefore must be struck.</P></QUOTE>
(Emphasis added.)</P>
<P>9. Once again, Aviva makes the fundamental mistake of disregarding what actually has been pled by Wetzel. In particular, para. 21 of Wetzel's pleadings stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P>21. In the case at bar, both insureds, after the &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; in question had occurred, wilfully made false statements in respect of their claims to Aviva since they knew that no &ldquo;accident&rdquo; had in fact occurred and that the whole thing was staged. Accordingly, pursuant to subsections 233(l)(b) and (c) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, each insureds contract of insurance with Aviva was rendered &ldquo;invalid&rdquo;, and their right to recover indemnity from the insurer Aviva was &ldquo;forfeited&rdquo;. Accordingly, since Aviva paid insurance under &ldquo;forfeited&rdquo; contracts, it can &ldquo;recover&rdquo; its losses by claiming back as the against the insureds themselves.</P></QUOTE>
Accordingly, as pled by Wetzel, this is <UNDER>not</UNDER> a case of fraud by Aviva as against itself; rather, this is a case of fraud committed by the insureds as against their insurer, which happened in this case to be Aviva. Thus, Aviva's second (and last) Rule 21 issue similarly fails.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;AVIVA'S RULE 25 ARGUMENTS</TI>
<P>10. Rule 25 of the Rules is simply a pleadings motion. The law in regards thereto was succinctly summarized in <CASEREF><SOC>Medad v. Steinberg</SOC><CITE>2019 ONSC 1480</CITE></CASEREF> (per Master P.T. Sugunasiri) as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[3] <BOLD><UNDER>Law and Analysis:</UNDER></BOLD></P>
<P>[4] The rules of pleadings are set out in Rule 25 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (&ldquo;Rules&rdquo;). Pleadings in an action can include a statement of claim, statement of defence, counterclaim and reply. Rule 25.06 applies to all pleadings. Rule 25.07 governs defences. Rule 25.08 refers to replies. Rule 25.11 gives the court discretion to strike pleadings if they are frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process. All of these sub-rules apply to the issue to be resolved in the within motion, namely if portions of Medad's Reply and Defence to CC ought to be struck. I set out the relevant portions of the rules below:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>25.6</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><TI><EM>Material Facts</EM></TI><SSECP>Every pleading shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the party relies for the claim or defence, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><TI><EM>Pleading Law</EM></TI><SSECP>A party may raise any point of law in a pleading, but conclusions of law may be pleaded only if the material facts supporting them are pleaded.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC>
<SEC><N>25.7</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In a defence, a party shall admit every allegation of fact in the opposite party's pleading that the party does not dispute.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><TI>Denials in a Defence</TI><SSECP>Subject to subrule (6), all allegations of fact that are not denied in a party's defence shall be deemed to be admitted unless the party pleads having no knowledge in respect of the fact.</SSECP></SSEC>

<SSEC><N>(3)</N><TI><EM>Reply Only Where Required</EM></TI><SSECP>A party shall not deliver a reply except where required to do so by subrule (1) or (2).</SSECP></SSEC>

<SEC><N>25.11</N><TI><EM>Pleadings is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious</EM></TI><SECP>The court may strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document,

<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>is an abuse of the process of the court.</PARAP></PARA></SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>[5] In addition to the application of these rules in determining the propriety of pleadings, a court should be mindful of the following general principles:
<P1>a. Pleadings that are irrelevant, argumentative or inserted for colour, or that constitute bare unfounded allegations should be struck out as scandalous;</P1>
<P1>b. A material fact is a fact that is necessary for a complete cause of action and a fact that can have an effect on the determination of a party's rights;</P1>
<P1>c. A pleading that raises an issue that can have no effect upon the outcome of the action is embarrassing and may be struck out;</P1>
<P1>d. A pleading should not describe the evidence that will prove a material fact. What this prohibition is designed to do is restrain the pleading of facts that are subordinate and that merely tend to prove the truth of the substantial facts in issue;</P1>
<P1>e. The distinction between material facts, particulars, and evidence is not a &ldquo;bright line&rdquo;. There will be situations where the minimum level of fact disclosure may require a pleading of material facts that might also be regarded as evidence.</P1>
<P1>f. A pleading cannot be scandalous if it is relevant;</P1>
<P1>g. A defendant is entitled to plead whatever material facts it chooses in response to the plaintiff's allegations, provided the facts alleged by the defence are relevant and at least of marginal probative value that is not outweighed by their prejudicial effect. It is not for the court the prune the case at the pleadings stage and limit allegations to what the court considers is a reasonable defence;</P1>
<P1>h. While pleadings must not offend the Rules, it is well established that counsel may frame their pleadings as they deem advisable and this right should not be lightly infringed by the court. The inclusion of unnecessary detail or excessive verbosity in a pleading is not of itself a reason for striking out a pleading. It is incumbent upon the party seeking to strike out pleadings to show that he or she is prejudiced or embarrassed by the pleading or that a fair trial will be delayed by the irregularity; and</P1>
<P1>i. If a part of a pleading is struck out because it is pleading evidence, then that would not preclude the admissibility of the evidence as proof of the plaintiff's cause of action.9 I would add that such admissibility is subject to any privileges or other evidentiary exclusions that the trier of fact applies. I would also add that striking a pleadings as evidence does not preclude an exploration of that evidence at discovery.</P1></P></QUOTE>
(Internal citations omitted.)</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Pleading Law</TI>
<P>11. At para. 40 of Aviva's factum, the following was stated:
<QUOTE><P>40. Paragraphs 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 plead conclusions of law absent the material facts required to support the conclusions. As such, these paragraphs violate Rule 25.06(2) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> and must be struck.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. This statement, of course, is demonstrably false. The factual underpinnings of the federal statutory offence of criminal mischief, the common law doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, and violations under the Ontario <EM>Insurance Act</EM> have all been <UNDER>fully</UNDER> set out in Wetzel's pleadings. Aviva's problem, however, lies in its mistaken belief that the vehicles that were deliberately damaged were its own; as pled, they clearly were not. Accordingly, Aviva's argument here must also fail.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><EM>Pleading Evidence</EM></TI>
<P>13. At para. 39 of Aviva's factum, Aviva alleged that Wetzel &ldquo;introduces evidence in paragraph 10&rdquo; and, as a result thereof, should be struck as being contrary to rule 25.06(1) of the Rules. Aviva misunderstands the law. As stated in <EM>Medad</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, &ldquo;[t]he distinction between material facts, particulars, and evidence is not a &ldquo;bright line&rdquo;. There will be situations where the minimum level of fact disclosure may require a pleading of material facts that might also be regarded as evidence.&rdquo; At para. 10, Wetzel listed what Aviva claims were the items that it was allegedly overcharged for. This is highly relevant to Wetzel's case in that it (i) demonstrates where Wetzel's appraisal coincides with Aviva's appraisal; (ii) demonstrates where (and how) they differ; and (iii) demonstrates discrepancies between the two appraisals and the work actually done (as determined by Aviva). These are all highly relevant and material facts that directly go to the merits of the case. Accordingly, there is no violation of any pleadings rule.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><EM>Pleadings &ldquo;Scandalous&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prejudicial&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P>14. At para. 45 of Aviva's factum, Aviva takes issue with para. 4 of Wetzel's pleadings on account of his description of Aviva's actions as being a &ldquo;deeply misguided quest&rdquo;. Aviva continues by stating that Wetzel's &ldquo;attempts to frame the Defendants accusations of illegality as something that has been admitted by the Plaintiff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;[t]he only possible purpose for including this in his Statement of Defence and Counterclaim is to cast the plaintiff in a bad light.&rdquo; Once again, Aviva misunderstands the law. Again as summarized in <EM>Medad</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, &ldquo;A pleading <UNDER>cannot</UNDER> be scandalous if it is relevant.&rdquo; (Emphasis added.) Though Aviva may not want to acknowledge the truth of the matter, it has readily conceded that the vehicles in question were deliberately damaged by itself. As pled by Wetzel, these vehicles were not owned by Aviva. Accordingly, Aviva has admitted to all of the constituent elements of criminal mischief. This is clearly relevant and thus not scandalous.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>15. Aviva has brought forth a pleadings motion in the hope of short-circuiting the crux of Wetzel's defence. Needless to say, this motion should be dismissed in its entirety. The fundamental flaw permeating Aviva's motion is its failure to recognize what actually has been pled by Wetzel. In particular, since Wetzel has clearly pled that the vehicles in question were <UNDER>not</UNDER> owned by Aviva, Aviva is in no position to argue against this factual statement in its Rule 21 motion. Accordingly, both issues that it raises under Rule 21, since they suffer from the same defect, must fail. With regards to its Rule 25 pleadings motion, Aviva misconstrues the law. Though Aviva may subjectively view Wetzel's pleadings as being &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; and &ldquo;prejudicial&rdquo; as against itself, nonetheless these pleadings are clearly relevant to the issues at bar and thus clearly admissible. Accordingly, Aviva's Rule 25 pleadings motion must also fail.</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANT (PLAINTIFF BY COUNTERCLAIM) MICHAEL WETZEL</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;) brings forth this motion seeking an order, pursuant to rule 20.01(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;), dismissing, either in whole or in part, the Statement of Claim of the plaintiff (defendant by counterclaim) Aviva Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;) as it relates specifically to himself. Additionally and/or alternatively, Wetzel seeks an order, pursuant to rules 21.01(l)(a), 21.01(l)(b) and/or 21.01(3)(d) of the Rules, striking and/or dismissing the Statement of Claim of Aviva, either in whole or in part, on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. Wetzel also seeks his costs of the motion on a substantial indemnity basis. Aviva, for its part, is not only opposing this motion, but has brought forth its own motion, pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 of the Rules, seeking to strike several paragraphs from Wetzel's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. (In order not to unduly complicate this Factum, a separate Responding Factum will be prepared and utilized by Wetzel in response to Aviva's motion.) Finally, the other named defendants in the herein action (<EM>i.e.</EM>, collectively the &ldquo;Warda Defendants&rdquo;) have brought forth their own Rule 21 motion, wherein they seek the dismissal of Aviva's action as it relates to themselves. Accordingly, three separate motions, one for each set of parties, will be heard contemporaneously before the same Judge on the selected motions hearing date of March 28, 2019. For the reasons to be given herein, Wetzel respectfully submits that his motion seeking summary dismissal of Aviva's claim be granted.</P></BLOCK1></BLOCK0>
<BLOCK0><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;BACKGROUND</TI>
<BLOCK1><N>A.</N><TI><EM>&ldquo;Project Bumper 1A&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P>2. Aviva, in a truly misguided attempt to identify and punish alleged fraudsters in the automobile accident repair business, embarked on a scheme which entailed damaging cars through deliberately staged (i.e., fake) car accidents, which were subsequently sent to auto body repair shops (i.e., the Warda Defendants) in order to determine the discrepancy (if any) between the true extent of the damage, as assessed and quantified by Aviva, on the one hand, and the reported damage, as assessed and invoiced by the defendants, on the other hand. <EM>See</EM> para. 6 of the Affidavit of Michael Wetzel, sworn November 2, 2018 (&ldquo;Wetzel Affidavit&rdquo;), found at Tab 2 of the Motion Record of the Defendant (Plaintiff by Counterclaim) Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel Motion Record&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The first of Aviva's schemes was code-named &ldquo;Project Bumper 1A&rdquo;. This scheme, and how it unfolded, was described in a confidential and internal Aviva memorandum as follows:
<QUOTE><P>This scenario utilized two Concealed Validation (CV) vehicles, a 2010 Ford Fusion SEL (CV004) and a 2012 Mazda 5GS (CV005). Both vehicles were equipped with hidden surveillance cameras capable of recording video only. Manufactured damage was created on both vehicles to simulate a collision between the two. The damage was appraised. The vehicles were then driven by individual private investigators (UC) from two different Private Investigation companies to a pre-arranged location to commence the collision scenario. The following Synopsis is in regards to CV004&mdash;the 2010 Ford Fusion.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, April 26, 2017, Aviva Canada investigators met with Discovery Group of Investigators (DGI) representatives. A scenario briefing package was supplied and a briefing took place.</P>
<P>On Monday May 8, 2017, the Aviva Canada investigators met with Wally Clark, an independent appraiser from Niagara Appraisal Services, and John Sandeman, a videographer from Video Support Services, at an arranged location. <UNDER>The Aviva Canada investigators damaged CV004 and CV005 in a mock collision</UNDER>. Mr. Clark appraised the damage. The damage and appraisal were video recorded by Mr. Sandeman.</P>
<P>The subsequent appraisal report from Mr. Clark placed the damage estimate to CV004 at $2,561.54, which included parts and labour [...]</P>
<P>On this same date, following the damage and appraisal Aviva Canada investigators met with representative from DGI at this same location. A briefing took place. Representatives from Secureye activated the In-Car Cameras. CV004 was then turned over to a UC from DGI. The UC was fitted with audio and video recording equipment.</P>
<P>CV004 was driven to a pre-staging area. A Surveillance Operator (SO) from DGI was assigned and present in a separate vehicle. After a briefing at the pre-staging area, the UC drove CV004 to the scenario location. The SO drove their vehicle to the surveillance location.</P>
<P>At approximately 12:00 PM, the UC arrived at the scenario location on Queensway West east of Mavis Road, Mississauga and parked behind CV005.</P>
<P>The scenario set out that CV004 was southbound on Mavis Road and was in the process of making a left turn onto The Queensway. CV004 failed to stay in the left lane, drifted slightly into the right lane, and struck CV005. The UC in CV004 would be at fault.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P><UNDER>A fictitious Aviva Canada claim number 33920039 was created</UNDER> and provided to the shop and an appraisal inspection was assigned to an Aviva Canada staff appraiser to inspect CV004 and prepare an estimate.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>On Tuesday May 16, 2017, prior to the completion of the repairs, Aviva Canada was invoiced by Ace Collision Centres, acting for McLaren Collision Centre in the net amount of $4,208.02. This included the appraisal of Mr. Wetzel of $4,880.82 less $1,000 deductible, and a tow invoice from MC Auto Towing for $327.70. The adjuster acknowledged receipt and requested a completion date for repairs.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>At 1:14 PM [on June 1, 2017] the UC attended at McLaren Collision Centre to return the rental car and retrieve CV004. [...] The UC paid the $1000 deductible and after completing the return documents for the rental car, he was provided the key to CV004.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>The invoice for total repair costs including the tow bill submitted by Ace Collision Centres for McLaren Collision Centre and MC Auto Towing was $4,208.02 was paid in full by Aviva Canada. A cheque was issued in the amount of $4,208.02 to Ace Collision Centres on June 15, 2017. The cheque was deposited and cleared the bank on June 22, 2017.</P>
<P>On June 2, 2017, an invoice was received from Mississauga Car Rental for $1,186.22. A cheque was issued for this amount payable to Mississauga Car Rental on June 15, 2017. The cheque was deposited and cleared the bank on June 28, 2017.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>(Emphasis added.) <EM>See</EM> para. 7 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P1></P>
<P>4. After the Ford Fusion was retrieved by Aviva's private investigator, the car was immediately taken to a forensic engineering firm for examination, whose &ldquo;purpose [...] was to determine whether or not the following reported items of repair were completed, as per the insurance approved vehicle repair estimate, dated May 9, 2017.&rdquo; After completing their forensic examination, the firm concluded as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Based on our examination of the repaired 2010 Ford Fusion vehicle, it is our opinion that some of the observed and noted components and/or items listed herein, reported to have repaired/replaced, were not found to have been repaired/replaced. This conclusion is supported by the observed evidence on the subject vehicle at the time of our examination, as per the listed and identified items on the vehicle repair estimate.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>See</EM> para. 8 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>B.</N><TI><EM>&ldquo;Project Bumper Scenario 4B&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P>5. The second Aviva scheme was code-named &ldquo;Project Bumper Scenario 4B&rdquo;. This scheme, and how it unfolded, was also described in great detail in an internal and confidential Aviva memorandum. As with the previously described scheme, two vehicles were involved, this time however a 2012 Mazda 5 (CV005) and a 2016 Chrysler 200 (CV007). On September 21, 2017, in the presence of Mr. Clark (Aviva's outside appraiser) and Mr. Sandeman (the videographer), &ldquo;Aviva Canada investigators damaged CV005 and CV007 in a mock collision.&rdquo; Mr. Clark thereafter appraised the damage at $3,484.36. On the same date, both vehicles were then driven by Aviva's private investigators to a pre&mdash;arranged location in Mississauga, where they parked the vehicles &ldquo;at the side of roadway in the curb lane. Both UCs exited their vehicles and began to converse purporting to have just been in a collision.&rdquo; Thereafter, CV007 (the 2016 Chrysler 200) was towed to the McLaren Collision Centre, where a &ldquo;fictitious claim number 34028257 was provided to McLaren Collision Centre&rdquo;, and Wetzel was then assigned the task of appraising CV007. Wetzel then appraised the value of the repairs, with the total dollar value of the suggested repairs at $9,872.65. After the repairs had been completed, Aviva's private investigator, purporting to be the owner of the car, retrieved the vehicle on October 24, 2017. <EM>See</EM> para. 9 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P>
<P>6. The vehicle, once retrieved from the body shop on October 24, 2017, was then transported to a &ldquo;designated facility&rdquo; for examination by the forensic engineering firm of De Berardis Associates Incorporated, with the stated purpose being &ldquo;to determine whether or not the reported items of repair were completed, as per the insurance approved vehicle repair estimate, dated September 25, 2017&rdquo;. The firm, after completing their examination of the subject vehicle, concluded as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Based on our examination of the repaired 2016 Chrysler 200 vehicle, as well as our review of the photographs that were taken during the September 27, 2017 appraisal inspection, it is our opinion that many of the observed and noted components listed herein, which were reported to have been repaired/replaced, were found to not have been repaired/replaced. This conclusion is supported by the observed evidence on the subject vehicle at the time of our examination, as per the listed and identified components contained on the vehicle repair estimate, dated September 25, 2017.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>See</EM> para. 10 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>C.</N><TI><EM>Commencement of Action, Exchange of Pleadings and Scheduling of Motions</EM></TI>
<P>7. On April 22, 2018, Aviva commenced the herein action. In this action, Aviva seeks as against Wetzel the following relief:
<QUOTE><P>(i) &ldquo;damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of the duty of honest performance of a contract, unjust enrichment, and conspiracy to commit fraud, in the amount of $10,017.86&rdquo;;</P>
<P>(ii) &ldquo;damages in the amount of $100,000 for investigative costs&rdquo;;</P>
<P>(iii) &ldquo;punitive and exemplary damages in the sum of $200,000&rdquo;; and</P>
<P>(iv) pre- and post-judgment interest, and costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>See</EM> para. 2 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P1></P>
<P>8. In response to this action, Wetzel retained legal counsel, who thereafter prepared and served on his client's behalf a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, dated July 16, 2018. Subsequently, the Warda Defendants retained their own legal counsel, who similarly prepared and served on his clients' behalf a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, dated October 15, 2018. <EM>See</EM> paras. 3 and 4 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid</EM>.</P>
<P>9. Finally, at a 9:30 am in-chambers appointment before Justice Glustein on October 12, 2018, the learned Judge ordered that all three motions proceed contemporaneously for adjudication before the same Judge. (The in-chambers appointment had previously been ordered by Justice Diamond at Civil Practice Court to determine whether Aviva's pleadings motion had to be heard first or whether all motions could be heard together.) <BOLD><EM>See</EM></BOLD> para. 5 of the Wetzel Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;LAW AND ANALYSIS</TI>
<P>10. There are three issues that will be addressed in the herein motion. These issues are as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(i) Has Aviva, by admittedly engaging in the deliberate and willful destruction of property not owned by itself, which by definition qualifies as the criminal code violation of mischief, forfeited its right to sue on account of any damages that it may have sustained by virtue of the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>?;</P>
<P>(ii) Has Aviva, by admittedly paying monies under claims which it knew were fraudulent (on account of the staged accidents) and thus invalid under provincial insurance legislation, further forfeited its right to sue for damages as against any of the named defendants?; and</P>
<P>(iii) Notwithstanding any federal criminal or provincial insurance legislation, should Aviva's claim be dismissed, pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction, as an abuse of the process of the Court in that Aviva has instituted an action arising solely from its own fictitious &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;. In other words, should Aviva be prevented from pursuing this action on account of having engaged in what amounts to the civil equivalent of entrapment?</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>A.</N><TI><EM>Ex Turpi Causa</EM></TI>
<P>11. In the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Les Laboratoires Servier v. Apotex Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2014] UKSC 55</CITE></CASEREF> (per Lord Sumption), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>13. English law has a long-standing repugnance for claims which are founded on the claimant's own illegal or immoral acts. The law on this point was already well established when Lord Mansfield CJ articulated it in his celebrated statement of principle in <CASEREF><SOC>Holman v. Johnson</SOC><YEAR>1775</YEAR><CITE>1 Cowp. 34L, 343</CITE></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action on an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff's own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says that he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both are equally in fault, potior est condition defendentis.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield's formulation begs many questions. But as these citations show, two features of this area of law have been characteristic of it from the outset. <UNDER>First, it is a rule of law and not a mere discretionary power. Secondly, it is based on public policy, and not on the perceived balance of merits between the parties to any particular dispute</UNDER>.</P>
<P>(Emphasis added.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>1993 CanLII 141</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada (per McLachlin, J. (as she then was), for the majority), ruled in relevant part (at page 170) as follows: &ldquo;The power expressed in the maxim <EM>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</EM> finds its roots in the insistence of the courts that the judicial process not be used for abusive, illegal purposes.&rdquo; At page 171, the Supreme Court further stated as follows: &ldquo;The use of the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> to prevent abuse and misuse of the judicial process is well established in contract law and insurance law, where it provokes little controversy.&rdquo; Finally, at pages 175-176, the Supreme Court stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The narrow principle illustrated by the foregoing examples of accepted application of the maxim of <EM>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</EM> in tort, is that a plaintiff will not be allowed to profit from his or her wrongdoing. [...] A more satisfactory explanation for these cases, I would venture, is that to allow recovery in these cases would be to allow recovery for what is illegal. It would put the courts in the position of saying that the same conduct is both legal, in the sense of being capable of rectification by the court, and illegal. It would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is particularly important in this context that we bear in mind that the law must aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which&mdash;contract, tort, the criminal law&mdash;must be in essential harmony. [...] We thus see that the concern, put at its most fundamental, is with the integrity of the legal system.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>13. In <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 4</CITE></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada (per Rothstein, J.), ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[20] The question is, &ldquo;under what circumstances should the immoral or criminal conduct of a plaintiff bar the plaintiff from recovering damages to which he or she would otherwise be entitled&rdquo; (p. 169). The following principles and approach are established in <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC></CASEREF> and are applicable in the present case.
<P1>1. Application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine in the tort context invalidates otherwise valid and enforceable actions in tort (p. 169).</P1>
<P1>2. Therefore, its application must be based on a firm doctrinal foundation and be made subject to clear limits and should occur &ldquo;in very limited circumstances&rdquo; (p. 169).</P1>
<P1>3. The only justification for its application is the preservation of the integrity of the legal system. This concern is only in issue where a damage award in a civil suit would allow a person to profit from illegal or wrongful conduct or would permit evasion or rebate of a penalty prescribed by the criminal law (p. 169).
<QUOTE><P>It would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is particularly important in this context that we bear in mind that the law must aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which&mdash;contract, tort, the criminal law&mdash;must be in essential harmony. For the courts to punish conduct with the one hand while rewarding it with the other, would be to &ldquo;create an intolerable fissure in the law's conceptually seamless web&rdquo;: Weinrib, <EM>supra</EM>, at p. 42. We thus see that the concern, put at its most fundamental, is with the integrity of the legal system, [p. 176]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>4. The <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine generally does not preclude an award of damages in tort because such awards tend to compensate the plaintiff rather than amount to &ldquo;profit&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>Such damages accomplish nothing more than to put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in had the tort not occurred. ... [A plaintiff should get] only the value of, or a substitute for, the injuries he or she has suffered by the fault of another. <UNDER>He or she gets nothing for or by reason of the fact he or she was engaged in illegal conduct.</UNDER> [pp. 176-77]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>5. The <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is a defence in a tort action. The plaintiff's illegal conduct does not give rise to a judicial discretion to negate or refuse to consider the duty of care which goes to the relationship between a plaintiff and a defendant. It is independent of that relationship. The defendant may have caused harm by acting wrongly or negligently, but the &ldquo;responsibility for this wrong is suspended only because concern for the integrity of the legal system trumps the concern that the defendant be responsible&rdquo; (pp. 181-82).</P1>
<P1>6. Treating the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine as a defence places the onus on the defendant to prove the illegal or immoral conduct that precludes the plaintiff's action. And as a defence, it allows for segregation between claims for personal injury and claims that would constitute profit from illegal or immoral conduct or the evasion of or a rebate of a penalty provided by the criminal law.</P1></P>
<P>(Emphasis added.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. Finally, in the recent decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Apotex Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories Limited</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 7736</CITE></CASEREF> (per Lederer, J.), the Court therein ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[37] To differ between breaches of contract, tortious acts and the criminal law, making a breach of the first and acting on the second something less than illegal, and the third as the instance where the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> would apply would serve to render the law inconsistent and raise questions about its overall integrity.</P></QUOTE></P>

<P>17. Aviva has of course readily conceded that it deliberately (and thus wilfully) damaged the vehicles, which damages it assessed in the thousands of dollars (<EM>i.e.</EM>, over $5,000). However, it has sought to negate this mischief on the theory that the vehicles damaged were its own. However, Aviva's own evidence clearly and unequivocally establishes that they were not.</P>
<P>18. In particular, at para. 10 of the Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan, sworn December 13, 2018 (&ldquo;Dunstan Affidavit&rdquo;), found at Tab 1 of the Responding Motion Record of the Plaintiff/Defendant by Counterclaim, Aviva Canada Inc., the deponent therein swore as follows: &ldquo;The two subject vehicles, a 2010 Ford Fusion and a 2016 Chrysler 200 were each lawfully purchased by <UNDER>2526895 Ontario Inc.</UNDER> [&ldquo;252&rdquo;]&rdquo; (emphasis added).</P>
<P>19. Despite acknowledging that the two subject vehicles were owned by 252, Aviva has sought to negate the separate corporate personality of this numbered company by essentially asking that the proverbial &ldquo;corporate veil&rdquo; be lifted, and thus ha ve it nothing more than Aviva's alter ego. Thus, Aviva's deponent swore as follows:
<QUOTE><P>On July 11, 2016, the Plaintiff incorporated the numbered company [252]. Aviva has complete control of the numbered company. The directors of the numbered company are Gregory D. Somerville (Aviva's former CEO), Colin L. Simpson (Aviva's CFO) and Sharon Sandall (a former Corporate Secretary at Aviva). As directors, these individuals act solely as agents for Aviva. Any actions of the numbered company were for the sole benefit of Aviva.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>See</EM> para. 9 of the Dunstan Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM></P1></P>
<P>20. Assuming in <EM>arguendo</EM> that Aviva does indeed have &ldquo;complete contro numbered company&rdquo;, does this mean that we can ignore the separate corpora of 252 and simply treat it as being one and the same as Aviva? The answer to it is respectfully submitted, is unquestionably &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21. In the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corporation</SOC><CITE>2018 ONCA 472</CITE></CASEREF> (per Hourigan, J.A.), the Court therein ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[65] <EM>Kosmopoulos</EM> was decided approximately thirty years ago. Not surprisingly, the law has developed. The starting point is the decision of Sharpe J., as he then was, in <EM>Transamerica</EM>. Justice Sharpe rejected the notion that the test for piercing a corporate veil is &ldquo;anything like a just and equitable standard&rdquo; (p. 433). Relying on Gower: <EM>Principles of Modern Company Law</EM>, 5th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1992), he found, at p. 433, <UNDER>that there are only three circumstances where the court will pierce a corporate veil</UNDER>:
<QUOTE><P>(1) When the court is construing a statute, contract or other document;</P>
<P>(2) When the court is satisfied that a company is a &ldquo;mere facade&rdquo; concealing the true facts; and</P>
<P>(3) When it can be established that the company is an authorized agent of its controllers or its members, corporate or human.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[66] With respect to cases where it is alleged that a subsidiary corporation is a mere facade that protects its parent corporation, in order to ignore the corporate separateness principle, the court must be satisfied that: (i) there is complete control of the subsidiary, such that the subsidiary is the &ldquo;mere puppet&rdquo; of the parent corporation; <UNDER>and</UNDER> (ii) the subsidiary was incorporated for a fraudulent or improper purpose or used by the parent as a shell for improper activity: <EM>Transamerica</EM>, at pp. 433-34.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>[76] Not only is such an argument problematic from a policy standpoint, it comes dangerously close to the adoption of the group enterprise theory of liability. That theory holds that where several corporations operate closely as part of the same &ldquo;group&rdquo; of corporations, they are in reality a single enterprise and should, accordingly, be responsible for each other's debts. <UNDER>It has been consistently rejected by our courts</UNDER>. It has also been rejected in England.</P>
<P>(Emphasis added; internal citations omitted.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>22. Prior to analyzing the three listed circumstances identified by the Court of Appeal in <EM>Yaiguaje</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, to the facts at bar, it is important to note that it is Aviva itself who seeks to pierce the corporate veil of its own subsidiary (<EM>i.e.</EM>, 252) in the hope of avoiding criminal liability and the consequences flowing therefrom. This differs radically from the usual scenario wherein some third party creditor seeks to pierce the corporate veil of another company in the hope of attaching liability to it for the purposes of collecting on its debt or claim. The undersigned is not aware of any authority where this has been allowed to occur. In fact, the exact opposite has been found. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. National Money Mart Co.</SOC><CITE>2006 CanLII 14958</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal for Ontario (per Feldman, J.A.) ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[19] The motion judge relied on the tort claim and found that the tort arguably occurred in Ontario. She was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of a good, arguable case that the two defendants conspired together to carry out the breach of s. 347(1) of the Code. Contrary to the submission of the appellant, there can be a conspiracy between a parent and a subsidiary corporation. The appellant submits that if Money Mart was controlled by Dollar Financial to the extent alleged in the action, then it follows that any agreement between them would be tantamount to an agreement with oneself, and one cannot conspire with oneself. Although that is an interesting analysis, the appellant's position is that the two companies are independent of each other and do not operate as one. <UNDER>Either way, where one controls the other, as two separate legal entities each remains responsible in law for its own actions, even if Dollar Financial is also responsible for some or all of the actions of its subsidiary.</UNDER></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, despite its alleged complete control of 252, Aviva &ldquo;remains responsible in law for its own actions&rdquo;, including its actions in the case at bar that amounted to criminal mischief.</P>
<P>23. Turning our attention now to the three &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; identified in <EM>Yaiguaje</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, Aviva does not of course allege that 252 was incorporated for &ldquo;a fraudulent or improper purpose&rdquo;. Accordingly, circumstance (2) cannot apply since this is a required condition. Neither does circumstance (1), since the Court is not being asked to construe any statute or document. This leave only circumstance (3), which is also inapplicable. Though Aviva has alleged that the directors of 252 act as its agents, it has not alleged that 252 itself acts as Aviva's agent (nor can it). The reason for this is obvious: According to Aviva's own evidence, 252 entered into two separate contracts of insurance with Aviva, which contracts were evidenced through the issuance of two separate automobile insurance policies. Since one cannot contract with oneself, <EM>ipso facto</EM>, 252 cannot be &ldquo;an authorized agent&rdquo; acting on behalf of Aviva and thus cannot satisfy circumstance (3). In addition, as the Court made clear in <EM>Yaiguaje</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, the &ldquo;group enterprise theory&rdquo; has been consistently rejected by courts in both Canada and in England. Accordingly, even if 252 can be said to be part of the &ldquo;Aviva group of companies&rdquo;, it retains its separate legal personality as a matter of law. <EM>See</EM> para. 13 of the Dunstan Affidavit, <EM>ibid</EM>.</P>
<P>24. Having established that Aviva did in fact engage in criminal mischief by deliberately damaging two vehicles owned by another company, which criminal act <UNDER>directly</UNDER> caused all of the damages that it is currently seeking from the herein defendants, the <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> doctrine applies with full force to bar this action. As the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, stated succinctly and forcefully: &ldquo;He or she gets nothing for or by reason of the fact he or she was engaged in illegal conduct.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>C.</N><TI><EM>Aviva's Payout Under Known Fraudulent Conditions</EM></TI>
<P>25. As previously mentioned, Aviva has admitted that both vehicles, which were owned by 252 at all relevant times, were insured under &ldquo;valid and active policies of automobile insurance&rdquo;. <EM>See</EM> para. 13 of the Dunstan Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM> However, despite the admitted fact that the claims submitted in regards to both staged accidents were &ldquo;fictitious&rdquo;, Aviva nonetheless still chose to pay under those policies, even though those policies were void as a matter of law. This fact was made abundantly clear in the following passages from the Dunstan Affidavit:
<QUOTE><P>12. The Plaintiff had no intent to defraud the Defendants. In fact, the plaintiff paid the Warda Defendants' invoices, notwithstanding what it believes to be fraudulent charges. In this action Aviva seeks to recover, among other things, the payments made for the fraudulent charges.</P>

<P>14. The Plaintiff had full knowledge of the claims and was not committing fraud against itself.</P></QUOTE>

<P>26. The relevant provisions of the Ontario <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended (&ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;) read as follows:

<P>27. In the case at bar, there is no question that the insured (<EM>i.e.</EM>, 252) &ldquo;wilfully [made] a false statement in respect of a claim under the contract&rdquo; by knowingly submitting the two claims on account of the staged (fake) accidents. Accordingly, pursuant to subsection 233(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, the &ldquo;claim by the insured [was] invalid and the right of the insured to recover indemnity [was] forfeited&rdquo;. Accordingly, it is manifestly illogical (and unlawful) for Aviva to now seek damages from the defendants on account of claims that (i) it knew were fraudulent, (ii) it knew were void as a matter of law; and yet (iii) it still decided to pay them out.</P>

<P>[...]</P>
<P>In the context that interests us here, the doctrine of abuse of process engages &ldquo;the inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a way that would ... bring the administration of justice into disrepute&rdquo; (<CASEREF><SOC>Canam Enterprises Inc. v.

<QUOTE><P>The doctrine of abuse of process engages the inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a way that would be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation before it or would in some other way bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

<P>30. In the case at bar, there are many &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; aspects of this case which militate strongly in favour of dismissal as against Aviva's claim. First, Aviva is seeking as against all defendants $100,000 for its &ldquo;investigative costs&rdquo;. This is highly problematic not only because its actual &ldquo;damages&rdquo; (<EM>i.e.</EM>, what it claims was over-billed) were only approximately $10,000, but it also literally creates the specter of <UNDER>unlimited</UNDER> liability for these defendants (and any others similarly situated) since a company like Aviva can literally spend hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of dollars on its &ldquo;investigative costs&rdquo;, had it so chosen, and thus financially ruin the defendants. This cannot be allowed to happen. Second, the action is &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; in that, as already mentioned numerous times herein, the accidents were all staged by Aviva and thus created by it. In other words, this is not a case of a real-world accident, which was subsequently investigated by Aviva to determine whether billed work was actually performed as indicated. Finally, this case is &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; in that it amounts to the civil equivalent of entrapment. In particular, in the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imoro</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 122</CITE></CASEREF> (per Laskin, J.A.), the Court of Appeal ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[10] Lamer J. struck the balance between these objectives by concluding that entrapment arises in either of two situations: first, when state authorities, acting without reasonable suspicion or for an improper purpose, provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence; and second, even having reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a good faith inquiry, the police go beyond providing an opportunity to commit a crime and actually induce the commission of an offence.</P>
<P>[11] Ordinarily, when entrapment is claimed, the essential elements of the offence charged have been made out. However, if entrapment is subsequently found, the court will not allow the Crown to maintain a conviction because to do so would be an abuse of process and bring the administration of justice in disrepute. So instead, the court will stay the proceedings.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. In the case at bar, Aviva has conceded that the damaged vehicles were &ldquo;randomly towed to the Warda Defendants body shop in the normal course of an insurance claim.&rdquo; <EM>See</EM> para. 11 of the Dunstan Affidavit, <EM>ibid.</EM> Accordingly, Aviva acted as against both Wetzel and the Warda Defendants &ldquo;without reasonable suspicion&rdquo;. In addition, and with the proviso of course that no wrongdoing whatsoever is conceded by any of the defendants, Aviva provided the opportunity to commit the claimed offence. In other words, if it wasn't for Aviva's staged accidents, no opportunity for any wrongdoing in the case at bar would have arisen.</P>
<P>32. <EM>En passant</EM>, it is also important to note that Aviva's claim itself may be viewed as being &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; and thus, by its nature, an abuse of the process of the Court. In the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Cannon v. Funds for Canada Foundation</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 399</CITE></CASEREF> (per G.R. Strathy, J., as he then was), the Court therein ruled in relevant part as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[187] <UNDER>Fraud is the deprivation of another's property by dishonest means</UNDER>. While many of the classic definitions of fraud have a component of false representation (see <CASEREF><SOC>Parna v. G. &amp; S. Properties Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, above, at S.C.R. 316) or deceit (see <CASEREF><SOC>Re London and Globe Finance Corp.</SOC><CITE>[1903] 1 Ch. 728</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1900-3] All E.R.

For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Scott v. Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis</SOC><CITE>[1974] 3 All E.R. 1032</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1975] A.C. 819</CITE></CORRELAT><CORRELAT><CITE>60 Cr.

<QUOTE><P>The definition of &ldquo;defraud&rdquo; in the <EM>London and Globe Finance</EM> case is not exhaustive and the word ordinarily means: &ldquo;... to deprive a person dishonestly of something which is his or of something to which he is or would or might but for the perpetration of the fraud, be entitled.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[188] This is consistent with the definition of the criminal offence of fraud set out in s. 380 of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46:
<QUOTE><P>Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security ...[is guilty of an offence].

<P>33. Accordingly, by instituting this action, Aviva is trying to deprive Wetzel and the Warda Defendants of their property (<EM>i.e.</EM>, money) through &ldquo;dishonest means&rdquo;, as evidenced by the staged car accidents and the fictitious insurance claims.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>34. Aviva, in a truly over-zealous and misguided effort to curb what it believed to be fraudulent practices in the automobile accident body-shop repair business and the appraisers who appraise such accidents, embarked on an entirely unlawful scheme which entailed the deliberate staging of car accidents and the subsequent filing of fictitious insurance claims arising therefrom. The scheme was unlawful and criminal in that it involved the offence of criminal mischief over $5,000. The vehicles, as evidenced by Aviva itself, were owned by another company. Aviva cannot as a matter of law pierce the proverbial &ldquo;corporate veil&rdquo; and claim that this numbered company does not exist or that it is its mere alter ego. Having thus committed a criminal act, the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> acts to debar Aviva's claim in its entirety. In addition, Aviva cannot recover for &ldquo;losses&rdquo; that it itself caused. It knew that the submitted claims were fraudulent, which thus voided the contracts of insurance between 252, as the insured, and Aviva, as the insurer. Finally, Aviva's action is an abuse of the process of the Court in that, <EM>inter alia</EM>, it amounts to the civil equivalent of entrapment.</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. A total of three motions are being brought concurrently. All of the parties involved in this action have brought motions. The defendant Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;) is seeking the following relief:
<P2>a) An Order, pursuant to Rule 20.01(3) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, dismissing, either in whole or in part, the Statement of Claim of the plaintiff Aviva Canada Inc. as it relates specifically to Wetzel;</P2>
<P2>b) Additionally and/or alternatively, Wetzel seeks an order pursuant to rules 21.1(1)(a), 21.01(1)(b) and/or 21.01(3)(d) of the <EM>Rules</EM>, striking and/or dismissing the Statement of Claim of Aviva, either in whole or in part, on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court; and</P2>
<P2>c) Costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</P2></P1>
<P1>2. The plaintiff and 1843538 Ontario Inc. c.o.b. Mississauga Collision Centre, and/or McLaren Collision, Fady Warda and Rony Amanuel Warda (Collectively, &ldquo;the Warda Defendants&rdquo;) will also be arguing motions on the return date of March 28, 2019. All three motions were scheduled to be heard on the same date as per the Order of Justice Glustein dated October 12, 2018.</P1>
<P1>3. The plaintiff is bringing a motion pursuant to Rules 21.01, 25.06 and 25.11 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> to strike paragraphs from both the Warda defendants' and Wetzel's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>4. The Warda defendants are moving under Rule 21.01(1)(a) and 21.01(1)(b) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P><P1>5. By Statement of Claim issued on April 23, 2018, the plaintiff commenced an action to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of duty of honest performance of a contract, unjust enrichment, and conspiracy to commit fraud. Additionally, the plaintiff sought to recover damages for trespass to property, investigative costs and punitive and exemplary damages.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 3.</P1>
<P1>6. Wetzel delivered his Statement of Defence and Counterclaim on July 16, 2018.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 4.</P1>
<P1>7. The Warda defendants delivered their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim on October 15, 2018.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 5.</P1>
<P1>8. The moving party was at all material times employed as a Senior Auto Damage Appraiser by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Aviva, determined that Wetzel, during the course of his employment, knowingly engaged in serious breaches of conduct. This included but is not limited to a breach of Aviva Canada's Code of Conduct.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at paras 6 and 8.</P1>
<P1>9. The plaintiff incorporated its numbered company 2526895 Ontario Inc. (&ldquo;252&rdquo;) on July 11, 2016. Aviva is the only shareholder of the numbered company and has complete control of it. Any actions of said numbered company were for the sole benefit of Aviva. The two subject vehicles involved in the plaintiffs investigation were lawfully purchased by 252.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at paras 9 and 10.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Supplementary Motion Record at Tab 8.</P1>
<P1>10. As part of its investigation, the plaintiff damaged these vehicles in a safe and controlled setting. Following the damage, the vehicles were randomly towed to the Warda defendants' body shop in the normal course of an insurance claim.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 11.</P1>
<P1>11. Prior to the vehicles being towed to the Warda defendants' body shop, the plaintiff had its own independent appraisals conducted. These were done prior to the appraisal and repairs being completed by the defendants. The moving defendant in this motion, Wetzel, completed routine appraisals in the regular course of business on each of the subject vehicles at the Warda defendants' body shop.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at paras 15 and 16.</P1>
<P1>12. After the subject vehicles were returned by the Warda defendants to the plaintiff, further independent appraisals were done to inspect the work that was completed. The completed work was compared against the appraisals and invoices submitted to the plaintiff and the prior appraisals conducted by the plaintiff. It was discovered that Wetzel included parts on the appraisal as being required to be replaced which in fact were not damaged and did not need to be replaced. Additionally, various parts were included on his appraisals as requiring refinishing when in fact they were not damaged and did not require refinishing. Finally, various parts were listed on the appraisal to be replaced and/or refinished which had not initially been damaged prior to the vehicle being taken to the Warda defendants, but were deliberately damaged by the Warda defendants, as revealed by discreet video recorded from the vehicle while it was in the shop of the Warda defendants.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 22.</P1>
<P1>13. As part of its Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; productions in its draft Affidavit of Documents, the plaintiff provided the defendants with a detailed synopsis of the events that gave rise to its claim.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Supplementary Motion Record&mdash;Tab 9 Supplementary Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at para 3.</P1>
<P1>14. In addition to a detailed synopsis of each claim, the plaintiff included appendices outlining the issues and unjustified invoicing identified along with a separate set of appendices outlining the supporting evidence in its Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; documents.</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P><P1>15. <BOLD>Whether the Court should grant summary judgement and dismiss all or part of the claim in the Statement of Claim as against Wetzel pursuant to Rule 20.01(3).</BOLD> The plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial and its claim should not be dismissed.</P1>
<P1>16. <BOLD>Whether the Court should strike and /or dismiss of all or part of the Statement of Claim as against Wetzel pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a).</BOLD> The plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that it would be inappropriate to strike all or part of the action on these grounds.</P1>
<P1>17. <BOLD>Whether the Court should strike and/or dismiss all or part of the Statement of Claim as against Wetzel pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(b).</BOLD> The plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that it has disclosed a reasonable cause of action. As such, it would be inappropriate to strike and/or dismiss the Statement of Claim on these grounds.</P1>
<P1>18. <BOLD>Whether the Court should strike and/or dismiss all or part of the Statement of Claim as against Wetzel pursuant to Rule 21.01(3)(d).</BOLD> The plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that the action is not an abuse of the process of the Court. As such, it would be inappropriate to strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim on these grounds.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;STATEMENT OF LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Rule 20</EM></TI>
<P><P1>19. Summary judgment motions serve to prevent &ldquo;claims or defences that have no chance of success from proceeding to trial...as trying unmeritorious claims imposes a heavy price in terms of time and cost on the parties to the litigation and on the justice system&rdquo;; however, the summary judgment rules have evolved to provide a legitimate alternative means for adjudicating and resolving disputes.</P1>

<P1>Tab 2 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>20. The <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> provide that a Court shall grant summary judgment if the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 20.04(2)(a).</P1>
<P1>21. In determining whether there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, Rule 20.04(2.1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> establishes that:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he Court shall consider the evidence submitted by the parties and, if the determination is being made by a judge, the judge may exercise any of the following powers for the purpose, unless it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercises only at a trial:
<P1>1. Weighing the evidence.</P1>
<P1>2. Evaluation the creditability of a deponent.</P1>
<P1>3. Drawing any reasonable inference from the evidence.</P1></P></QUOTE></P1>

<P1>22. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, the leading case on summary judgment, the Supreme Court of Canada held that:
<QUOTE><P>There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits on a Motion for summary judgment. This will be the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2014] 1 S.C.R. 87</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> Tab 1 of the plaintiffs Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>23. In <EM>Hryniak</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada outlined the approach a Court should apply to summary judgment Motions: first, it must first determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial based only on the evidence provided, without the use of the new fact finding powers. Second, if it appears that there is a genuine issue for trial then the Court is to determine whether a trial can be avoided by exercising the powers in <EM>Rule</EM> 20.04(2.1) and (2.2). As explained by Justice Karakatsanis:
<QUOTE><P>If there appears to be a genuine issue requiring a trial, [a judge] should then determine if the need for a trial can be avoided by using the new powers under Rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2), [a judge] may at her discretion, use those powers, provided that their use is not against the interest of justice. Their use will not be against the interest of justice if they will lead to a fair and just result and will serve the goals of timeliness, affordability and proportionality in light of the ligation as a whole.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2014] 1 S.C.R. 87</CITE><PARANUM>66</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> Tab 1 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>24. The standard for fairness is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the judge confidence that he or she can find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles to resolve the dispute. Any concerns about credibility or clarification of the evidence can often be addressed by calling oral evidence on the Motion itself.</P1>

<P1>25. While the rule for summary judgment Motions has been modified and its intended interpretation has been clarified, the guiding principles remain the same and parties to the Motion are still required to put their &lsquo;best foot forward&rsquo;. As expressed by Justice M.L. Edwards in <CASEREF><SOC>Theiventhirampillai v. City of Toronto</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>In responding to a Motion for summary judgment, a party...is required to put forward all evidence on which he intends to rely at the hearing of the Motion and cannot in response to the Motion, simply suggest that there may be other evidence available which might assist in establishing a claim.</P></QUOTE></P1>

<P><P1>26. A complete analysis of Rule 21.01(1)(a) is also found in the plaintiffs responding factum to the Warda defendants' motion. This analysis occurs at paragraphs eleven (11) thru fifteen (15). For ease of reference, the law will be repeated below.</P1>
<P1>27. Rule 21.01(1)(a) allows for a party to move before a judge for the determination, before trial, of a question of law raised by a pleading in an action where the determination of the question may dispose of all or part of the action, substantially shorten the trial or result in a substantial saving of costs.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 21.01(1)(a).</P1>
<P1>28. The Court in <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro</SOC></CASEREF> decided that the &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; test is the relevant test for both subrules (a) and (b) of rule 21.01(1).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro</SOC><CITE>19 O.R. (3d) 529</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 4 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>29. In addition to the plain and obvious test, the Court has previously considered when it would be appropriate to bring a motion to dispose of a point of law. In <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Lieff, commented on what was then Rule 124, which allowed for a point of law to be set down for a hearing at any time before the trial. Justice Lieff decided that the defendant's proper procedure is to bring a motion for a judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings are complete. This principle was later adopted by the Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. CanadianBroadcasting Corp. et al.</SOC><YEAR>1975</YEAR><CITE>8 O.R. (2d) 55</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>

<P1>Tab 6 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>30. According to Rule 25.05 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, pleadings in an action are closed when, (a) the plaintiff has delivered a reply to every defence in the action or the time for delivery of a reply has expired.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 25.05(a).</P1>
<P1>31. In <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. (Liquidator of) v. CUMIS General Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, D.M. Brown J., conducted an analysis of the relevant case law related to Rule 21.01(1)(a) motions. The following general principles were extracted from the case law:
<P2>i. the rule is not designed to answer questions of law where material facts are in dispute or, put another way, where no agreement exists on the material facts which underpin the question of law posed;</P2>
<P2>ii. a party should not use Rule 21 to secure the advice of the court about the soundness of its cause of action or defence by asking the court to assume that the material facts it has pleaded will be proved at trial, thereby asking the court to answer a hypothetical question. However, the hypothetical to be avoided is one where an underpinning of the legal determination sought under Rule 21 might be altered at trial, and the legal determination thus rendered redundant;</P2>
<P2>iii. a defendant should not move for the determination of a question of law involving the applicability of a limitation period...;</P2>
<P2>iv. where the question of law depends on the construction of a contract, the terms of which are unclear and capable of more than one meaning, Rule 21 is not an appropriate device to use to anshwer the question; and</P2>
<P2>v. matters of law which have not been settled fully in the jurisprudence usually should not be disposed of at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. (liquidator of) v. CUMIS General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 6107</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Rule 21.01(1)(b)</EM></TI>
<P><P1>32. As was the case with Rule 21.01(1)(a), the plaintiff provided the Court with a full analysis of Rule 21.01(1)(b) in its responding factum to the Warda defendants' motion. This analysis is found at paragraphs twenty-five (25) thru thirty (30). For ease of reference, the law will be repeated below.</P1>
<P1>33. Rule 21.01(1)(b) allows for a pleading to be struck on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01(1)(b).</P1>
<P1>34. Rule 21.01(2) stipulates that no evidence is admissible on a motion under 21.01(1)(b).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01 (2).</P1>
<P1>35. The test that is applied to determine whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action or defence is the &ldquo;plain and obvious test.&rdquo; The moving party must show that it is plain, obvious and beyond doubt that the respondent could not succeed in the claim or defence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 8 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>36. The power of the Court to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is a valuable housekeeping measure that is essential to effective and fair litigation. By properly exercising the power to strike, the Court can unclutter the proceeding and weed out the hopeless claims. This ensures that only those claims that have some chance of success go on to a trial.</P1>

<P1>Tab 8 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>37. A motion to strike for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence proceeds on the basis that the facts pleaded are true, unless they are manifestly incapable of being proven. Additionally, no evidence is permissible on such a motion.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 8 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>38. Whether the evidence substantiates the pleaded facts, now or at some future date, is irrelevant to the motion to strike. The judge on the motion to strike cannot consider what evidence adduced in the future might or might not show. To require the judge to do so would be to gut the motion to strike of its logic and ultimately render it useless.</P1>

<P><P1>42. Wetzel, as the moving party, is relying on Rules 20, 21.01(1)(a), 21.01(1)(b) and 21.01(3)(d) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. Part III of his factum fails to distinguish the Rules as applied to the moving party's individual arguments. In an attempt to accurately respond to the arguments presented, the plaintiff and responding party will address the arguments in the order that they appear. The plaintiff and responding party must assume that the arguments are being made under each rule, since the material does not distinguish same.</P1>
<P1>43. At Paragraph 10 of his Factum, Wetzel identifies three central issues to be addressed in the herein motion. The issues are:
<P2>i. Has Aviva, by admittedly engaging in the deliberate and willful destruction of property not owned by itself, which by definition qualifies as the criminal code violation of mischief, forfeited its right to sue on account of any damages that it may have sustained by virtue of the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>?;</P2>
<P2>ii. Has Aviva, by admittedly paying monies under claims which it knew were fraudulent (on account of the staged accidents) and thus invalid under provincial insurance legislation, further forfeited its right to sue for damages as against any of the named defendants'; and</P2>
<P2>iii. Notwithstanding any federal criminal or provincial insurance legislation, should Aviva's claim be dismissed, pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction as an abuse of the process of the Court in that Aviva has instituted an action arising solely from its own fictitious &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; In other words, should Aviva be prevented from pursuing this action on account of having engaged in what amounts to the civil equivalent of entrapment.</P2></P1></P>

<P><P1>44. The moving party's factum then dives into an analysis of the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> under heading &ldquo;A.&rdquo; Wetzel begins his analysis of the doctrine by citing the United Kingdom decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Les Laboratoires Servier v. Apotex Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>. The responding party respectfully submits that very little weight, if any, should be attributed to the decision. It is a 2014 decision that cites an ancient English case decided in the year 1775. Canadian Courts have had the opportunity to address the doctrine and the Canadian jurisprudence on the issue has steadily evolved since the leading Supreme Court of Canada decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1>

<P1>Tab 12 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>45. The plaintiff and responding party to this motion agrees with paragraph thirteen (13) of the moving party's (Wetzel's) factum, which outlines the six principles of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> that were established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 13 of the plaintiffs Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>46. In the case at hand, the Court must strongly consider the first two principles of applying the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> as established by <EM>Zastowny</EM>. Those principles are: (1) application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine in the tort context invalidates otherwise valid and enforceable actions in tort; and (2) therefore, its application must be based on a firm doctrinal foundation and be made subject to clear limits and should occur in very limited circumstances.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastonmy</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 13 of the plaintiffs Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>47. In <EM>Hall</EM>, the illegal conduct involved a drinking and driving incident that resulted in a vehicle rollover and significant head injuries. The driver had consumed 11 or 12 bottles of beer before taking the wheel. In <EM>Hall</EM> it was decided that the plaintiff need not be denied recovery as the compensation sought was for his injuries. Justice McLachlin stated that this could be reduced to the extent of the appellants contributory negligence, but cannot be wholly denied by reason of his disreputable or criminal conduct.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hall v. Hebert</SOC><CITE>[1993] S.C.J. No. 51</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 12 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>48. In <EM>Zastowny</EM>, the plaintiff had been previously assaulted by an officer at a correctional centre. A psychologist later opined that the plaintiff's subsequent criminality resulted from the assaults. The plaintiff claimed for wage loss while incarcerated. His argument was that the reason he was incarcerated then for crimes committed, was due to the prior sexual assaults. The Court decided to apply the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi</EM> to bar damages for wage loss due to time spent in incarceration. Allowing these damages would introduce an inconsistency in the fabric of the law that compromised the integrity of the justice system. The Court reasoned that Zastowny was asking to be indemnified for the consequences of the commission of crimes for which he was found criminally responsible (and for which the prior sexual abuse did not provide a defence).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>6, 8 and 30</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 13 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>49. The plaintiff and responding party respectfully submits that the facts at hand are easily distinguishable from the high profile instances where the doctrine has been considered. Importantly, in the case at hand, the criminal and immoral conduct as against the plaintiff by the defendants has only been alleged. The plaintiff's position is that its conduct was neither illegal nor immoral. It damaged its own vehicles and sent them out for repair. This is hardly immoral and was not illegal. There is no foundation in law that would classify its actions as illegal or immoral. In <EM>Zastowny</EM>, on the other hand, the illegality of the party had clearly been established. The plaintiff in that instance had already been incarcerated. In such a scenario, it is clear that without application of the doctrine, an inconsistency would be introduced into the fabric of the law that would compromise the integrity of the justice system. The very fabric of the law and the integrity of the justice system would be left unharmed in the present scenario, where the moving party has only brought forth an unproven allegation of mischief. In fact, if the plaintiff's allegations are proven, there is a very real societal interest in having the defendants face civil justice.</P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ex Turpi Causa Argument as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P><P1>50. The <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> argument advanced by Wetzel as the moving party is directly tied to their allegations of criminal mischief. As such, we will apply the <EM>Rules</EM> to these arguments following a discussion of the mischief allegation.</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>B.</EM></N><TI><EM>Aviva's Criminal Mischief</EM></TI>
<P><P1>51. The plaintiff and responding party agrees that Wetzel has correctly set out the offence of mischief by citing Section 430 and Section 429(3) of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM> in paragraphs fifteen (15) and sixteen (16) of the moving factum.</P1>
<P1>Reference: <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 430 and 429(3).</P1>
<P1>52. The plaintiff and responding party disagrees with Wetzel's analysis of the ownership of the vehicles and disagrees with his legal analysis regarding &ldquo;piercing the corporate veil&rdquo;. The plaintiff does, in fact, own the vehicles in question. As such, since it has total interest in the damaged property, the defendants would need to rely on Section 429(3) of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM>. Section 429(3)(b) states that the fact that a person has a total interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence <EM>if he caused the destruction or damage with intent to defraud</EM> (emphasis added). If properly applied to the facts at hand, the allegation of mischief would turn on whether or not the plaintiff had an intention to defraud the defendants. The plaintiff's intent was to see if auto body repair shops behaved honestly, or the extent to which they didn't.</P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Mischief and Ex Turpi Causa Argument as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Rule 20</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>53. We will first consider these arguments under Rule 20 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. As outlined, summary judgment will only be granted if the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence. Given the mechanics of the allegations and the unorthodox defences of mischief and <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, the plaintiff and responding party respectfully submits that the necessary findings of fact cannot be made. Granting a summary judgement in this instance, would not achieve a just result, as there are clearly genuine issues requiring a trial.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2014] 1 S.C.R. 87</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 1 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>54. The fact that there are genuine issues requiring a trial was conceded by Wetzel in his testimony during cross-examination on his affidavit. At page twenty-nine (29) of the transcript there is a discussion on the need to establish a genuine issue for trial. At page thirty (30), line nineteen (19), the defendant was asked to agree that there is a dispute as to whether or not Wetzel's appraisals were deliberately inaccurate. Counsel for the defendant then agreed, from lines twenty-two (22) to twenty-four (24), that there is a dispute between what Wetzel has done and what the plaintiff claims. This is the very root of the claims as against Wetzel. Even if there were a proper legal foundation for the defence of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, which the plaintiff says there isn't, it would require a trial on the facts to determine, among other things, whether an offence was committed by the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Supplementary Responding Motion Record, Tab 1 at pages 29-30.</P1>
<P1>55. If there appears to be a genuine issue requiring trial, which the plaintiff submits that there is, the Court should then determine if the need for a trial can be avoided by invoking Rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2). Use of these Rules will not be against the interest of justice if they will lead to a fair and just result.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2014] 1 S.C.R. 87</CITE><PARANUM>66</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 1 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>56. Rule 20.04(2.1) stipulates a series of powers that the motion Judge may exercise when hearing a summary judgement motion. These powers may be used, <EM>unless</EM> it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercised only at a trial: (1) weighing the evidence; (2) evaluating the credibility of a deponent; and (3) drawing any reasonable inference from the evidence (emphasis added).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 20.04(2.1).</P1>
<P1>57. The plaintiff and responding party respectfully submits that it is in the interest of justice for these powers to be exercised only at a trial. Wetzel has not presented sufficient evidence to support his argument of mischief, which would have to be &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo;, and therefore the application of <EM>ex turpia causa</EM>. In fact, the parties disagree about who owns the vehicles in question and ownership is a central component of the offence of mischief. Additionally, the parties disagree as to whether Wetzel fraudulently prepared the appraisals in question. Although the suggestion that the plaintiff might not own the vehicles in question is frivolous, and could be decided in the plaintiff's favour on motion, Wetzel's best case is that this, and whether he prepared fraudulent appraisals, are issues for trial.</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Rule 21.01(1)(a)</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>58. The plaintiff has not yet filed its Statement of Defence to Counterclaim as it is currently moving to strike paragraphs from the defendants' Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. Applying the current scenario to Rule 25.05, we may conclude that the pleadings have not yet closed.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 25.05(a).</P1>
<P1>59. The Courts have previously decided that it is not appropriate to move under Rule 21.1(1)(a) to decide a point of law until the pleadings have closed.</P1>

<P1>60. The Courts have decided that Rule 21.01(1)(a) is not designed to answer questions of law where no agreement exists on the material facts which underpin the question of law posed. The question of law posed by Wetzel centers around the federal criminal law offence of mischief and the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>. The plaintiff and responding party disputes facts that are required to conclude that the plaintiff committed an act of mischief. Given the disagreement on material facts as between the parties to this motion, such as ownership of the vehicle, the Court should not invoke Rule 21.01(1)(a) to decide a question of law on this motion.</P1>

<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Rule 21.01(1)(b)</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>61. Wetzel has not attacked any one specific paragraph of the plaintiffs Statement of Claim. The relief being sought is to dismiss and/or strike, either in whole or in part, the plaintiff's claim.</P1>
<P1>62. The plain and obvious test established by the Courts is a very high bar to meet. The plaintiff and responding party submits that the pleadings do not make it plain and obvious that the claim will not be able to succeed.</P1>
<P1>63. The plaintiff's Statement of Claim properly sets out the fraudulent acts of the defendants. Distilled down to its roots, the claim is a very simple one. The plaintiff attempted to have it's damaged property repaired for a fair price. If it had been, there would be no claim. Instead, the plaintiff discovered a series of fraudulent events associated with the appraisals and repair of its property. While there may be some disagreement over the facts pleaded, these disagreements do not satisfy the plain and obvious test. On the contrary, they cry out for a trial. Given the existence of video evidence, and independent expert appraisals, there is most definitely a reasonable prospect that the plaintiff will succeed with its claim.</P1>
<P1>64. The plaintiff and responding party submits that Wetzel has only indirectly addressed the allegations of fraud made in the plaintiffs Statement of Claim. In doing so, the moving party has put forth and relied upon federal criminal law, and the rare doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>. These are novel and arguably improper arguments being made in a civil fraud context. The defendants' reliance on novel concepts further indicates that the plain and obvious test has not been satisfied.</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Rule 21.01(3)(d)</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>65. The high bar of the plain and obvious test also applies to Rule 21.01(3)(d). In the case at bar, the plaintiff has asserted a proper cause of action. The evidence surrounding the claim should not be used to foreclose the action at this stage.</P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Piercing the Corporate Veil</EM></TI>
<P><P1>66. The plaintiff and responding party respectfully submits that the moving party's reliance on the argument of piercing the corporate veil is misplaced in law. In order to have the corporate veil pierced, a corporation must first be attempting to hold up the veil. In the case at hand, the plaintiff has openly held that its numbered corporation was an authorized agent of and solely controlled by its members.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Responding Motion Record, Affidavit of Douglas Dunstan at paras 9 and 10<BOLD>.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> Supplementary Motion Record at Tab 8.</P1>
<P1>67. In support of the moving party's legal analysis on piercing the corporate veil, they cite the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corp.</SOC></CASEREF> The case was unique in the sense that the appellants appeared in our Courts due to their inability to enforce their judgment in the United States. Specifically, they appeared in Canadian Courts in an attempt to pierce the corporate veil of Chevron Canada to collect from Chevron Corporation in the United States. In deciding to uphold the corporate separation between Chevron Corp. and Chevron Canada, the Court found that Chevron Canada was incorporated over 50 years ago. There was no allegation of wrongdoing on the part of Chevron Canada and the appellants specifically plead that Chevron Canada had not engaged in any inappropriate conduct. This case is irrelevant in the current context. No authority exists for the proposition that a stranger to a corporation can insist on maintaining a corporate veil when the corporation itself does not rely on it (in this case, to prove ownership of 2 cars).</P1>

<P1>Tab 14 of the plaintiffs Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>68. Any potential irregularity that existed in the contracts of insurance in place on the subject automobiles has no bearing on the case at hand. For example, if a complete wreck was towed from a dump yard to the defendant's body shop and it was fraudulently repaired and appraised without any insurance at all, there would be a valid claim for fraud. As a further example, if the vehicles did not have a valid policy of automobile insurance and they were appraised and repaired fraudulently, there would still be a valid claim for the fraud regardless of the invalidity of the insurance in place. None of the defendants are party to an automobile insurance contract with the plaintiff, nor is any party claiming under one. The defendants therefore have no standing to even raise the (automobile) insurance coverage issue.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Piercing the Corporate Veil Arguments as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P><P1>69. Wetzel has attempted to tie the argument of piercing the corporate veil into the clear evidentiary issue of ownership. The plaintiff and moving party disagrees with the analysis, questions its applicability and respectfully submits that the argument does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 20, 21.01(1)(a), 21.01(1)(b) or 21.01(3)(d).</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>C.</EM></N><TI><EM>Aviva's Payout Under Known fraudulent Conditions</EM></TI>
<P><P1>70. The plaintiff and responding party respectfully submits that the case at hand is a civil tort/contract case involving the plaintiff making allegations of fraudulent behaviour as against the defendants. Analysis of contracts that the plaintiff or its numbered company was a party to is not relevant to the core issue of the claim for one overlying reason. The defendants are not privy to any of those contracts.</P1>
<P1>71. Wetzel cites section 233(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> in paragraph twenty-six (26) of his moving factum. That section is specifically designed to protect insurance companies against fraud. In order for that section to apply, it is the insurance company, who is privy to the contract between itself and the insured, who must invoke that section. The Supreme Court of Canada outlined the two exceptions to the doctrine of privity in its decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Fraser River Pile &amp; Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> Justice Iacobucci provided two factors to consider:</P1>
<P1>(a) did the parties to the contract intend to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision'; and (b) Are the activities performed by the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision the very activities contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general, or the provision in particular, again as determined by reference to the intentions of the parties'</P1>
<P1>In the case at hand, the clear answer to these exceptions is no, the defendants were never contemplated as third parties to the contracts (auto insurance policies).</P1>

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Aviva's Payout Under Known Fraudulent Conditions as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P><P1>72. There is no legal foundation to this argument. Section 233 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> was created to protect insurance companies against instances of fraud. It would be up to the insurance company to invoke this section of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> and it may not be relied upon by parties who are not privy to the contract. Even if there was an instance of insurance fraud, which the plaintiff and responding party does not agree with, it would be up to the insurance company to activate its rights under the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>73. Given the lack of legal foundation attached to the moving party's provincial insurance law arguments, they cannot be used to invoke the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> that are being relied upon.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Mitigation</EM></TI>
<P><P1>74. The concept of mitigation has no application in the current context. The moving party cites a decision that discusses steps that should be taken to mitigate the loss. This argument is circular as mitigation needs to occur after a loss. The loss being claimed in this instance is the damages that were suffered by way of the defendants' fraudulent actions. The plaintiff had no way of mitigating these losses until they occurred.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Mitigation Argument as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P><P1>75. The moving party's mitigation argument does not relate to any of the Rules upon which it relies. As such, the responding party will not conduct a detailed analysis on each individual rule.</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>D.</EM></N><TI><EM>Aviva's Abuse of the Process of the Court</EM></TI>
<P><P1>76. The relevant Rule to support an argument under this heading is 21.01(3)(d). The high bar of the plain and obvious test applies to this rule. The Courts analysis has largely rested on whether or not a plaintiff has asserted a proper cause of action.</P1>

<P1>Tab 10 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>77. The moving party cites the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E. Local 79</SOC></CASEREF> in support of its abuse of process argument. This decision veers from the relevant Rule 21.01(3)(d) as its analysis of a Judges power to prevent abuse of process is centered around the issue of relitigation of a criminal conviction.</P1>

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Aviva's Abuse of the Process of the Court Argument as Applied to the Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></TI>
<P><P1>78. The applicable test to prove an abuse of process under Rule 21.01(3)(d) is the plain and obvious test. In the case at bar, the plaintiff has asserted a proper cause of action. The Court should not foreclose the action on these grounds.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Oppression Arguments</EM></TI>
<P><P1>79. The moving party alleges that the plaintiff's claim for investigative costs is oppressive in nature. The plaintiff and moving party respectfully submits that this is not the proper forum to litigate the appropriate amount of damages claimed. This argument does not relate to any of the Rules being relied upon in the moving party's motion. Furthermore, the moving party has not been able to point to any authority to prove that the plaintiffs claim is oppressive and thus contrary to a proper pleading. The moving party only applies policy reasons that have been formulated to act in favour of Wetzel in what is a very niche fact scenario.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Civil Entrapment</EM></TI>
<P><P1>80. This allegation does not invoke any of the Rules being relied upon by the moving party. Additionally, there is no authority cited to support the existence of the concept of &ldquo;civil entrapment.&rdquo; Even if civil entrapment was recognized by the Court, which the plaintiff and responding party submits that it has not been, the moving party mischaracterized the elements of entrapment.</P1>
<P1>81. The leading decision on entrapment is <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Mack</SOC></CASEREF>. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized entrapment when: (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to persons to commit an offence without reasonable suspicion or acting mala fides; or (b) having a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they [the authorities] go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Mack</SOC><CITE>[1988] 2 S.C.R. 903</CITE><PARANUM>115</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 17 of the plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>82. The case law clearly confines the concept of entrapment to law enforcement authorities. Secondly, even if the Court were to extend this principle into a civil concept, the accused party would need to <EM>go beyond providing an opportunity</EM> and would actually need to induce the commission of the offence. The moving party's factum, at paragraph thirty-one (31) only speaks to the opportunity to commit wrongdoing.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Fraud Arguments</EM></TI>
<P><P1>83. Paragraph thirty-two (32) of the Wetzel defendant's factum argues that Aviva's claim itself may be viewed as being fraudulent. Use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; immediately eliminates the use of Rule 20, as the allegation itself concedes that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial. The moving party's fraud arguments would also fail the plain and obvious test required under Rule 21.01.</P1>
<P1>84. The plaintiff and responding party further submits that this is not the proper forum to be making an allegation of fraud unrelated to the Rules being relied upon in the moving party's motion. Wetzel could have included the allegation of fraud in its counterclaim.</P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. A total of three motions are being brought concurrently. All of the parties involved in this action have brought motions. The Defendants 1843538 Ontario Inc. c.o.b. Mississauga Collision Centre, and/or McLaren Collision, Fady Warda and Rony Amanuel Warda (Collectively, &ldquo;the Warda Defendants&rdquo;) are moving under Rule 21.01(1)(a) and 21.01(1)(b) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. The Warda Defendants are seeking the following relief:
<P2>a) An Order, pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a), disposing of all, or part of this action, brought by Aviva Canada Inc. (&ldquo;the Plaintiff') as against the Warda Defendants;</P2>
<P2>b) Alternatively, an Order, pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(b), striking and/or dismissing Aviva's Statement of Claim on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or it is an abuse of the Court's process;</P2>
<P2>c) Costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity scale; and</P2>
<P2>d) Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P2></P1>
<P1>2. The Plaintiff and the Defendant Michael Wetzel (&ldquo;Wetzel&rdquo;) will also be arguing motions on the return date of March 28, 2019. All three motions were scheduled to be heard on the same date as per the Order of Justice Glustein dated October 12, 2018.</P1>
<P1>3. The Plaintiff is bringing a motion pursuant to Rules 21.01, 25.06 and 25.11 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> to strike paragraphs from both the Warda Defendants' and Wetzel Defendant's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>4. Wetzel is bringing a Summary Judgment Motion pursuant to Rule 20.01(3). Additionally and/or alternatively, Wetzel is moving pursuant to Rules 21.01(1)(a), 21.01(1)(b), and/or 21.01(3)(d) to strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiffs claim either in whole or in part on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P><P1>5. The statement of facts giving rise to the Warda Defendants' motion is identical to the statement of facts relied upon in the Plaintiff's Factum in support of its motion attacking the Defendants' pleadings. For ease of reference, these facts will be repeated from paragraphs 6 thru 8 herein.</P1>
<P1>6. By Statement of Claim issued on April 23, 2018, the Plaintiff commenced an action to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of duty of honest performance of a contract, unjust enrichment, and conspiracy to commit fraud. Additionally, the Plaintiff sought to recover damages for trespass to property, investigative costs and punitive and exemplary damages.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion&mdash;Aviva Canada Inc.'s Statement of Claim dated April 23, 2018.</P1>
<P1>7. Wetzel delivered his Statement of Defence and Counterclaim on July 16, 2018.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion&mdash;Wetzel Defendant's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>8. The Warda Defendants delivered their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim on October 15, 2018.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion&mdash;Warda Defendants' Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P><P1>9. <BOLD>Whether the Court should dispose of all or part of the action brought by the Plaintiff as against the Warda Defendants' pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a).</BOLD> The Plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that it would be improper to strike all or part of the action on these grounds.</P1>
<P1>10. <BOLD>Whether the Court should strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or it is an abuse of the Court's process pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(b).</BOLD> The Plaintiff and responding party to this motion respectfully submits that it has disclosed a reasonable cause of action. As such, it would be improper to strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim on these grounds.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;STATEMENT OF LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Rule 21.01(1)(a)</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>To Any Party on a Question of Law</EM></TI>
<P><P1>11. A complete analysis of Rule 21.01(1)(a) is also found in the Plaintiffs responding factum to the Wetzel Defendant's motion. This analysis occurs at paragraphs twenty-seven (27) thru thirty-one (31). For ease of reference, the law will be repeated below.</P1>
<P1>12. Rule 21.01(1)(a) allows a party to move before a judge for the determination, before trial, of a question of law raised by a pleading in an action where the determination of the question may dispose of all or part of the action, substantially shorten the trial or result in a substantial saving of costs.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 21.01(1)(a).</P1>
<P1>13. The Court in <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro</SOC></CASEREF> decided that the &ldquo;plain and obvious&rdquo; test is the relevant test for both subrules (a) and (b) of rule 21.01(1).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro</SOC><CITE>19 O.R. (3d) 529</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 1 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>14. In addition to the plain and obvious test, the Court has previously considered when it would be appropriate to bring a motion to dispose of a point of law. In <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. CanadianBroadcasting Corp. et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Lieff, commented on what was then Rule 124, which allowed for a point of law to be set down for a hearing at any time before the trial. Justice Lieff decided that the defendant's proper procedure is to bring a motion for a judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings are complete. This principle was later adopted by the Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. CanadianBroadcasting Corp. et al.</SOC><YEAR>1975</YEAR><CITE>8 O.R. (2d) 55</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>

<P1>Tab 3 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>15. According to Rule 25.05 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, Pleadings in an action are closed when, (a) the plaintiff has delivered a reply to every defence in the action or the time for delivery of a reply has expired.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 25.05(a).</P1>
<P1>16. In <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. (Liquidator of) v. CUMIS General Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, D.M. Brown J., conducted an analysis of the relevant case law related to Rule 21.01(1)(a) motions. The following general principles were extracted from the case law:
<P2>i. the rule is not designed to answer questions of law where material facts are in dispute or, put another way, where no agreement exists on the material facts which underpin the question of law posed;</P2>
<P2>ii. a party should not use Rule 21 to secure the advice of the court about the soundness of its cause of action or defence by asking the court to assume that the material facts it has pleaded will be proved at trial, thereby asking the court to answer a hypothetical question. However, the hypothetical to be avoided is one where an underpinning of the legal determination sought under Rule 21 might be altered at trial, and the legal determination thus rendered redundant;</P2>
<P2>iii. a defendant should not move for the determination of a question of law involving the applicability of a limitation period...;</P2>
<P2>iv. where the question of law depends on the construction of a contract, the terms of which are unclear and capable of more than one meaning, Rule 21 is not an appropriate device to use to anshwer the question; and</P2>
<P2>v. matters of law which have not been settled fully in the jurisprudence usually should not be disposed of at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. (Liquidator of) v. CUMIS General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 6107</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2>
<P2>Tab 4 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Mischief Allegations</EM></TI>
<P><P1>17. The Warda Defendants make allegations of the Criminal Code Offence of Mischief, citing Section 430(1) of the Criminal Code.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 430(1).</P1>
<P1>18. In doing so, the Warda Defendants ignore Section 429 (3) of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM>, which considers the effect of having interest in property that is destroyed or damaged. Specifically, the section stipulates that: (a) the fact that a person has a partial interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage; and (b) the fact that a person has total interest in what is destroyed or damaged does not prevent him from being guilty of the offence if he caused the destruction or damage with the intent to defraud.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 429(3).</P1>
<P1>19. In the case at hand, the Plaintiff states in its Statement of Claim that it was the owner of the damaged property. As such, according to Section 429(3) of the <EM>Criminal Code</EM>, for mischief to have occurred, the plaintiff must have had the intention of defrauding the defendant.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Criminal Code</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. C-46), Section 429(3).</P1>
<P1>20. The issue of law to be decided based on the allegations of mischief is the applicability of the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>. In the Supreme Court of Canada's decision of <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE></CASEREF>, Justice Rothstein revisited and summarized the leading case on <EM>ex turpi causa in</EM> Canada, <EM>Hall v. Hebert</EM> [1993] S.C.J. No 51, into six (6) principles. The first (1) principle is an understanding that an application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine in the tort context invalidates otherwise valid and enforceable actions in tort. The second (2) principle attempts to recognize the grave consequences of applying the doctrine and cautions that it should only be used &ldquo;in very limited circumstances.&rdquo; The third (3) principle states that the only justification for the application of the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is the preservation of the integrity of the legal system. The fourth (4) principle states that the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine generally does not preclude an award of damages in tort because such awards tend to compensate the plaintiff rather than amount to profit. Finally, principles five (5) and six (6), states that the <EM>ex turpi</EM> doctrine is a defence in a tort action; as a defence, the onus is on the defendant to prove the illegal or immoral conduct that precludes the plaintiff's action.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Columbia v. Zastowny</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 6 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Insurance Act Allegations</EM></TI>
<P><P1>21. The Warda Defendants allege that the Plaintiff violated Section 118 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. Section 118 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> comments on how the violation of law can have an effect on a claim for indemnity. The dispute at hand is not a claim for indemnity under an insurance policy. The section has nothing to do with the issues in this action.</P1>
<P1>22. The Warda Defendants cite the case of <CASEREF><SOC>TD General Insurance Co. and Madinei, Re</SOC></CASEREF> at Paragraph 18 of their factum. This decision of a Financial Services Commission of Ontario arbitrator, on appeal from another FSCO arbitrator, seems to be cited as authority for the principle that the facts of the present case are akin to an insured damaging his or her own vehicle to make a fraudulent accident benefits claim, and, in contradiction to the Warda Defendants case, that insurers can seek repayment of any monies paid out for damages on the basis of fraudulent accident claims. The Plaintiff respectfully submits that the <EM>TD</EM> decision is of no assistance. It is a FSCO decision that dealt with the repayment of statutory accident benefits following a staged collision (by the insured). It does not speak to misrepresentation and fraud outside of the context of statutory accident benefits, which concerns a contract between the insured and the benefits carrier. It also deals specifically and exclusively with fraud by an insured person. As pleaded, this lawsuit is not about insurance or an insurance policy of any kind, nor are any of the parties to the lawsuit insured persons in respect of any of the issues in the lawsuit.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>TD General Insurance Co. and Madinei, Re</SOC><CITE>[2018] O.F.S.C.D. No 114</CITE><PARANUM>2</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>

<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Application of Rule 21.01(1)(a) to the Case at Bar</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>23. The Defendants have each filed a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim. The Plaintiff is currently moving to strike paragraphs from those pleadings. As such, the Plaintiff has not yet filed its own Statement of Defence to the Counterclaim. Applying the current scenario to Rule 25.05, we may conclude that pleadings have not yet closed.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r. 25.05(a).</P1>
<P1>24. The Courts have previously decided that it is not appropriate to move under Rule 21.01(1)(a) to decide a point of law until the pleadings have closed.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Plasmapheresis Centres Ltd. v. CanadianBroadcasting Corp. et al.</SOC><YEAR>1975</YEAR><CITE>8 O.R. (2d) 55</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>

<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</SOC><CITE>[1992] O.J. No. 1274</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 3 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>25. The Courts have decided that Rule 21.01(1)(a) is not designed to answer questions of law where no agreement exists on the material facts which underpin the question of law posed. The question of law posed by the Warda Defendants as moving party centers around the federal criminal law offence of mischief, the doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> and provincial insurance law. The Plaintiff and responding party disputes facts that are required to conclude that the Plaintiff committed an act of mischief; and to conclude that the Plaintiff violated provincial insurance law. Given the disagreement on material facts as between the parties to this motion, such as ownership of the vehicle and the applicability of Section 118 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, the Court should not invoke Rule 21.01(1)(a) to decide a question of law on this motion.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Portuguese Canadian Credit Union Ltd. (Liquidator of) v. CUMIS General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 6107</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 4 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Rule 21.01(1)(b)</EM></TI>
<P><P1>26. As was the case with Rule 21.01(1)(a), the Plaintiff provided the Court with a full analysis of Rule 21.01(1)(b) in its responding factum to the Wetzel Defendant's motion. This analysis is found at paragraphs thirty-three (33) thru thirty-eight (38). For ease of reference, the law will be repeated below.</P1>
<P1>27. Rule 21.01(1)(b) allows for a pleading to be struck on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01(1)(b).</P1>
<P1>28. Rule 21.01(2) stipulates that no evidence is admissible on a motion under 21.01(1)(b).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01(2).</P1>
<P1>29. The test that is applied to determine whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action or defence is the &ldquo;plain and obvious test.&rdquo; The moving party must show that it is plain, obvious and beyond doubt that the respondent could not succeed in the claim or defence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 8 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>30. The power of the Court to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is a valuable housekeeping measure that is essential to effective and fair litigation. By properly exercising the power to strike, the Court can unclutter the proceeding and weed out the hopeless claims. This ensures that only those claims that have some chance of success go on to a trial.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 8 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>31. A motion to strike for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence proceeds on the basis that the facts pleaded are true, unless they are manifestly incapable of being proven. Additionally, no evidence is permissible on such a motion.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>Tab 8 of the Plaintiff's Book of Authorities</P1>
<P1>32. Whether the evidence substantiates the pleaded facts, now or at some future date, is irrelevant to the motion to strike. The judge on the motion to strike cannot consider what evidence adduced in the future might or might not show. To require the judge to do so would be to gut the motion to strike of its logic and ultimately render it useless.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2011] S.C.J. No. 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2011 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1>

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Application of Rule 21.01(1)(b) to the Case at Bar</UNDER></TI>
<P><P1>33. The Warda Defendants, as moving party, have not attacked any one specific paragraph of the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim. The relief being sought under 21.01(1)(b) is to strike and/or dismiss the Plaintiff's entire claim on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or is an abuse of the Court's process.</P1>
<P1>34. The Plaintiff and responding party agrees that 21.01(1)(b) is the proper rule to move under to strike out a pleading. However, Rule 21.01(1)(b) is not the proper avenue to seek relief for an action being an abuse of the Court's process.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990 194 r 21.01.</P1>
<P1>35. The plain and obvious test established by the Courts is a very high bar to meet. The responding party submits that the pleadings do not make it plain and obvious that its claim will not be able to succeed.</P1>
<P1>36. In the case at bar, the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim properly sets out the fraudulent acts of the defendants. Distilled down to its roots, the claim is a very simple one. The Plaintiff attempted to have it's damaged property repaired for a fair price. If it had been, there would be no claim. Instead, the Plaintiff discovered a series of fraudulent events associated with the appraisals and repair of its property. While there may be some disagreement over the facts pleaded, such as the ownership of the vehicle, these disagreements do not satisfy the plain and obvious test. On the contrary, they cry out for a trial. Given the existence of video evidence, and independent expert appraisals, there is most definitely a reasonable prospect that the plaintiff will succeed with its claim.</P1>
<P1>37. The Plaintiff and responding party submits that the moving Warda Defendants have only indirectly addressed the allegations of fraud made in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim. In doing so, the moving parties have put forth and relied upon federal criminal law, the rare doctrine of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> and provincial insurance law. These are novel and arguably improper arguments being made in a civil fraud context. The Defendants' reliance on novel concepts further indicates that the plain and obvious test has not been satisfied.</P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
