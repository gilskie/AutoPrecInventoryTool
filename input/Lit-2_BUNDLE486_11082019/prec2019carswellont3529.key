<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF JENELLE WESTWORTH</TI>
<P>I, Jenelle Westworth, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a Lawyer with the law firm of BLACK, SUTHERLAND LLP<BOLD>,</BOLD> the lawyers for the Applicant, Traders General Insurance Company, and, as such, have knowledge of the matters contained in this affidavit.</P>
<P>2. The matters deposed to in this affidavit are within my knowledge unless otherwise stated. The matters deposed to that are not within my knowledge have been derived from third parties or a review of documents and, in each of such cases, the source of the information is identified and I verily believe such matters to be true. True copies of all exhibits referred to herein are attached and tabbed accordingly.</P>
<P>3. At all material times, the Respondent, Elizabeth Gibson (&ldquo;Ms. Gibson Senior&rdquo;), was insured pursuant to a homeowners policy of insurance issued by the Applicant, Traders General Insurance Company (&ldquo;Traders&rdquo;), under policy number XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) in relation to her home located at XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Premises&rdquo;). Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the relevant renewal of the Policy, including the policy wordings.</P>
<P>4. A review of the Policy indicates it included Personal Liability Protection coverage which covered the insured for &ldquo;all sums which you become legally liable to pay as compensatory damages because of unintentional bodily injury or property damages arising out of: 1) your personal actions anywhere in the world; 2) your ownership, use or occupancy of the premises defined in Section II&rdquo;.</P>
<P>5. That aforementioned coverage was limited by a number of exclusions, including an exclusion for claims arising from &ldquo;bodily injury to you or to any person residing in your household other than a residence employee&rdquo;.</P>
<P>6. A review of our file indicates on March 31, 2014, the Respondent's daughter, Elizabeth Thompson Gibson (&ldquo;Ms. Gibson Junior&rdquo;), fell off the porch on the Premises as a result of the failure of a railing attached to the porch (the &ldquo;Accident&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. Ms. Gibson Junior commenced an action in Superior Court under court file number CV-14-507726 with respect to alleged bodily injury she sustained in the Accident (the &ldquo;Underlying Action&rdquo;). The Underlying Action names several Defendants, including an individual contractor and contracting company which conducted renovations on the porch of the Premises, the owner of an abutting home and Ms. Gibson Senior. Attached at <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD> to the within Application Record is a copy of the Statement of Claim in the Underlying Action.</P>
<P>8. Each of the Defendants in the Underlying Action has entered a Statement of Defence and Crossclaim, including Ms. Gibson Senior. Attached at <BOLD>Tab 4</BOLD> is the Statement of Defence and Crossclaim of Ms. Gibson Senior in the Underlying Action.</P>
<P>9. A review of our file indicates examinations for discovery in the Underlying Action have been completed.</P>
<P>10. Unfortunately, Ms. Gibson Junior passed away following examinations for discovery. Plaintiff's counsel in the Underlying Action has obtained an Order to Continue. Attached at <BOLD>Tab 5</BOLD> is the Order to Continue in the Underlying Action.</P>
<P>11. On November 14, 2016, my office advised counsel of our intention to pursue this Application and requesting the transcripts from the examinations for discovery of Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the letter of November 14, 2016.</P>
<P>12. By way of letter dated November 15, 2016, Ms. Gibson Junior's counsel in the Underlying Action provided my office with copies of the transcripts from the examinations for discovery of Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior in the Underlying Action. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the letter of November 15, 2016. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit are true copies of the transcripts of the examinations for discovery of Ms. Gibson Junior and Ms. Gibson Senior, respectively, as provided to my office by Ms. Gibson Junior's counsel in the Underlying Action.</P>
<P>13. By way of letter dated January 19, 2018, my office confirmed our intention to use the transcripts from the examinations for discovery of Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior for the purposes of the within Application. My office requested consent to use these transcripts for the purposes of the within Application. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the correspondence of January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>14. As of the date of the swearing of this Affidavit, a review of our file indicates we have not received a response from any party to the Underlying Action in regards to our intention to use the transcripts for the purposes of this Application.</P>
<P>15. Given her unfortunate passing, I verily believe the only sworn evidence of Ms. Gibson Junior to be tendered at the trial of the Underlying Action is her sworn examination for discovery evidence.</P>
<P>16. I verily believe no prejudice will accrue to Ms. Gibson Senior nor Ms. Gibson Junior arising from the use of their examination for discovery transcripts for the purposes of the within Application.</P>
<P>17. A review of the sworn examination for discovery evidence of Ms. Gibson Junior indicates the following:
<ITEM><P>As of the time of discovery, Ms. Gibson Junior had lived at the Premises continuously with Ms. Gibson Senior for 62 years (since she was about 4 years old), with the exception of a 10 month period in the 1970s (Questions 17&ndash;21).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She had not worked since 1996 and was on long-term disability (Questions 25-26).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Prior to the Accident, Ms. Gibson Junior would vacuum and dust the entire home; described as 2 storeys plus a basement, including 3 bedrooms, 1 washroom, a kitchen and 2 additional rooms on the first floor (Questions 145, 149&ndash;153, 176&ndash;179).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Junior had the home painted in about 2011, and also painted and wallpapered the kitchen herself in the past (Questions 158-159).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She and Ms. Gibson Senior would garden together and take turns mowing the lawn on the Premises prior to the Accident (Questions 181 and 188).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She and Ms. Gibson Senior would take turns putting their collective laundry in the wash and would hang their clothes to dry together (Questions 181, 182 and 204).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Prior to the accident, Ms. Gibson Junior and her mother would do the grocery shopping together (Questions 218&ndash;223).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Junior and Ms. Gibson Senior ate meals together as a family; both would cook prior to the Accident (Questions 238&ndash;242).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Junior was paying her mother $400/month in rent at the time of the Accident, but there was no signed tenancy agreement. She began pay ing rent when she began working (Questions 248&ndash;251).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>On a typical day, Ms. Gibson Junior and her mother would both participate in housework (Questions 287&ndash;289).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Senior would make tea, crackers and cheese for Ms. Gibson Junior and her friend when her friend visited about every 2 weeks (Questions 326-372).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The two shared a washroom and had made modifications to the washroom to benefit both of them; including putting bars on the walls and installing a lowering mechanism (Questions 675&ndash;680).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>They shared household expenses, although Ms. Gibson Senior contributed more towards same. Ms. Gibson Senior assumed things like utilities and property tax (Questions 690-691).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Senior was assisted Ms. Gibson Junior with making her bed (Question 692).</P></ITEM></P>
<P>18. A review of the sworn examination for discovery evidence of Ms. Gibson Senior indicates the following:
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Junior had a son, Ms. Gibson Senior's grandson, who was 29 years old at the time of the examination for discoveries, and who had lived with M s. Gibson Junior and Ms. Gibson Senior until about 3 years prior to the Accident (Questions 25&ndash;30).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Senior's husband lived in the Premises with her and Ms. Gibson Junior until he passed away in XXXXXXXXXX (Questions 370-371).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>On the date of the Accident, Ms. Gibson Senior stated she and her daughter had a medical appointment with her daughter's doctor (Questions 272 and 276).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Ms. Gibson Junior had ordered a side railing for the Premises prior to the Accident (Question 424).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>It was Ms. Gibson Junior who hired someone to replace the front porch railing at the Premises after the Accident and paid for same (Questions 429&ndash;431 and 433).</P></ITEM></P>
<P>19. Based on my review of our file, I verily believe Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior were residing in the same household on the date of the Accident.</P>
<P>20. I swear this Affidavit in support of the within Application and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICANT'S FACTUM</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Applicant, Traders General Insurance Company (&ldquo;Traders&rdquo;), bring this Application for a declaration that it is not required to indemnify the Respondent, Elizabeth Gibson Senior (&ldquo;Ms. Gibson Senior&rdquo;), under a homeowners p olicy of insurance issued by Traders bearing policy number XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;), in relation to any amounts Ms. Gibson Senior may be found liable to pay pursuant to the legal action commenced against her by her daughter, Elizabeth Thompson Gibson (&ldquo;Ms. Gibson Junior&ldquo;), under court file number CV-14-507726 (the &ldquo;Underlying Action&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. The Underlying Action arises from an accident which occurred at the home owned by Ms. Gibson Senior and occupied by both herself and her daughter, Ms. Gibson Junior. Ms. Gibson Junior sustained bodily injury in the accident. Ms. Gibson Junior has unfortunately passed away since commencing the action, although after her examination for discovery was completed. An Order to continue has been obtained.</P>
<P>3. The Policy explicitly excludes coverage for claims arising from &ldquo;bodily injury to you or any person residing in your household&rdquo;.</P>
<P>4. Based on the evidence available it is abundantly clear that Ms. Gibson Junior was residing in Ms. Gibson Senior's household on the date of the Accident. They had lived together in the residence as mother and daughter for 61 years at the time and were intimately involved in each other's lives and contributed towards the same household in terms of housekeeping tasks, expenses and social activities.</P>
<P>5. Thus, it is Traders' position that Ms. Gibson Junior was a person residing in Ms. Gibson Senior's household at the time of the loss and, accordingly, the claim arising from Ms. Gibson Junior's bodily injury is excluded from coverage.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>6. At all material times, Ms. Gibson Senior was insured pursuant to the Policy, issued by Traders, with respect to Ms. Gibson Senior's home, located at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX (the&rdquo;Premise&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD><EM>Traders General Insurance Company policy number XXXXXXXXXX found in the Affidavit of Jenelle Westworth, sworn February 27, 2018, Application Record, Tab 2 (&ldquo;Westworth Affidavit&rdquo;) at Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. The Policy Provided Ms. Gibson Senior with Personal Liability Protection as follows:
<QUOTE><P>We will pay all sums which you become legally liable to pay as compensatory damages because of unintentional bodily injury or property damages arising out of:
<P1>1. your personal actions anywhere in the world;</P1>
<P1>2. your ownership, use or occupancy of the premises defined in Section II.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Traders General Insurance Company policy number XXXXXXXXXX, found in Westworth Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. However, the above noted coverage was subject to a number of exclusions, including the following:
<QUOTE><P>We do not insure claims made against you arising from:</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>5. bodily injury to you or to any person residing in your household other than a residence employee;</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Traders General Insurance Company policy number XXXXXXXXXX. Section II, Coverage E&mdash;Your Personal Liability Protection, found in Westworth Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. On March 31, 2014, Ms. Gibson Junior fell from the porch on the property owned by Ms. Gibson Senior located at XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Premises&rdquo;), when the railing attached to the porch failed (the &ldquo;Accident&rdquo;). Ms. Gibson Junior alleges she sustained serious personal injuries in the Accident.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Statement of Claim in court file number CV-14-507726, Application Record, Tab A (&ldquo;Statement of Claim&rdquo;)</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. Ms. Gibson Junior commenced an action as a result of the Accident against a number of parties, including an individual contractor and contracting company which conducted renovations on the porch of the Premises, the owner of an abutting home and Ms. Gibson Senior.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Statement of Claim</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES, LAW &amp; AUTHORITIES</TI>
<P>14. The Applicant submits that the following issues are to be decided by this Honourable Court:
<P1>(a) Should Traders be allowed to rely on the examination for discovery evidence of Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior for the purposes of this Application?</P1>
<P1>(b) Was Ms. Gibson Junior a person residing in Ms. Gibson Senior's household at the time of the Accident?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;LAW &amp; AUTHORITIES</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Deemed Undertaking</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>15. The relevant portions of Rule 30.1.01 (1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure read as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>30.1.01</N>
<SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>This Rule applies to,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>evidence obtained under, ...
<SPARA><N>(ii)</N><SPARAP>Rule 31 (examination for discovery) ...</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(3)</N><SSECP>All parties and their lawyers are deemed to undertake not to use evidence or information to which this Rule applies for any purposes other than those of the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(4)</N><SSECP>Subrule (3) does not prohibit a use to which the person who disclosed the evidence consents. ...</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(6)</N><SSECP>Subrule (3) does not prohibit the use of evidence obtained in one proceeding, or information obtained from such evidence, to impeach the testimony of a witness in another proceeding. ...</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(8)</N><SSECP>If satisfied that the interest of justice outweighs any prejudice that would result to a party who disclosed evidence, the court may order that subrule (3) does not apply to the evidence or to information obtained from it, and may impose such terms and give such directions as are just.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O 1990, Reg. 194, Rule 30.1.01, Book of Authorities of the Applicant (&ldquo;BOA&rdquo;), Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. Traders submits both Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior, through their counsel in the Underlying Action have been aware of Traders' intention to use the transcripts from the examinations for discovery in the Underlying Action and have not voiced any concerns related to same. In fact, the transcripts from the Examinations for Discovery of Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior were provided to Traders by Ms. Gibson Junior's counsel.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Westworth Affidavit at paragraph 11, 12 and 13</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. In <CASEREF><SOC>Livent v. Drabinsky et al.</SOC></CASEREF> the courts considered and confirmed the right of a non-party to seek waiver of the Deemed Undertaking Rule, although in <EM>Livent</EM>, the evidence sought to be adduced by the non-party had not already been disclosed to the non-party.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Livent v. Drabinsky et al.</SOC><CITE>53 O.R. (3d) 126</CITE><PARANUM>12&ndash;14</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The present case differs in that Ms. Gibson Junior willingly provided Traders with the discovery transcripts and neither Ms. Gibson Senior nor Ms. Gibson Junior has objected to the use of these transcripts.</P>
<P>19. The Supreme Court of Canada has formulated a test applicable to relief from the Deemed Undertaking rule:
<QUOTE><P>If satisfied that the interest of justice outweights any prejudice that would result to the party who disclosed evidence, the court may order that [the implied or &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; undertaking] does not apply to the evidence or to information obtained from it, and may impose such terms and give such directions as are just.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Juman v. Doucette</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 157</CITE><PARANUM>34</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. Moreover, in considering the Deemed Undertaking Rule, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that where discovery material in one action is sought to be used in another action with the same or similar parties and the same or similar issues, the prejudice to the examinee is virtually non-existent and leave will generally be granted.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Juman</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paragraph 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The present Application arises due to the Underlying Action. The Respondent is a Defendant in that action. The issues certainly overlap; namely, consideration of the living arrangements as between Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior.</P>
<P>22. Thus, it is submitted there is no prejudice to Ms. Gibson Senior or Ms. Gibson Junior arising from the use of the examination for discovery transcripts on this Application.</P>
<P>23. Specifically, in relation to Ms. Gibson Junior, Traders submits that due to her unfortunate passing, Ms. Gibson Junior's sworn examination for discovery evidence will be the only evidence available from her at trial. As such, the transcripts in question will ultimately be filed with the court for the hearing of the trial, which would bring them outside the deemed undertaking rule.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, Rule 30.1.01(5).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. Moreover, Ms. Gibson Junior's examination for discovery transcript is Traders' only way of obtaining her evidence on issues pertaining to her living circumstances at the time of the Accident, which is the primary issue on this Application. It is not possible to examine her as a non-party to this proceeding.</P>
<P>25. While Ms. Gibson Senior has yet to tender evidence for the purposes of the Application, Traders submits any such evidence, to the extent it is inconsistent with her examination for discovery evidence, would be subject to Rule 30.1.01(6).</P>
<P>26. One of the policy reasons behind the conclusion that relief from the Deemed Undertaking Rule ought to be granted with respect to discovery evidence in related actions is to prevent inconsistent evidence, or allowing a person to tailor his or her evidence to suit his or her needs in each particular proceeding.</P>
<P>27. This concern is outlined in <CASEREF><SOC>Antongiovanni v. Phung</SOC></CASEREF>, where the court ordered productions of transcripts from examinations in accident benefits and long-term disability actions for use in a related tort action:
<QUOTE><P>In my opinion prior testimony under oath in another proceeding by the same person who is a party to the current action, and which involves the same factual underpinning, namely the same accident and the same injuries, is precisely the kind of evidence to which rule 30.1.01(6) is directed. The Plaintiff cannot be heard to complain of prejudice if she is impeached by her own testimony under oath. If I do not order production of the transcripts, the evidence will not be available for impeachment.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Antongiovanni v. Phung</SOC><CITE>[2001] O.J. No. 4659</CITE><PARANUM>73</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. In sum, Traders submits there is no prejudice to Ms. Gibson Senior or Ms. Gibson Junior arising from use of their examination for discovery transcripts in the Underlying Action on this Application. Moreover, without this evidence, the court will be unable to properly assess the matters at issue in this Application, particularly in light of Ms. Gibson Junior's unfortunate passing.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Duty to Indemnify</EM></TI>
<P>29. The duty to indemnify is independent of, and narrower than, the duty to defend. While the latter is assessed by reference to the pleadings, the duty to indemnify is assessed by reference to the facts.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Broadhurst &amp; Ball and Allport v. American Home Assurance Co., Guardian Assurance Co. of Canada and Gestas Inc.</SOC><CITE>1 O.R. (3D) 225</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at page 5, BOA, Tab 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. The relief sought by Traders on this Application is with respect to its duty to indemnify. In cases where the facts underpinning a coverage issue are available prior to a determination of the underlying action, a declaration coverage, or lack thereof, need to not wait until a determination in the underlying action.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Broadhurst &amp; Ball and Allport</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at page 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. In this case, there is sufficient evidence available to make a determination as to the duty to indemnity at this juncture given the evidence available. More notably, the sworn examination for discovery evidence of Ms. Gibson Junior which, given her unfortunate passing, will be her only sworn evidence available for the Trial of the Underlying Action. Moreover, a determination of liability in the Underlying Action will not provide answers as to whether Ms. Gibson Junior was residing in her mother's household at the time of the Accident.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>General Principles of Insurance Policy Interpretation</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>32. Insurance policy exclusions should be considered in the context of the policy as a whole.</P>
<P>33. The Supreme Court of Canada has set out general principles of interpretation to consider when determining whether an event falls within coverage of a particular policy. These general principles were articulated in <CASEREF><SOC>Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Limited v. Simcoe Erie General Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF> as including the following:
<P1>(a) the contra proferentum rule;</P1>
<P1>(b) the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the desirability, at least where the policy is ambiguous, of giving effect to the reasonable expectation of the parties.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Limited v. Simco &amp; Erie General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1993] 1 S.C.R. 252</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Court must also attempt to ascertain the purpose of the clause in issue, to the extent that it can be obtained from the wording of the policy.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company v. Bell</SOC><CITE>[1957] S.C.R. 581</CITE><PAGENUM>at 583</PAGENUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. The purpose of the exclusion in question has been previously considered and found to be prevention of claims between the named insured and family members &ldquo;residing in the household&rdquo;. The reason behind the exclusion being to prevent the potential for collusive claims being advance by such indiv iduals.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Canada Inc. v. Yaehne</SOC><CITE>[2005] S.J. No. 822</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 8.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Appel (Public Trustee of) v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1997] B.C.J. No. 1794</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, BOA, Tab 9.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>&ldquo;Residing in your Household&rdquo;</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>36. The exclusion in question requires a consideration of the meaning of &ldquo;residing&rdquo; and &ldquo;household&rdquo;.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>&ldquo;Residing&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P>37. Black's Law Dictionary defines &ldquo;reside&rdquo; as follows:
<QUOTE><P>To settle oneself or a thing in a place, to be stationed, to remain or stay, to dwell permanently or continuously, to have a settled abode for a time, to have one's residence or domicile; specifically, to be in residence, to have an abiding place, to be present as an element, to inhere as a quality, to be vested as a right.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM>, 6<SUP>th</SUP> ed., s.v. &ldquo;reside&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. The term &ldquo;residing&rdquo; has been considered in the insurance context by the Courts and, specifically, in relation to the exclusion in question. In this context, &ldquo;residing&rdquo; has been found to import a connotation of, if not permanence, at least an extended stay. It is something beyond a temporary visit.

<P1><BOLD><EM>Appel (Public Trustee of)</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paragraph 69.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. In this case, the evidence of both Ms. Gibson Junior and Ms. Gibson Senior is that Ms. Gibson Junior was living in Ms. Gibson Senior's home at the relevant time. The two had been living in the home together as mother and daughter for approximately 61 years.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Westworth Affidavit at paragraph 17</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. In fact, in her Statement of Claim, Ms. Gibson Junior describes herself as, &ldquo;a tenant residing at XXXXXXXXXX, the Province of Ontario&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Statement of Claim, at paragraph</EM>2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. It is submitted that Ms. Gibson Junior was residing in the Premises at all material times.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>&ldquo;Household&rdquo;</EM></TI>
<P>42. Black's Law Dictionary defines &ldquo;household&rdquo; as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Belonging to the house and family. A family living together. A group of people who dwell under the same roof. The contents of a house.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM>, 9<SUP>th</SUP> ed., s.v. &ldquo;household&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. The Supreme Court of Canada has considered the term &ldquo;household&rdquo; in the insurance context. In <CASEREF><SOC>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance v. Bell</SOC></CASEREF>, the court was considering whether the insured was driving a vehicle which was &ldquo;owned by a person of the household of which the insured was a member&rdquo;; if this was the case, there would be no coverage.</P>
<P>44. When considering the term &ldquo;household&rdquo;, Justice Rand made the following statements:
<QUOTE><P>Both the Oxford and Century dictionaries make it clear that the term &ldquo;household&rdquo; is of flexible meaning. In the general understanding it is associated and at times identical with what is connoted by &ldquo;family&rdquo; or &ldquo;domestic establishment&rdquo; The characteristics of the relations between members of the household are so varied and of such different degree or significance that it is quite impossible to define the word in detailed terms applicable to all cases; and to come to a conclusion as to its scope as it is used in the policy request that we resort to the ordinary aids of interpretation. The exception is in the language of the company, and if it is ambiguous the ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the insured; and a material consideration to be taken into account if the purpose intended to be served by it.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 583.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. Justice Rand went on to state the purposes of the exclusion was to prevent members of a household from making common use of their cars, thus limiting the insurance taken out and creating favourable conditions for collusion on claims.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 583.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. Justice Rand continued with the following comments:
<QUOTE><P>The &ldquo;household&rdquo;, in the broad sense of a family, is a collective group living in a home, acknowledging the authority of a head, the members of which, with few exceptions, are bound by marriage, blood, affinity or other bond, between whom there is an intimacy and by whom there is felt a concern with and an interest in the life of all that gives it a unity. It may, for example, include such persons as domestic servants, and distant relatives permanently residing within it. To some degree they are all admitted and submit to the collective body, its unity and its conditions, particularly that of the general discipline of the family head. They do not share fully in the more restricted family intimacy or interest or concern, but they participate to a substantial degree in the general life of the household and form part of it.</P>
<P>These are persons &ldquo;of&rdquo; the household. A distinction between being &ldquo;of&rdquo; and &ldquo;in&rdquo; a household is made in the policy itself. In the case of theft the insured is not protected when it is committed by a person &ldquo;in&rdquo; in the household. On the argument my first impression was that one &ldquo;in&rdquo; the household is necessarily &ldquo;of&rdquo; it, but further consideration has led me to a different view. The circle of those &ldquo;in&rdquo; is larger than those &ldquo;of&rdquo;, a good example of which is furnished by the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Home Ins. Co. v. Pettit</SOC><YEAR>1932</YEAR><CITE>[143 S. 839]</CITE></CASEREF>. There the exception was of theft by a person &ldquo;in&rdquo; in the household of the insured and an uncle, temporarily a guest of the insured's father, was held to be of that description.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 583.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. In <CASEREF><SOC>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance v. Bell</SOC></CASEREF>, the insured was found to <EM>not</EM> to be member <EM>of</EM> his brother's household, but rather was a member <EM>in</EM> his brother's household. Relevant factors in coming to this conclusion included the following facts: the insured was paying his brother room and board and was working; he had no permission to drive his brother's vehicle (which addresses the purpose of the exclusion clause); and, while the insured's stay was indefinite, he was engaged and intended on setting up his own household with his soon-to-be wife. In sum, Justice Rand found that the insured's interests and concerns were primarily his own and not more related to the family life of his brother than if he had been living apart. Thus, while he was a member <EM>in</EM> his brother's household, he was not a member <EM>of</EM> the household.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 583.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>48. It is notable that the exclusion in the present case contemplates the larger household circle enunciated by Justice Rand in <CASEREF><SOC>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance v. Bell</SOC></CASEREF> by virtue of the use of the phrase, &ldquo;residing <EM>in</EM> your household&rdquo;.</P>
<P>49. The enlargement of the concept of the term &ldquo;household&rdquo; through the use of the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; was subsequently accepted in <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Canada Inc. v. Yaehne</SOC></CASEREF>, which considered the exclusion at issue in the present case. In Aviva, Justice Barclay indicated that &ldquo;in&rdquo; may enlarge the concept of household, but the foundation of the word is an intangible relationship between individuals.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Canada Inc. v. Yaehne</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. In <CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Canada Inc. v. Yaehne</SOC></CASEREF>, the insured's adult son was found not to be member residing in the insured's household. The basis for this decision was the inability to characterize the relationship as one of intimacy or community in which their daily lives were inextricably bound together. They cooked their own meals, ate their meals separately and the insured's on was only responsible for cleaning his basement area. Further, the basement area of the home was. considered to be for the son's exclusive privacy and use.</P>
<P>51. It is submitted the present case can be distinguished from <EM>Wawanesa</EM> and <EM>Aviva</EM> in a number of ways. It is clear the parties shared an interest in each other's lives beyond that of mere roommates or a landlord/tenant relationship. This is demonstrated by the fact that they both contributed to the household financially, as well as in terms of housekeeping tasks. More significantly, they ate meals together regularly, entertained together and assisted one another with personal tasks, for example making each other's beds and attending medical appointments together. They clearly lived together as a family, as mother and daughter in the same household.</P>
<P>52. In sum, the relationship between Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior was indicative of the intimacy and community which demonstrates the existence of a household.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Landlord/tenant Relationship</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>53. The existence of landlord/tenant relationship does not preclude the possibility that the parties are residing in the same household.</P>
<P>54. This is evident by the fact that the existence of such a relationship has not ended the analysis of whether one is residing in the household in numerous cases.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aviva Canada Inc. v. Yaehne</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM>.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. Further, in the present case, there was no written agreement between Ms. Gibson Senior and Ms. Gibson Junior. Defining Ms. Gibson Junior's financial contribution to the household as &ldquo;rent&rdquo; does not negate the intimate household which existed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK0><TI>RESPONDING PARTY'S FACTUM</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Applicant, Traders General Insurance Company (&ldquo;Traders&rdquo;), brings the within application seeking a declaration that it is not required to indemnify the Respondent, Elizabeth Gibson (&ldquo;Elizabeth&rdquo;), pursuant to a homeowners policy of insurance issued by Traders under policy number XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) for any amounts she may be found liable to pay in relation to a legal action commenced against her by her now deceased daughter Elizabeth Thompson Gibson (&ldquo;Betty&rdquo;), in court file number CV-14-507726 (the &ldquo;Action&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Elizabeth is a 96 year old living on her own in her own home.</P>
<P>3. Trader's submits that Elizabeth does not have coverage because her daughter Betty was a &lsquo;relative&rsquo; living in the household and any claim for bodily injury while living in the household is excluded. They say there is no coverage.</P>
<P>4. Elizabeth's position is that the exclusion clause is not applicable given the living arrangement and relationship with Betty, who was a <BOLD>&lsquo;residence employee&rsquo;</BOLD> as defined in the Policy and/or Tenant. Betty was paying a very low rent of $400.00 per month for her and her son to live at Elizabeth's house. In exchange for the low rent, Betty agreed to do significant household and domestic work at the residence. Betty is a &lsquo;residence employee&rsquo; under the Policy for whom there is coverage and a duty to defend. Traders' has a duty to continue to defend Elizabeth and indemnify her in the event she is found legally liable at trial.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>5. Elizabeth is a 96 year old widow living on her own at XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;). Her daughter Betty died on XXXXXXXXXX.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Elizabeth Gibson sworn September 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018, para 2 (&ldquo;Affidavit EG&rdquo;)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. Elizabeth married her husband Alexander Gibson (&ldquo;Alex&rdquo;) in 1945 and together they had three children:
<P1>a) Catrina Gibson who was born XXXXXXXXXX;</P1>
<P1>b) Robert Gibson was born XXXXXXXXXX; and</P1>
<P1>c) Betty was born XXXXXXXXXX.</P1>
(collectively the &ldquo;Gibsons&rdquo;)
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 7-8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. In 1951, they emigrated from Scotland to Toronto with their three young children. Initially, they rented the Property for a number of years and in 1961 they purchased the Property from the previous Landlord. The Gibson?s spent considerable amount of time and money fixing the house as it required a number of upgrades and was in disarray but suitable for their growing family.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. In the late 1960's there were a number of events that transpired that resulted in changes to the living arrangements at the Property, beginning with the death of Alex in XXXXXXXXXX. In 1968, Catrina married and moved out of the residence, and shortly thereafter, Robert followed suit in 1970. As of 1970, Elizabeth and Betty were the only two residing at the Property.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. Elizabeth was employed with MacLean Hunter in the sales department from 1959 to 1987 when she retired.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Relationship and Living Arrangement with Betty</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. Elizabeth had a close relationship with her daughter Betty and shared a number of common interests.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. Betty met her long-term partner Michael Singh (&ldquo;Singh&rdquo;) in early 1980's but they were never married. They had a child together named Michael Alexander Gibson (&ldquo;Alexander&rdquo;), who was born on XXXXXXXXXX.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Elizabeth after her retirement provided day-care services for Alexander when he was very young so that Betty could continue to work and in exchange. Betty and Michael would provide remuneration for her to do so.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. In 1996, Betty was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and ceased her employment with Ontario Development Corporation and placed on long-term disability. The tumor was removed but re-emerged in 2000 when she had a second procedure. In 2006 she had a heart-attack and as a result received a pace-maker in 2007 and subsequently a larger one in 2013. Her medical and physical health deteriorated immensely from 1996 to 2016.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Betty's long-term disability benefits ceased in or about 2014 and thereafter, she started to receive payments from CPP.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. Given Betty's medical conditions and complications for the latter part of her life, she was either on long-term disability and/or CPP and as such, had limited financial resources. Her medical and physical condition prevented her from returning to full-time employment and consequently affected her ability to make a livelihood to be able to provide the basic necessities for herself and her son, Alexander. Her finances were limited.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. As a result of Betty's financial circumstances and in order to assist her, Elizabeth agreed to accept a low monthly rent in the amount of $400.00. Elizabeth who at the time was 77 years old also lived on a pension and required the supplementary rental payments in order to pay for all utilities, including gas. hydro and property taxes. Any additional services Betty required were paid by herself and not part of the living arrangement with Elizabeth. In exchange for living at the Property and paying a low monthly rent, it was agreed that Betty would provide and carry out various duties with respect to the maintenance and use of the Property including household and domestic services as occasionally needed on an on-going basis including:
<P1>i. Carry out cleaning, dusting and vacuuming of the Property;</P1>
<P1>ii. Assisting with mowing the lawn and gardening;</P1>
<P1>iii. Assisting with grocery shopping;</P1>
<P1>iv. Assisting with laundry;</P1>
<P1>v. Assisting with cooking and/or alternating;</P1>
<P1>vi. Accompanying Elizabeth to medical appointments;</P1>
<P1>vii. Coordinate with any contractors for repairs or maintenance of the Property such as painting or property repairs;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 21</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. This was the living arrangement Elizabeth had with Betty that was mutually beneficially, in light of the financial circumstances faced by Betty in the latter part of her life given her medical conditions.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Elizabeth's evidence is that the household domestic services performed by her daughter in exchange for a lower rent, were of value to her.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 23</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. In addition to the mutually beneficially living arrangement Betty wanted to continue living at the Property for a number of reasons including:
<P1>i. She was on long-term disability and received minimal monthly income payments and that subsequently was converted to her CPP and she could not afford to rent or live alone;</P1>
<P1>ii. She had a number of medical conditions that precluded her from returning to full-time employment or be employed in a conventional employment setting&mdash;this arrangement allowed her to carry out household and domestic services on as needed basis and with frequent breaks and rest;</P1>
<P1>iii. She was responsible for Alexander who required care and space;</P1>
<P1>iv. She had an unstable relationship with Singh.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 25</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Accident</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. On March 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2014 Betty fell off the front porch at the Property and sustained injuries. As a result of those injuries, in July of 2014 Betty commenced an Action against Elizabeth.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. Elizabeth reported the accident to Traders and met with an adjuster in August of 2014 and provided a statement detailing the information and knowledge that she had with respect to the accident and surrounding circumstances. Elizabeth also advised that Betty was resident at the Property.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 26</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. In July of 2015, the parties attended examination for discovery. Betty died on XXXXXXXXXX prior to the resolution of the Action. The Estate obtained an Order to Continue the Action.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit EG, para 2, 4</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES, LAW &amp; AUTHORITIES</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Key Policy Provisions</TI>
<P>23. Elizabeth obtained a Policy from Traders that was specifically obtained for the Property as residence. The declarations page refers to the policy form as &lsquo;dwelling building&rdquo;. The coverage summary includes Property and Liability Coverages.</P>

<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Betty was a &ldquo;Residence Employee&rdquo; and Therefore not an Insured Under the Policy</TI>
<P>29. The interpretation of the exclusion clause taken by Traders is incorrect when compared to the nature and substance of the living arrangement and relationship between Elizabeth and Betty. Trader's interpretation of the exclusion clause disregards the fact that Betty was providing domestic services to Elizabeth in exchange of low monthly rental payments given her financial and medical circumstances. Based on these facts and in light of their living arrangement, Betty was a &lsquo;residence employee&rsquo; as defined in the Policy who performed duties in connection with the maintenance and use of the premises which included household and domestic services.</P>
<P>30. Accordingly, since residence employee is expressly excluded from the exclusion relied on by Traders, the insurer is liable to indemnify Elizabeth under the Policy.</P>
<P>31. Due to the inherent power imbalance between an insured and an insurer, as well as the adhesionary nature of the insurance contract, coverage provisions are construed broadly and ambiguity is construed in favour of the insured:
<QUOTE><P>Since insurance contracts are essentially adhesionary, the standard practice is to construe ambiguities against the insurer: <CASEREF><SOC>Brissette Estate v.

<P>32. Trader's Policy defines &ldquo;insured&rdquo; as i) his or her spouse, ii) the relatives of either; and iii) any person under the age of 21 in their care. The term &lsquo;relatives&rsquo; is not defined in the Policy, but more importantly, the term &lsquo;residence employee&rsquo; is not included in the definition of the insured. As such, Betty's role was certainly &ldquo;in connection with the maintenance or use of the insured premises&rdquo; which included &ldquo;household or domestic services or duties of a similar nature&rdquo;.</P>
<P>33. There are few Canadian decisions that have considered the definition of &ldquo;residence employee&rdquo; or related definitions such as &ldquo;farm employee&rdquo;. Consistent with the modern approach to the interpretation of insurance contracts, the court does not undertake a particularly formulistic analysis. The decisions illustrate that the usual indices of employment need not be present in order for a person to qualify as an employee under an insurance contract and thereby fall within the coverage grant.</P>
<P>34. In <CASEREF><SOC>Wawanesa Mutual Ins. Co. v.

The son had been hurt while lifting a barrel of hay and sued his father. If the son was an employee then the exclusion for &ldquo;injuries to persons living in the household&rdquo; would not apply and his father would have coverage under his homeowner's policy.</P>
<P>35. Despite that this was a son working on the family farm and that the compensation was inadequate and not fixed or paid systematically, the court held that the son was indeed his father's employee. The pertinent analysis is found at paras 40 to 44 of the decision:
<QUOTE><P>40 <UNDER>The issue of whether a person is an employee is a factual one which must be determined upon a consideration of the particular circumstances</UNDER>. This case is no different....</P>
<P>41 I make particular reference to these circumstances. <UNDER>Dayton Hewson did almost all the work involved in the cattle operation</UNDER>. The amount of work was significant, necessary and well beyond what is considered to be chores. It was performed on a daily basis. Yet while he did this work, it was done under the direction and control of Larry Hewson who also sometimes helped. While Larry Hewson would have acted in the capacity of Dayton's father, a role which never ceased, this did not preclude him from also acting as an employer. <UNDER>He was the owner of the cattle operation and be engaged his son to keep it functioning. Yet any profit or loss flowing from the cattle operation was that of the father</UNDER>. In short, the working arrangement was that of any business.</P>
<P>42 Dayton Hewson obtain compensation which was over and above normal care provided to a child, by parents. The compensation was not fixed nor was it paid systematically. <UNDER>As well, it was inadequate for the work done</UNDER>. <UNDER>However, it was real</UNDER>. It consisted of cash payments on a fairly regular basis, delivery of cattle on a regular basis, supplying of feed for Dayton's animals and, on one occasion, the purchase of a vehicle. <UNDER>Perhaps some of this would have been provided absent the labour, but I am certain it would have been significantly less</UNDER>.</P>
<P>43 I recognize that there were no remittances for Employment Insurance, Workers' Compensation premiums or Canada Pension Plan contributions. As it happens, there was no requirement for his. Accordingly, no significance can be attached to it.</P>

<P>36. In <CASEREF><SOC>Duquette v. Kent &amp; Essex Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1992] O.J. No. 1036</CITE><COURTJUR>G.D.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> two brothers each worked on the other's nearby farm. One was returning a Gleaner combine that his brother had rented when he made an improper left turn and caused damage to a tractor-trailer. The homeowner's policy would respond if the driver had been a &ldquo;residence employee&rdquo; or &ldquo;farm employee&rdquo;. The insurer took the position that the brother was a volunteer who had only performed services gratuitously.</P>
<P>37. In deciding that the brother constituted the other's &ldquo;employee&rdquo; the court did not look to the common law test. Rather, because the court was tasked with the interpretation of an insurance contract, the court looked to the plain and ordinary meaning of the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;. This was found to be &ldquo;one who works for another for wages or some other valuable consideration.&rdquo; The court noted that the brother had indeed been working for the other and found that the consideration for the work was the exchange of labour. The common law test was only assessed to reaffirm the conclusion already made:
<QUOTE><P>27 I conclude that the broad context of this part of the policy shows that the drafter of the policy must have intended that the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, as used in clause (c)(iv), would include someone like Raymond Duquette <UNDER>who was working for his brother under an exchange-of-labour arrangement of a long and virtually permanent nature</UNDER>. Why else, one might ask, would the drafter take the trouble in the exclusions section to include a person who was performing such a neighbourly exchange of labour? <UNDER>Also, why else would the drafter cast the language of the definition of &ldquo;farm employee&rdquo; so broadly?</UNDER></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>31 Professor E.R. Hardy Ivamy, in his text, General Principles of Insurance Law, 4th ed. (London: Butterworths, 1979), at p. 355, points to 13 principal rules of construction for insurance policies. A critical rule amongst this interrelated group of rules is that, absent clear countervailing evidence, &ldquo;the ordinary meaning of the words will be adopted&rdquo;.</P>
<P>32 There is nothing in clause (c)(iv), or its related context, which indicates that it is to be given some narrow or specialized meaning that would remove Raymond from its reach. <UNDER>The plain and ordinary meaning of the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; is one who works for another for wages <BOLD>or some other valuable consideration</BOLD></UNDER>. Raymond fits that definition because he was, at the relevant time, working for his brother, using equipment provided by his brother, and at the direction and control of his brother. <UNDER>The consideration for the work was the exchange of labour.</UNDER> The definition of farm employee, found later in the definitions proviso, simply reinforces my view that Raymond is covered by the term.</P>
<P>33 Even assuming that the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; as used in the policy, should be construed by reference to the master-servant doctrine at common law, the result must be the same. In Blacks Law Dictionary 5th ed. (St. Paul, Minn. West Publishing Co. 1979) at p. 879, one finds this useful American definition of the master and servant concept:
<QUOTE><P>The relation of master and servant exists where one person, for pay <BOLD><UNDER>or other valuable consideration</UNDER></BOLD>, enters into the service of another and devotes to him his personal labour for an agreed period. The relation exists where the employer has the right to select the employee, the power to remove and discharge him and the right to direct both what work shall be done and the manner in which it shall be done ... Such term has generally been replaced by &ldquo;employer and employee&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34 In Canada, the courts have also moved away somewhat from the old &ldquo;control&rdquo; test to a four-part test for determining the essence of the master-servant relationship. I am of the opinion that the evidence in this case would support a finding that Raymond was an employee under the common law doctrine: see <CASEREF><SOC>Telegram Publishing Co. v. Amm</SOC><YEAR>1979</YEAR><CITE>23 O.R. (2d) 103</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>94 D.L.R. (3d) 456</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, and <CASEREF><SOC>Mayer v. J.

<P>35 <UNDER>It might also be stated here that if the insurer had wished to create a narrower scope for the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, it could have easily done so in clearer and more precise language.</UNDER> On the language used, I can only conclude that Raymond's accident fell within the coverage of s. 11 of the policy.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. The evidence of Elizabeth is that the household domestic work done by Betty was of value to her.</P>
<P>39. The dictionary definitions of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employ&rdquo;, like the definition of &ldquo;residence employee&rdquo; in the Trader's Policy, are quite broad&mdash;the former refers to a person performing service under an express or implied contract and the latter refers to a person used as an agent in a transaction. Certainly the facts of this case meet those definitions.</P>
<P>40. Traders drafted the Policy. Had it wished a narrower definition to apply, it could have included wording to achieve that result. Any uncertainty in this regard ought to be resolved against Traders and in favour of the insured.
<P1>&ldquo;Employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employ&rdquo;, Black's Law Dictionary, 8d (2004, Thomson: St. Paul, MN)</P1></P>
<P>41. In any event, the facts of this case also fall within the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; as analyzed in <EM>Hewson</EM> and <EM>Duquette</EM>. In the present case, Betty certainly performed duties in connection with the maintenance or use of the premises including household and domestic services. She performed most tasks associated with the management of the Property. There is also no question that she received consideration in exchange for her services that being benefit of having a low monthly rent. Even if this is considered &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;&mdash;which it was not considering her physical and medical condition to obtain employment&mdash;it was &ldquo;real&rdquo;. In short, Betty was Elizabeth's employee and, accordingly, was a &ldquo;residence employee&rdquo; within the definition of the Traders Policy.</P>
<P>42. In a recent decision <CASEREF><SOC>Economical Mutual Insurance Co. v. Optium West Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[2018] B.C.J No. 1312</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Economical Mutual&rdquo;) Justice Funt considered an identical definition of &lsquo;residence employee&rsquo; provision in the insurance policy and stated:
<QUOTE><P>29. In reading closely the definition of &ldquo;residence employee&rdquo;, several aspects are noteworthy. First, the second sentence serves to expand the meaning of the first sentence by referring to &ldquo;services or duties&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;duties&rdquo;. Second, the third sentence is clearly a limiting provision. That said, its scope is meant to be narrow. It refers to persons &ldquo;while performing&rdquo; as opposed to persons &ldquo;who perform&rdquo; as used in the second sentence. Third, each of the second and third sentences start with the word &ldquo;This&rdquo;, thus referring to the definition. Finally, each of the second and the third sentences use the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and not &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, which serves to place greater emphasis on that which is performed and not the individual's relationship with the policy holder.</P>
<P>30. <UNDER>I do not read the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo; in the first sentence of the definition as limited by employment law strictures.</UNDER> For example, a homeowner may employ a neighbourhood teenager to shovel the driveway for, say, $20. Although the relationship may not be viewed as an employer-employee relationship under employment law, the teenager is employed by the homeowner. In other words, a task to be performed for remuneration gives rise to employment.</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>43. It is submitted that Betty was a residence employee under the Policy and Trader's is obliged to continue to defend Elizabeth and there is coverage for any loss or damage assessed against her in the Action.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Betty was a Tenant</TI>
<P>44. Betty paid rent of $400.00 a month and was a Tenant of Elizabeth. As such, she was not an insured as defined in the Policy and not &lsquo;a person residing in the household&rsquo;. The term &lsquo;tenant&rsquo; is also not a defined term in the Policy. Furthermore, the Policy does not exclude bodily injury to a Tenant resulting from an intentional or criminal act or failure to act.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Traders Has a Duty to Defend</TI>
<P>45. An insurer's duty to defend is &ldquo;much broader&rdquo; than the duty to indemnify. The court determines whether an insurer has a duty to defend based on the claims made in the pleadings without reference to extrinsic evidence (subject to certain exceptions, not applicable here). The threshold is low. The mere possibility that a claim advanced on the pleadings may require an insurer to indemnify under a policy of insurance is all that is required for a duty to defend to arise. If there is any possibility that the claim may fall within the liability coverage, then the insurer must defend (even where the insured expressly denies a fact that must be proved in order for the claim to come within cover).

<P>46. In interpreting the policy, the usual principles governing the construction of insurance contracts apply&mdash;namely, the <EM>contra proferentem</EM> rule, the principle that coverage clauses should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly, and that the policy must give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd's of London v. Scalera</SOC><CITE>2000 SCC 24</CITE><PARANUM>70 to 71</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>47. If the pleadings are not sufficiently precise to determine whether the claims would be covered by the policy, then the insurer's obligation to defend will be triggered where, on a reasonable reading of the pleadings, a claim within coverage can be inferred. To put it another way, &ldquo;the widest latitude should be given to the allegations in the pleadings in determining whether they raise a claim within the policy.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Monenco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 49</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nichols v. American Home Assurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1990] S.C. J. No. 33</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>48. Once an insured demonstrates that the pleadings give rise to the <BOLD>mere possibility</BOLD> of a claim within cover, the onus shifts to the insurer to show that the claim falls outside the coverage because of an exclusion clause. When addressing an insurer's reliance on an exclusion clause, the court must approach the pleading on the basis that some, but not all, of the pleaded allegations may be made out. If one theory of liability would not trigger coverage, but another one would, a duty to defend will arise.

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>Indemnity</TI>
<P>49. Under the duty to defend analysis, the question is whether there is a mere possibility of a claim falling within cover, however, with respect to indemnity, the question is whether the claim in fact falls within the coverage. The Trader Policy provides for coverage for legal liability arising out of the ownership, use or occupancy of the Property. The plaintiff's (ie. Betty) claim against Elizabeth arose out of the ownership, use and occucancy of the Property. Elizabeth being the owner and the insured who may be held legally liable at trial. If Elizabeth is an insured under the Traders Policy, then she is entitled to an indemnity from Traders for any damages awarded against her subject to any applicable exclusion.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>Claims Arising out of the Use, Occupancy of the Property Are Covered Under the Policy</TI>
<P>50. Once a party has proved that a coverage provision applies, the onus shifts to the insurer to prove that an exclusion clause applies. If there is any doubt as to the meaning and scope of the excluding or limiting term, that doubt must be resolved against the insurer who inserted and seeks to rely upon it. As it is the insurer who seeks protection from liability to which it would otherwise be subject, the insurer must prove that the words clearly and unambiguously exclude the subject claim.

<P>51. In <EM>Consolidated Bathurst</EM> the Supreme Court of Canada held that if the whole, or main, point of procuring the policy would be defeated by an interpretation, then the court will avoid that interpretation (para 26):
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>Even apart from the doctrine of <EM>contra proferentem</EM> as it may be applied in the construction of contracts, the normal rules of construction lead a court to search for an interpretation which, from the whole of the contract, would appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties at the time of entry into the contract. Consequently, literal meaning should not be applied where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or a result which would not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was contracted</UNDER>. Where words may bear two constructions, the more reasonable one, that which produces a fair result, must certainly be taken as the interpretation which would promote the intention of the parties. Similarly, an interpretation which defeats the intentions of the parties and their objective in entering into the commercial transaction in the first place should be discarded in favour of an interpretation of the policy which promotes a sensible commercial result. It is trite to observe that an interpretation of an ambiguous contractual provision which would render the endeavour on the part of the insured to obtain insurance protection nugatory, should be avoided. <UNDER>Said another way, the courts should be loath to support a construction which would either enable the insurer to pocket the premium without risk or the insured to achieve a recovery which could neither be sensibly sought nor anticipated at the time of the contract.</UNDER></P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>52. The Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Consolidated Bathurst</EM> cited with approval a passage from <CASEREF><SOC>Cornish v. Accident Insurance Company</SOC><YEAR>1889</YEAR><CITE>23 Q.B. 453</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> in which the court commented that, if the object of the policy was to insure against a specific class of claims, then it should not be construed in a manner that would defeat that object:
<QUOTE><P>The object of the contract is to insure against accidental death and injuries, and the contract must not be construed so as to defeat that object, nor so as to render it practically illusory.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>53. That the court should avoid a construction which would virtually nullify the coverage sought is a well-accepted principle that has been consistently applied in Canada. For example, in interpreting an exclusion clause in <CASEREF><SOC>Weston Ornamental Iron Works Ltd v Continental Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>[1981] O.J. No. 78</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> the Ontario Court of Appeal held at para 16 as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[16] ...The exclusion clause should not be interpreted in a way which is repugnant to or inconsistent with the main purpose of the insurance coverage but so as to give effect to it. <UNDER>Thus, even if the exemption clause were found to be clear and unambiguous it should not be enforced by the courts when the result would be to defeat the main object of the contract or virtually nullify the coverage sought for protection from anticipated risks</UNDER>...</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. A similar statement of the law was made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Zurich Insurance Co v 686234 Ontario Ltd</SOC><CITE>[2002] O.J. No. 4496</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>leave to appeal dismissed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>[2003] S.C.C.A. No. 33</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[28] From Weston Ornamental Iron Works it is clear that this court has concluded that even though an exclusion clause may be clear and unambiguous, <UNDER>it will not be applied where: (1) it is inconsistent with the main purpose of the insurance coverage and where the result would be to virtually nullify the coverage provided by the policy</UNDER>; and (2) where to apply it would be contrary to the reasonable expectations of the ordinary person as to the coverage purchased.</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. In the present case the Traders Policy was obtained for the express purpose of providing liability coverage in respect of ownership, use and occupancy of the Property. Residence employee is not specifically incorporated into the definition of &ldquo;insured&rdquo;.</P>
<P>56. Trader's interpretation would also be contrary to the parties' reasonable expectations. It had to have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the owners might employ others in respect of the dwelling Property. Whether it is someone to remove weeds and cut the grass, neighbor to power was the driveway or a family member to manage the maintenance the Property. In circumstances where the Policy was obtained for the implied and express purpose of providing liability courage in respect of the ownership, use and occupancy of the Property, the Policy must necessarily reasonable expected to provide liability coverage for persons so employed.</P>
<P>57. In summary, if this court determines that Betty was a &lsquo;residence employee&rsquo;, then she is not an insured under the Trader's Policy and as result, Elizabeth is entitled to be insured against claims arising from the ownership, use and occupancy of the Property including plaintiff's claim in the Action. This interpretation accords with the express wording of the Trader's Policy as well as the longstanding principles applicable to the proper interpretation of insurance policies.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>Prejudice to Elizabeth as result of the delay in bringing the within Application</TI>
<P>58. Elizabeth met with an adjuster on or about August 2014 and provided information and a detailed statement with respect to the accident and surrounding circumstances including her living arrangement and relationship with Betty. Trader's knew or ought to have known that Betty had been residing at the Property since 1953 or when it was purchased in 1961.</P>
<P>59. On September 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 2014&mdash;Trader's wrote a letter to Elizabeth advising her that they were denying coverage based on the exclusion clauses now being relied upon on this Application. Yet, Trader's continued to defend Elizabeth.</P>
<P>60. The parties attended examination for discovery on July 20<SUP>th</SUP> and 27<SUP>th</SUP>, of 2015. The examinations for discovery were focused on the surrounding circumstances prior to the accident and injuries sustained by Betty. They were not specifically addressing the living arrangement and relationship between Elizabeth and Betty. Nor were there any follow-up questions sought to ascertain why this living arrangement had been in place or as mutually agreed.</P>
<P>61. On XXXXXXXXXX Betty unfortunately died.</P>
<P>62. On or about February 2018, Trader's serves Elizabeth with the applicant's Application Record after 4 years of having knowledge with respect to the exclusion clause. As result of the delay in bringing the within Application&mdash;Elizabeth is prejudiced from:
<P1><BOLD>i.</BOLD> the use of the transcripts from the examination for discovery that were specific to the injuries sustained and surrounding circumstances. They were not related to the declaration and relief being sought by Traders and it is unfair to her to use them against her;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>ii.</BOLD> she has her evidence but the inability to provide the evidence of Betty to confirm the agreement concerning the low rent and the household domestic services;</P1>
