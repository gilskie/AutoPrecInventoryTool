To the contrary, they converted and misappropriated the 61 Columbia Opportunity for their own benefit to the exclusion of the plaintiffs. Consequently, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damages.

<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> STATEMENT OF DEFENCE</TI>
<P>1. The Defendants deny all allegations in the <UNDER>Fresh as Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim unless otherwise expressly admitted herein.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Defendants' Position</TI>
<P>2. The Defendants Gordon Schembri (&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;) and Schembri Financial Limited (&ldquo;Schembri Financial&rdquo;) acknowledge that they entered into the Shareholder Agreement as that term is defined in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. The Plaintiff's claim is based upon Article 13 of the Shareholder Agreement (the Non-Competition Provision).</P>
<P>4. The Defendants allege that the Non-Competition provision is contrary to public policy, ambiguous, too broad and unnecessary to protect the Plaintiffs' legitimate business or commercial interests and is, in law, of no force or effect and is unenforceable.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background Leading Up to the Shareholder Agreement</TI>
<P>5. Between 2005 and 2007 Schembri assembled various parcels of land in the City of Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario (the &ldquo;345 King Street Lands&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. Schembri's intention in assembling the 345 King Street Lands were to demolish the Premises thereon and redevelop same.</P>
<P>7. Ultimately, Schembri and the Plaintiff Al Way (&ldquo;Way&rdquo;) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the &ldquo;JVA&rdquo;) with respect to the redevelopment of the 345 King Street lands. At that time to the knowledge of Way, Schembri was not a person of means and accordingly it was understood that Way would be required to fund and finance the development.</P>
<P>8. The JVA provided, inter alia, as follows:
<P1>(a) Schembri would receive a return of his equity and then Schembri and Way, or their designated entities, would each receive 50% of the profits from the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands;</P1>
<P1>(b) By reason of Schembri's limited financial resources, it was agreed that Way and his entity would be responsible for obtaining financing for the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands;</P1>
<P1>(c) Construction contracts would be awarded by both Way or his designated entities through an &ldquo;open book concept&rdquo; except for work performed by Jamesway Construction, a company owned and controlled by Way, which was to be a fixed price contract reflected in the agreed upon budget;</P1>
<P1>(d) A budget was agreed upon and appended to the JVA. No increase in the agreed upon budget could be made without the unanimous written agreement of both Schembri and Way through their designated entities.</P1></P>
<P>9. Way and his corporations took control of the redevelopment of 345 King Street.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the JVA, Way and his corporations owed fiduciary duties to Schembri and his corporations.</P>
<P>11. Pursuant to the JVA and the agreed upon budget the profit anticipated through the redevelopment was approximately $10 million dollars.</P>
<P>12. Ultimately the redevelopment was completed and the redeveloped 345 King Street lands were sold for approximately $29 million dollars.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background relating to Triumph Financial Holdings Inc. (&ldquo;Triumph Financial&rdquo;)</TI>
<P>13. The Shareholders Agreement provided, <EM>inter alia</EM>, as follows:
<P1>(a) The Plaintiff, Kingsley Financial Inc. (&ldquo;Kingsley&rdquo;) would own 55% of the shares of Triumph Financial and Schembri Financial would own the remaining 45%;</P1>
<P1>(b) Kingsley received 55% of the said share because it was recognized that Way and his entity would be required to fund and finance any development without contribution from Schembri. Schembri Financial received 45% in recognition of Schembri's offer to assemble, acquire and rezone and obtain all required permits for the properties;</P1>
<P1>(c) Each of Way and Schembri, or their respective nominees were directors;</P1>
<P1>(d) Way was president and Schembri was secretary-treasurer;</P1>
<P1>(e) Way, as President, had the ability to sign all contracts on behalf of Triumph Financial, except in respect of matters relating to land acquisition, mortgage financing, construction budgets and project feasibility, which required the signatures of both Way and Schembri or their designates;</P1>
<P1>(f) Each of the directors had one vote and Way, as chairman, did not have any additional or casting vote. Accordingly, if Way and Schembri did hot agree, then the board of directors would be deadlocked;</P1>
<P1>(g) Unanimous shareholder approval was required for Triumph Financial:
<P2>(i) to directly or indirectly make any loans or advances, or invest in or give security for, or guarantee the debts of any other Corporation or person;</P2>
<P2>(ii) to enter into any partnership or arrangement for the sharing of profits or joint venture with any person, firm, or corporation, except in the normal course of business;</P2>
<P2>(iii) to mortgage or encumber any of its assets;</P2>
<P2>(iv) to commit to any financing arrangement with any third parties;</P2>
<P2>(v) to undertake any project without initiating project feasibility studies and construction budget approvals.</P2></P1>
<P1>(h) The invalidity of any provision of the Shareholders Agreement or any covenant contained therein would not affect the validity of any other provision or covenant therein;</P1>
<P1>(i) It was expressly agreed and understood that the Shareholders Agreement did not constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint enterprise;</P1>
<P1>(j) Way agreed to provide or acquire all financing and guarantees for any projects undertaken by Triumph Financial.</P1></P>
<P>14. At the time the Shareholders Agreement was being negotiated. 345 Kang Street had not yet started to be constructed and, to the knowledge of Way, Schembri's financial situation had not changed.</P>
<P>15. In anticipation of entering into a Shareholder Agreement, Schembri assembled and acquired three properties, one in each of Oshawa, Waterloo and London, in the Province of Ontario, for redevelopment. This was all done before 345 King Street construction commenced and before and during the negotiations of the Shareholder's Agreement.</P>
<P>16. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement it was contemplated that the redevelopment of these properties would be through Triumph Financial's Subsidiary corporations being 359 King Ontario Inc., Oxford and First St. Inc. and Simcoe and Eastwood Ave Inc. (the &ldquo;Triumph Subsidiaries&rdquo;).</P>
<P>17. Schembri or his corporate entities only received $1,400,000.00 from the profits generated by the JVA. Schembri demanded an accounting from Way. He finally received one but it was inaccurate, incomplete and fraudulent. Way refused to provide full and accurate financial disclosure and continues to refuse as of the date of this pleading. To this date, notwithstanding being ordered by this Honourable Court to do so, Way had not done so.</P>
<P>18. As a result Schembri and various corporate entities owned or controlled by him commenced a proceeding against Way and various related corporations owned or controlled by him in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto. This action was subsequently transferred to Kitchener and now bears Court File CV-42-11 (the &ldquo;First Action&rdquo;). In the First Action Schembri and the other Plaintiffs sought significant damages as against Way and his corporations and the appointment of a receiver with respect to Oxford and First St. Inc., Simcoe and Eastwood Ave Inc. and 359 King Ontario Inc. The Defendants plead and rely upon the allegations in the Statement of Claim in the First Action in defense of this action.</P>
<P>19. In September, 2010, Justice Roberts, of the Superior Court of Justice, granted Schembri's motion and appointed a receiver over the Triumph Subsidiaries as a result of the improper wrongful and fraudulent conduct of Way and his corporations. Way refused to provide financing for the Triumph Lands of guarantee financing so as to enable the redevelopment to proceed. In this regard, Way <UNDER>fundamentally</UNDER> breached the Shareholders' Agreement. Accordingly, as a result of Way's breaches, within the receivership proceedings the Commercial Court in Toronto ordered a two phase sales process for the lands owned by the Triumph Subsidiaries.</P>
<P>20. The first phase of the Court ordered sales process enabled both Way and Schembri to deliver to the Receiver sealed offers for the acquisition of any or all of the Triumph Lands pursuant to strict timelines. In the event that the Receiver did not recommend acceptance of any offer to the Court, then phase two of the sales process would be triggered which involved the marketing and sale of the Triumph Lands on the open market.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>359 King Street Waterloo subject to prior Court proceedings</TI>
<P>21. As indicated above, within the receivership proceeding, there was hotly contested litigation with respect to the sales process to be undertaken by the Court appointed receiver with respect to the properties owned by Triumph Subsidiaries.</P>
<P>22. The 359 King Street property was owned by 359 King Ontario Inc. a Triumph subsidiary. This property formed part of the sales process litigation. Justice Mesbur of the Commercial Court, in the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, made a Sales Process order which was on consent.</P>
<P>23. Schembri and his corporate entities complied with the sales process order and rendered an offer to purchase 359 King Street within the timeline contemplated by the Court ordered process. Way did not abide by the sales process order.</P>
<P>24. The Court appointed receiver recommended acceptance of Schembri's offer to acquire 359 King Street. In response, Way and his corporate entities brought a motion seeking a court order discharging the Court appointed receiver.</P>
<P>25. Thereafter, Way made an offer to purchase 359 King Street from the receiver, well outside the timelines established by the Sales Process order and at a price greater than that offered by Schembri.</P>
<P>26. Way then entered into an agreement with the Receiver whereby Way agreed to withdraw his motion seeking an order discharging the Court appointed receiver in exchange for the receiver agreeing to recommend to the Court acceptance of Way's out of time offer to purchase, inter alia, 359 King Street.</P>
<P>27. Although critical of Way's behaviour, Justice Mesbur nevertheless granted an order approving the receiver's decision to sell 359 King Street to Way and/or his corporations.</P>
<P>28. Schembri appealed Justice Mesbur's order to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Ontario Court of Appeal overturned Justice Mesbur's order and ordered that the Receiver sell 359 King Street to Schembri or his corporate entities. The Court of Appeal was critical of Way's behavior during the sales process.</P>
<P>29. Ultimately, pursuant to an order by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the lands owned by the Triumph Subsidiaries were sold pursuant to a Court ordered sale process. Pursuant to the Order of the Ontario Court of Appeal Schembri or his corporate entities were awarded the right to purchase 359 King Street, in Waterloo Ontario. This is the property that forms part of the Plaintiff's complaint in the within action as particularized in paragraphs <UNDER>24&ndash;31</UNDER> of the <UNDER>Fresh as Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim. Ultimately King and Columbia Inc., a Schembri corporation, acquired title to 359 King St.</P>
<P>30. Accordingly, in accordance with the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Receiver, with Court Approval, obtained a vesting order and completed the sale of 359 King Street to Schembri's corporate entity, being King &amp; Columbia Inc.</P>
<P>31. The vesting order by its express terms precludes the Plaintiffs from asserting any action with respect to the Defendants' acquisition of 359 King Street.</P>
<P>32. King &amp; Columbia Inc. acquired 359 King Street pursuant to a Court ordered sales process and the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the vesting order. This acquisition was hotly contested by Way and his corporate entities.</P>
<P>33. During the Court ordered sales process, the proceedings before the Court of Appeal and the motion for the vesting order, Way never raised the Non-Competition Provision as entitling him to in any way participate in the acquisition of 359 King Street.</P>
<P>34. The Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs are estopped from asserting any claim whatsoever with respect to 359 King Street by reason of the aforesaid Court proceedings, the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the vesting order.</P>
<P>35. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Plaintiffs have asserted a claim against the Defendants alleging conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duties by reason of the acquisition of 359 King Street pursuant to the aforesaid Court proceedings in the First Action.</P>
<P>36. The Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs could have acquired 359 King Street had they complied with the Court ordered sales process and not abused the process of the Court as was found by the Ontario Court of Appeal and Justice Mesbur.</P>
<P>37. The Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs are attempting a collateral attack on the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the vesting order by asserting a claim in relation to 359 King Street.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Columbia St.</TI>
<P>38. 41 Columbia St. was first under contract by Schembri in 2009 while Way and Schembri were still partners. Way attended at the site and walked the property. Way was advised by Schembri that Schembri intended to construct student housing on the site. Way advised Schembri that he had no interest in the property. Way also knew that Schembri was intending to acquire other properties within the vicinity of the universities and develop same as student housing.</P>
<P>39. Way advised Schembri that he had no interest in any acquisition or development of student housing in Waterloo Region. In fact, Triumph Financial or another Way entity had entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with respect to 61 Columbia St. Since Way had no interest in developing property on Columbia St. or in student housing he assigned the Agreement of Purchase and Sale to one of Schembri's corporate entities. Ultimately Schembri acquired 61 Columbia St. and constructed student housing thereon.</P>
<P>40. To Way's knowledge, Schembri, through his corporate entities, has acquired and developed student housing at 26, 35, 41, 61, 69 and 75 Columbia St.</P>
<P>41. Way was fully aware of Schembri's acquisition of these properties and the development of student housing thereon. In fact, as set out above, Way's corporate entity voluntarily assigned an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with respect to 61 Columbia St. to Schembri's corporate entity.</P>
<P>42. Accordingly, these Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs have no interest whatsoever with respect to any development by Schembri or his corporate entities in Waterloo, given the foregoing, and Way's express advice that he was not at all interested in pursuing student housing in the region of Waterloo.</P>
<P>43. <UNDER>The Plaintiffs are estopped from asserting their claim.</UNDER></P>
<P>44. <UNDER>The Plaintiffs' claim was asserted more than two years after they became aware that the Columbia properties were acquired and accordingly they are statute barred.</UNDER></P>
<P>45. <UNDER>The Defendants allege that the properties acquired by The Block Inc., The Block I Inc. and The Block II Inc. (the &ldquo;Block Properties&rdquo;) were acquired for purpose of development and construction of student housing. As set out above, the Plaintiffs have no interest in the Block Properties by reason of the fact that they are to be developed for student housing. The Non-Competition provision of the Shareholders Agreement (which terms defined below) while unenforceable on its own, does not, in any event, relate or affect any real estate development opportunity involving student housing.</UNDER></P>
<P>46. <UNDER>Furthermore, the Block Properties were acquired after:</UNDER>
<P1>(a) <UNDER>Way breached the JVA;</UNDER></P1>
<P1>(b) <UNDER>Way defrauded Schembri and his corporations;</UNDER></P1>
<P1>(c) <UNDER>The Triumph Subsidiaries were placed into receivership;</UNDER></P1>
<P1>(d) <UNDER>The relationship, both contractual and otherwise, as between Way and Schembri was irrevocably destroyed.</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>47. <UNDER>The Block Corporations owed no duty to the Plaintiffs as alleged and entered no conspiracy as alleged.</UNDER></P>
<P>48. <UNDER>5 Rittenhouse Inc. owes no duty to the Plaintiffs and entered into no conspiracy. The Plaintiffs have no claim with respect to any property owned by 5 Rittenhouse Inc.</UNDER></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Shareholders Agreement</TI>
<P>49. By reason of the conduct of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants in the First Action, the Defendants allege that the Non-Competition Provision is not binding. The Plaintiffs have committed fundamental breaches of the Shareholder Agreement. As a result they cannot rely on Article 13 of the Shareholders Agreement.</P>
<P>50. Furthermore, there has been a fundamental and irrevocable destruction of the relationship between Way and Schembri and their respective corporations. It is inconceivable that they could or should ever be involved in any business venture together.</P>
<P>51. In this regard the Defendants allege that the Non-Competition Provision was predicated upon all parties acting in good faith and in compliance with their contractual and common law duties.</P>
<P>52. The Plaintiffs breached their contractual and common law duties owed to the Defendants and accordingly cannot rely upon or enforce the Non-Competition Provision.</P>
<P>53. Article 13 of the Shareholders Agreement is unenforceable.</P>
<P>54. The Non-competition Agreement, in its entirety, provides as follows:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N><EM>13</EM>.</N><TI><EM>NON-COMPETITION</EM></TI>
<P><EM>During the period which SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL is a shareholder of the Corporation, it shall have the ongoing obligation to present to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This obligation to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall also extend to GORDON SCHEMBRI personally and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise. KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible using the typical budget model consistency utilized by them in such circumstances and, if at the expiry of the FIFTEEN (15) day period neither of them have indicated to SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL in writing that it is taking on the Project, then SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL (or its designate) shall be free to pursue the Project without the involvement of KINGSLEY FINANCIAL or the Corporation</EM>.</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE>
<P1>Shareholders Agreement, para. 13, p. 17.</P1></P>
<P>55. The Non-Competition provision is not enforceable for the following reasons:
<P1>(a) The Non-Competition provision has no temporal limits. It states that during the period which Schembri Financial is a shareholder of the Triumph Financial, it is bound by the Non-competition covenant. However, Schembri Financial cannot divest itself of the shares it owns in Triumph Financial without the consent of Way. Way can withhold his consent.</P1>
<P1>(b) The Shareholders Agreement is only terminated if Schembri and Way consent in writing.</P1>
<P1>(c) Accordingly, Way, and Way alone, can determine when and if Schembri Financial can cease to be a shareholder of Triumph Financial or when the Shareholders Agreement will terminate.</P1>
<P1>(d) The Defendants allege that a Non-competition provision that has no finite time limit is unreasonable and unenforceable as it is not necessary to protect the legitimate commercial interest of the party for whose benefit the Non-competition provision applies.</P1>
<P1>(e) There appears to be an obligation on Schembri Financial to &ldquo;present&rdquo; real estate development opportunities it may have acquired in Waterloo. The Agreement does not stipulate what had to be &ldquo;presented&rdquo; or for that matter disclosed or whether Way was required to compensate Schembri for such disclosure.</P1>
<P1>(f) The Non-Competition provision provides an ongoing obligation on Schembri Financial to present to <UNDER>both</UNDER> Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. Accordingly, the obligation is on Schembri Financial to present such opportunities to two entities. Either, none or both could accept. There is no mechanism or provision to determine what would occur if both Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial advised that they were &ldquo;taking on the Project&rdquo;. There is no mechanism or provision to determine;
<P2>(i) What their involvement would be;</P2>
<P2>(ii) The percentage of their interests;</P2>
<P2>(iii) The requirement of each or both to fund;</P2>
<P2>(iv) The role of each or either or both of them; and</P2>
<P2>(v) The role, involvement or ownership interest of Schembri.</P2></P1>
<P1>(g) The obligation is triggered when a real estate development is acquired. However, &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; is not a defined term. It could mean a variety of things, for example:
<P2>(i) When Schembri became aware of a property's existence;</P2>
<P2>(ii) When Schembri made an offer to purchase a property;</P2>
<P2>(iii) When an offer to purchase was accepted;</P2>
<P2>(iv) When an offer to purchase became firm;</P2>
<P2>(v) When the property was purchased and closed.</P2></P1>
<P1>(h) The Non-Competition provision provides that this &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; extends to Schembri personally and &ldquo;any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financial or otherwise&rdquo;. The Non-competition provision therefore purports to bind non-parties to the Shareholders Agreement. This is not enforceable. Furthermore, the term &ldquo;financial or otherwise&rdquo; is not defined and is ambiguous and incapable of enforcement. Furthermore, the Non-competition provision appears to bind, by way of example, a publicly traded corporation if Schembri owned a share in it. This is not enforceable; it is too broad, it is unnecessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the Plaintiffs.</P1>
<P1>(i) The Non-Competition provision provides that Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial have 15 days following the &ldquo;presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances&rdquo;. With respect to this:
<P2>(i) The presentation of the &ldquo;Project&rdquo; would be the &ldquo;Project&rdquo; that Schembri Financial or Schembri, or any other legal entity in which Schembri has an interest, directly or indirectly, financial or otherwise, had already acquired. The Project could be any type of real estate development opportunity, such as a lease, purchase or lease of vacant land, or farm land or zoned land of any nature, or type or use and for any purpose.</P2>
<P2>(ii) Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial are required to use the &ldquo;typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances&rdquo; in order to determine if the Project is economically feasible. However, there is no typical budget model consistently utilized by Triumph Financial or Kingsley Financial in existence. There is no typical budget model in existence. Triumph Financial has never had a typical budget model and never had a budget that was approved in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement.</P2>
<P2>(iii) Kingsley Financial has never had a typical budget model or budget model.</P2>
<P2>(iv) The only budget in which Schembri and Way were involved was with respect to 345 King Street. That was the budget that gave rise to the First Action by reason of Way's fraudulent manipulation of the budget and his fraudulent conduct in connection therewith.</P2>
<P2>(v) Even aside the fact that there are no typical budget models consistently utilized by Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial or any typical budget models at all, the term &ldquo;in such circumstances&rdquo; is impossible to define. As stated above, the Non-competition provision purports to apply to all real estate development opportunities. Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial have no typical budget models for &ldquo;such circumstances&rdquo;.</P2></P1>
<P1>(j) The Non-Competition provision goes on to state that at the expiry of 15 days if &ldquo;neither of them (Kingsley Financial and/or Triumph Financial) have indicated to Schembri Financial in writing that it is taking on the Project&rdquo; then Schembri Financial can pursue the Project without their involvement. The Non-Competition provision does not set out what &ldquo;taking on the Project&rdquo; means. It does not set out:
<P2>(i) Whether Kingsley Financial and/or Triumph Financial would develop the Project in partnership with Schembri Financial or as a joint venture, or as a limited partnership, or as a co-tenancy;</P2>
<P2>(ii) Whether Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial would take over 100% of the Project, and if so, for what price;</P2>
<P2>(iii) What would happen if both Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial decided to take on the project;</P2>
<P2>(iv) Whether the entities, being Triumph Financial, Kingsley Financial and Schembri, would own equal percentages or some other division, or what such divisions would be based upon;</P2>
<P2>(v) Who would fund the Project;</P2>
<P2>(vi) Who would provide the guarantees for the Project;</P2>
<P2>(vii) How Schembri Financial be compensated for its equity and time spent in acquiring the Project;</P2>
<P2>(viii) How Schembri Financial would be compensated in the event that it enhanced the value of the underlying real estate development by way of an assembly and re-zoning of property; and</P2>
<P2>(ix) What &ldquo;taking on the Project&rdquo; means or how it would be done.</P2></P1>
<P1>(k) Pursuant to the provisions of the Shareholders Agreement, Way cannot unilaterally make decisions on behalf of Triumph Financial with respect to matters relating to land acquisition, mortgage financing, construction budgets, and project feasibility, or decide to encumber Triumph Financial's assets, or commit to any financing arrangements with third parties, or undertake any project without project feasibility and construction budget approvals, all of which require the consent of Schembri Financial. It is impossible to determine how the Non-Competition provisions and the other conflicting provisions of the Shareholders Agreement would be reconciled.</P1>
<P1>(l) The Non-Competition provision is not necessary to protect the Plaintiffs' legitimate business and commercial interests.</P1>
<P1>(m) The Non-Competition provision makes no commercial or logical sense. In this regard, the Non-Competition provision does not address:
<P2>(i) Why the parties would agree that Schembri would be free to expend, what would be considerable time, effort and capital to acquire, assemble and re-zone a project only to potentially have Triumph Financial or Kingsley Financial advise in writing that it or they are &ldquo;taking on the Project&rdquo;;</P2>
<P2>(ii) Whether Schembri would be excluded from the development of a project if Kingsley Financial decided to &ldquo;take it on&rdquo;;</P2>
<P2>(iii) Whether Schembri Financial would be compensated if they did this, what compensation would be provided or whether or not compensation is even required;</P2>
<P2>(iv) Whether Schembri Financial would continue having an interest and if so, on what basis and in what percentage. For example, if Schembri Financial agreed that Triumph Financial would take on the Project and Kingsley Financial also wanted to take on the Project, the provision does not allow any determination of the division of ownership and profits or responsibility for liability;</P2></P1>
<P1>(n) The Non-Competition provision indicates that if the required written notice is not provided then Schembri Financial can proceed with the Project &ldquo;without the involvement of Kingsley Financial or the Corporation&rdquo;. However, nowhere in the Non-competition provision does it set out what, if any, involvement Kingsley Financial and/or the Corporation (Triumph Financial) would have in the Project had they provided written notice.</P1></P>
<P>56. Schembri Financial's and Schembri's main business is the development of student housing, primarily in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. The Plaintiffs are not in that business. Accordingly, the Defendants are not competing with the Plaintiffs in any event.</P>
<P>57. The Defendants also allege that Way, as corporate entities, have ceased any activity in the real estate development business. Way is preparing to retire and in the process of divesting himself of his real estate assets. Such assets are currently for sale. Accordingly, the Non-competition provision provides no benefit to Way or his corporate entities, given his decision to withdraw from the business.</P>
<P>58. As a result of the Receivership proceedings in the First Action, Triumph Financial is effectively not carrying on any business. Way has committed material breaches of the shareholders Agreement and accordingly cannot rely on it in support of this claim.</P>
<P>59. The Defendants deny that they have breached any contract with the Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>60. The Defendants deny that they have converted or misappropriated any monies.</P>
<P>61. The Defendants deny they owe any fiduciary duty to any of the Plaintiffs and, in the alternative, that they have breached any such fiduciary duty.</P>
<P>62. The Defendants have not entered into any conspiracy.</P>
<P>63. The Defendants deny that the Plaintiffs have suffered any damages and put the Plaintiffs to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>71. The Plaintiffs' action is statute barred and the Defendants rely upon the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> of Ontario in this regard.</P>
<P>72. The Defendants therefore allege that the within action should be dismissed with costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</P>

<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF MOTION (returnable September 21, 2016)</TI>
<P>The plaintiffs (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way&rdquo;</BOLD>) will make a motion before Mr. Justice Sloan on September 21, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. or as soon after that time as the motion can be heard at the court house at 85 Frederick Street, Kitchener, Ontario, N2H 0A7.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The motion is to be heard orally.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> A hearing together with a parallel motion in a related action bearing Court File No. CV-42-12 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;</BOLD>);</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> An Order:
<P1>(a) directing the defendants to deliver a further and better affidavit of documents;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring the defendant, Gordon Schembri (<BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;</BOLD>) to attend an examination for discovery from November 28 to December 16, 2016, inclusive in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action;</P1>
<P1>(c) prohibiting the defendants from bringing a motion for summary judgment, in whole or in part;</P1>
<P1>(d) requiring Schembri to reimburse Way forthwith for his legal fees and disbursements incurred during the period from April 3 to September 4, 2014, inclusive;</P1>
<P1>(e) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis payable forthwith; and</P1>
<P1>(f) such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court deem just.</P1></P>
<P>3. The motion has been necessitated by the bully litigation tactics that Schembri has engaged in over many years, including, among other things, deceiving Way and the Court by representing repeatedly for several months that he was bringing a motion for summary judgement in the this proceeding (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;</BOLD>), which caused unnecessary in both the Main Action and this action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;</BOLD>);</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<P>4. Schembri commenced the Main Action in Toronto in February, 2010;</P>
<P>5. The Main Action was transferred to Kitchener in 2011;</P>
<P>6. Schembri amended the Statement of Claim in the Main Action in 2012 and again in 2013;</P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> Presently in the Main Action, Schembri and his companies are claiming relief including damages exceeding $90 million;</P>
<P><BOLD>8.</BOLD> The Main Action is defended;</P>
<P><BOLD>9.</BOLD> In addition, Way asserts a counterclaim, in part, to the effect that Schembri breached a shareholders' agreement by failing to comply with the right of first refusal provisions contained therein (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Provisions&rdquo;</BOLD>) so as to allow Way to participate in the acquisition and development of other properties located in Waterloo;</P>
<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> Schembri's breach of the ROFR Provisions are now the subject matter of the ROFR Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> There are orders, on consent, in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action that these actions are to be tried together;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Documentary Disclosure</TI>
<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> Way swore an affidavit of documents on February 27, 2014.</P>
<P><BOLD>13.</BOLD> Counsel for Way notified Wortzman counsel for Schembri on February 20, 2014 of the types of documents Way expected Schembri to produce.</P>
<P><BOLD>14.</BOLD> Schembri swore an affidavit of documents on September 30, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri AoD&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P><BOLD>15.</BOLD> The Schembri AoD ignored the outline set out in Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; and, for the most part, lists court documents in the Main Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>16.</BOLD> Of note, Schembri did not even list the agreements of purchase and sale for the properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action (which would reveal the dates on which Schembri offered to purchase the properties);</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Deception</TI>
<P><BOLD>17.</BOLD> Counsel for Way made extensive efforts, unsuccessfully, over several months to conclude an agreement with Schembri in respect of numerous procedural matters in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>18.</BOLD> During the course of those extensive efforts, counsel for Schembri represented that Schembri would be bringing the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>19.</BOLD> Consequently, Way caused motions to be brought in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action for various relief, including another revised timetable in the Main Action and a timetable in connection with the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>20.</BOLD> Despite suggesting otherwise, Schembri did not serve any responding materials or conduct any cross-examination, and the orders in the Main Action and the ROFR Action were issued on consent</P>
<P><BOLD>21.</BOLD> By Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Timetable Order&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Court, among other things, imposed a timetable for the conduct of the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, including the requirement that the motion record had to be served on or before September 30, 2014;</P>
<P><BOLD>22.</BOLD> The timetable in Main Action (for the examinations for discovery) had to accommodate the timetable for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion (including the cross-examinations in connection therewith);</P>
<P><BOLD>23.</BOLD> Schembri breached the ROFR Timetable Order by failing to serve his motion record by September 30, 2014;</P>
<P><BOLD>24.</BOLD> Notwithstanding his breach, Schembri continued to represent he would be bringing the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>25.</BOLD> Schembri deceived Way and this Honourable Court for the purpose of avoiding his examination for discovery in the Main Action and increasing the amount of costs being incurred by Way;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Examinations for Discovery</TI>
<P><BOLD>26.</BOLD> Way has been examined for thirteen days over five months, and completed his examination for discovery on April 30, 2015, subject to answers to his undertakings.</P>
<P><BOLD>27.</BOLD> Way was asked more than 12,000 questions and gave nearly 600 undertakings;</P>
<P><BOLD>28.</BOLD> On or about the eleventh day of the examination for discovery of Way, counsel for Schembri began asking questions about the ROFR Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>29.</BOLD> This was unexpected because of Schembri's repeated representations about the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, and the fact that the Notice of Examination served on December 22, 2014 related to the Main Action only;</P>
<P><BOLD>30.</BOLD> Consequently, Way seeks an Order:
<P1>(a) directing the defendants to deliver a further and better affidavit of documents;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring Schembri to attend an examination for discovery from November 28 to December 16, 2016, inclusive in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action;</P1>
<P1>(c) prohibiting the defendants from bringing a motion for summary judgment, in whole or in part;</P1>
<P1>(d) requiring Schembri to reimburse Way forthwith for his legal fees and disbursements incurred during the period from April 3 to September 4, 2014, inclusive;</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>31.</BOLD> Rules 1.04, 1.05, 30, 31, 37, 60.12 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>; and</P>
<P><BOLD>32.</BOLD> Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of motion:</P>
<P><BOLD>33.</BOLD> The affidavit of Alven J. Way sworn September 16, 2016; and</P>
<P><BOLD>34.</BOLD> Such further and other evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF ALVEN J. WAY (sworn September 16, 2016)</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, ALVEN J. WAY,</BOLD> businessman, of the City of Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario, make oath and say as follows.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Preliminary Comments</TI>
<P>1. I am a plaintiff, and a director of each of the corporate plaintiffs, in this proceeding (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;</BOLD>), and a defendant, plaintiff by counterclaim in a related action bearing Court File No Court File No. C-42-11 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;</BOLD>). As such, I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to herein except where knowledge of such facts is stated to be on information and belief and, where so stated, I verily believe those facts to be true.</P>
<P>2. This affidavit is sworn in support of a motion for an order:
<P1>(a) directing the defendants to deliver a further and better affidavit of documents;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring the defendant, Gordon Schembri (<BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;</BOLD>) to attend an examination for discovery from November 28 to December 16, 2016, inclusive in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action;</P1>
<P1>(c) prohibiting the defendants from bringing a motion for summary judgment, in whole or in part;</P1>
<P1>(d) requiring Schembri to reimburse Way forthwith for his legal fees and disbursements incurred during the period from April 3 to September 4, 2014, inclusive; and</P1>
<P1>(e) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis payable forthwith.</P1></P>
<P>3. This motion has been necessitated by the bully litigation tactics that Schembri has engaged in over many years, including, among other things, deceiving me, my counsel and the Court by representing repeatedly for several months that he was bringing a motion for summary judgement in the ROFR Action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Background</TI>
<P>4. Schembri commenced the Main Action in Toronto in February, 2010. I caused the Main Action to be transferred to Kitchener in 2011. Schembri has been represented throughout by James Wortz man (<BOLD>&ldquo;Wortzman&rdquo;</BOLD>) at Teplitsky, Colson LLP.</P>
<P>5. Schembri has amended the Statement of Claim in the Main Action on two separate occasions. Presently in the Main Action, Schembri and his companies are claiming relief including damages exceeding $90 million.</P>
<P>6. The Main Action is defended. I (along with my companies) am represented by Heath Whiteley (<BOLD>&ldquo;Whiteley&rdquo;</BOLD>), formerly of Gowlings LLP in Toronto and now a sole practitioner. Whiteley has been involved in the Main Action since the fall of 2010.</P>
<P>7. In addition to defending the Main Action, I have asserted a counterclaim, initially in part, to the effect that Schembri breached the Shareholder Agreement by failing to comply with the right of first refusal provisions contained therein (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Provisions&rdquo;</BOLD>) so as to allow me to participate in the acquisition and development of other properties located in Waterloo.</P>
<P>8. The damages suffered by me resulting from Schembri's breach of the ROFR Provisions subsequently became the subject matter of the ROFR Action.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Documentary Disclosure</TI>
<P>9. I swore an affidavit of documents on February 27, 2014.</P>
<P>10. I was informed by Cole and believed that he notified Wortzman on February 20, 2014 of the types of documents we expected Schembri to produce. A copy of an email sent February 20, 2014 setting out an outline of the types of documents is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>11. Schembri swore an affidavit of documents on September 30, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri AoD&rdquo;</BOLD>). A copy of the Schembri AoD is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>12. The Schembri AoD ignored the outline set out in Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; and, for the most part, lists court documents in the Main Action. Of note, Schembri did not even list the agreements of purchase and sale for the properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action. These agreements would reveal the dates on which Schembri offered to purchase the properties.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The ROFR Timetable Order (Sept/14)</TI>
<P>13. Cliff Cole (<BOLD>&ldquo;Cole&rdquo;</BOLD>), a lawyer at Gowlings LLP in Toronto, and Whiteley made extensive efforts, unsuccessfully, over several months to conclude an agreement with Schembri in respect of numerous procedural matters in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action as reflected in the correspondence exchanged between them and Wortzman as follows:

<P1>A copy of the foregoing correspondence is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. I was informed by Cole and believed that he and Wortzman agreed that discoveries in the Main Action would be held in July and August, 2014. I then set aside those dates in my calendar and arranged for my absence from my business.</P>
<P>15. I was also informed by Cole and believed that Wortzman represented that Schembri would be bringing the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion.</P>
<P>16. I have reviewed the correspondence attached hereto and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; and note the following:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI>Wortzman's letter dated May 26, 2014</TI>
<P><EM>We have instructions now to bring a motion for summary judgment seeking a dismissal of [the ROFR Action]</EM>.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><EM>Our motion for summary judgement can be served within the next two or three weeks. Accordingly, if Ms. Gupta can advise as to a potential return date we can agree upon a timetable for that motion</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Wortzman's letter dated June 4, 2014</TI>
<P><EM>I will endeavour to serve our Motion Record regarding summary judgment...by June 20, 2014. Once that Motion Record is served we will discuss how long you need to file responding material and the timetable required for the motion</EM>.</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>17. I have also reviewed the letter from Wortzman dated July 9, 2014 (after my counsel served the motion record that led to the ROFR Timetable Order (defined in paragraph 21 below)), and note that Wortzman represented he was &ldquo;<EM>finalizing the motion record for partial summary judgment&rdquo;</EM>. A copy of the letter dated July 9, 2014 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>18. As a result of my counsel's extensive efforts being unsuccessful, I caused motions to be brought in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action for various relief, including another revised timetable in the Main Action and a timetable in connection with the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion.</P>
<P>19. Despite suggesting otherwise, Schembri did not serve any responding materials or conduct any cross-examination, and the orders in the Main Action and the ROFR Action were issued on consent.</P>
<P>20. By Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 in the Main Action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action Timetable Order&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Court, among other things, scheduled the examinations for discovery to be conducted on December 9 to 19, 2014, inclusive, and January 12 to 16, 2015, inclusive. I set aside those dates in my calendar and arranged for my absence from my business. A copy of the Main Action Timetable Order is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>21. By Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Timetable Order&rdquo;</BOLD>), the Court, among other things, imposed a timetable in paragraph 5 for the conduct of the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, including the requirement that the motion record had to be served on or before September 30, 2014. A copy of the ROFR Timetable Order is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>22. The timetable in the Main Action (for the examinations for discovery) had to accommodate the timetable for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion (including the cross-examinations in connection therewith).</P>
<P>23. Schembri breached the ROFR Timetable Order by failing to serve his motion record by September 30, 2014.</P>
<P>24. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that Cole followed up with Wortzman, who responded on October 20, 2014 that his <EM>&ldquo;instructions are to proceed with a motion for summary judgment in the ROFR action&rdquo;</EM>. A copy of the correspondence between Cole and Wortzman in this regard is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>25. But for Schembri's deception, the examinations for discovery in the Main Action would have been scheduled to start in July, 2014. I believe that Schembri perpetrated this deception for the purpose of avoiding his examination for discovery (thereby delaying the Main Action and the ROFR Action) and increasing the amount of costs being incurred by me in defending myself and my companies.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>My Examination for Discovery</TI>
<P>26. My examination for discovery in the Main Action commenced on December 15, 2014. Wortzman examined me for thirteen days over five months, and completed his examination for discovery on April 30, 2015. The last three days of my examination were all on dates requested by Wortzman and accommodated by me and my counsel. A copy of the correspondence evidencing such accommodation is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>27. On or about the eleventh day of my examination for discovery, Wortzman began asking me questions about the ROFR Action. I did not expect him to do so because of his repeated representations about the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, and the fact that the Notice of Examination he served on December 22, 2014 related to the Main Action only. I believe this is just another example of Schembri's bully litigation tactics. A copy of this notice of examination is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>Relief Sought</TI>
<P>28. I believe the deficient documentary disclosure by Schembri warrants the relief sought in paragraph 2 (a). I further believe the extensive delay and the deceit perpetrated by Schembri warrants the relief sought in paragraph 2 (b), (c), (d) and (e).</P>
<P>29. I swear this affidavit for the purpose stated in paragraph 2 above, and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<P>The Defendants will make a Motion to Mr. Justice Sloan at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be fixed by the Trial Co-ordinator, or as soon after that time as the Motion can be heard at the court house, 85 Frederick Street, Kitchener, Ontario, N2H 0A7.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The Motion is to be heard
<P1>[ ] in writing under subrule 37.12.1(1) because it is;</P1>
<P1>[ ] in writing as an opposed motion under subrule 37.12.1(4);</P1>
<P1>[X] orally.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THIS MOTION IS FOR</BOLD>
<P1>(a) An Order for summary judgment dismissing the within action;</P1>
<P1>(b) A declaration that Article 13 of the Agreement (as hereinafter defined) is unenforceable and is of no force and effect;</P1>
<P1>(c) In the alternative, partial summary judgment dismissing the within action as against any one or more of the Defendants;</P1>
<P1>(d) An order that any transcript of any cross-examinations of any party be treated for all purposes as a transcript of an Examination for Discovery at the trial of this action in the event this motion is dismissed;</P1>
<P1>(e) In the alternative, an order bifurcating the within proceeding so that the trial on the issue of liability proceeds first and if successful the issue of damages be heard along with an order bifurcating the discoveries and productions;</P1>
<P1>(f) In the alternative an order dismissing the action as against King &amp; Columbia Inc. and striking all reference to that property from the Statement of Claim;</P1>
<P1>(g) The costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis, plus any and all applicable taxes; and</P1>
<P1>(h) Such further and other relief as lawyers may advise and this Honourable Court deem just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background:</TI>
<P><P1>(a) The Defendant, Gordon Schembri (&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;), is an individual residing in the City of Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Corporate Defendants are corporations incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and are controlled by Schembri;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Plaintiff, Al Way (&ldquo;Way&rdquo;), is an individual residing in the City of Kitchener, in the Province of Ontario;</P1>
<P1>(d) Kingsley Financial Inc. (&ldquo;Kingsley Financial&rdquo;) is a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario. Way owns and controls 100% of Kingsley Financial and is an officer and director of Kingsley Financial;</P1>
<P1>(e) Triumph Financial Inc. (&ldquo;Triumph Financial&rdquo;) is a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Shareholders' Agreement:</TI>
<P><P1>(f) On or about April 2, 2008, Kingsley Financial, Schembri Financial, Triumph Financial, Way, and Schembri entered into a Shareholders' Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) with respect to the shares of Triumph Financial;</P1>
<P1>(g) At the time of the Agreement, 100 Common shares of the authorized capital of Triumph Financial were issued, with Kingsley Financial holding 55 Common shares and Schembri Financial holding 45 Common Shares;</P1>
<P1>(h) Pursuant to the Agreement, the Board of Directors consists of two directors, being Way and Schembri or their respective nominees until such time as one or more of them ceased to be a shareholder of Triumph Financial;</P1>
<P1>(i) Pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Agreement, shares cannot be transferred without the consent of the shareholders representing not less than 100 hundred per cent of the voting shares of the capital stock of Triumph Financial;</P1>
<P1>(j) The Agreement also contains a right of first refusal or non-competition clause at Article 13 (the &ldquo;Non-Compete Clause&rdquo;), which states:
<QUOTE><P><EM>During the period which SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL is a shareholder of the Corporation</EM> [Triumph Financial], <EM>it shall have the ongoing obligation to present to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This obligation to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall also extend to GORDON SCHEMBRI personally and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise. KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances and, if at the expiry of the FIFTEEN (15) day period neither of them have indicated to SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL in writing that it is taking on the Project, then SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL (or its designate) shall be free to pursue the Project without the involvement of KINGSLEY FINANCIAL or the Corporation</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Alleged Breaches:</TI>
<P><P1>(k) The Plaintiffs allege that Schembri Financial and Schembri have breached the terms of the Agreement by conspiring with the Corporate Defendants to purchase and develop various properties without first presenting the opportunities to Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Relief Sought by the Plaintiffs for the Alleged Breaches:</TI>
<P><P1>(l) The Plaintiffs claim for:
<P2>(i) damages in the amount of $30,000,000 for breach of contract, conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty, and conspiracy in connection with certain transactions pertaining to various properties;</P2>
<P2>(ii) a declaration that various properties are held by the Defendants by a constructive trust for the Plaintiffs, or any of them;</P2>
<P2>(iii) an accounting of all profits and other benefits derived by the Defendants or any of them in connection with the acquisition and development of the Lands (the &ldquo;Accounting&rdquo;);</P2>
<P2>(iv) an order directing the Defendants to pay to the Plaintiffs all amounts found owing to them pursuant to the Accounting; and</P2>
<P2>(v) punitive, aggravated, and exemplary damages in the amount of $500,000;</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Non-Compete Clause is Unenforceable</TI>
<P><P1>(m) As a result of the wrongful actions of Way, a Receiver was appointed by Court Order of all of the assets, undertakings and properties of Oxford &amp; First Street Inc., Simcoe &amp; Eastwood Ave. Inc. and 359 King Ontario Inc., being the Triumph Subsidiaries and representing all of Triumph's assets. Triumph no longer carries on business. In essence the Receiver has stepped into the shoes of Triumph Financial. The Receivership has effectively terminated the shareholder's Agreement or at the very least the Non-Compete Clause;</P1>
<P1>(n) The Non-Compete Clause is ambiguous with respect to the obligations it purports to impose on Schembri Financial and Schembri personally. Accordingly, it is unenforceable;</P1>
<P1>(o) Additionally, the duration of the Non-Compete Clause is indefinite or undeterminable. The clause applies during the period in which Schembri Financial is a shareholder of Triumph Financial. However, the Agreement prohibits Schembri Financial from transferring shares without the consent of Way through Kingsley Financial. In effect, Schembri Financial can only cease being a shareholder of Triumph Financial with the consent of Kingsley Financial;</P1>
<P1>(p) Accordingly, the Non-Compete Clause upon which the Plaintiffs are relying is unenforceable due to:
<P2>(i) the ambiguity of the terms;</P2>
<P2>(ii) the unreasonableness of the duration of the restriction. It is endless and purports to bind Schembri's heirs for all time;</P2>
<P2>(iii) the fact that it is too broad;</P2>
<P2>(iv) the inability of a court to enforce its terms;</P2>
<P2>(v) the fact that the Plaintiffs have committed a fraudulent breach of the Agreement;</P2>
<P2>(vi) the fact that it purports to bind persons and entities that are not a party to it. For example if Schembri invested in a publically traded REIT, such REIT would be bound by the Non-Competition Clause;</P2>
<P2>(vii) the fact that it is <EM>prima facie</EM> contrary to public policy; and</P2>
<P2>(viii) the fact that Way has ceased developing real estate in Ontario and has or is in the process of winding down his business;</P2></P1>
<P1>(q) The Non-Compete Clause is too broad, is unreasonable, and is incapable of being understood or enforced;</P1>
<P1>(r) The Non&mdash;Compete Clause is not reasonably necessary for Way to protect his legitimate interests;</P1>
<P1>(s) As the Non-Compete Clause is unenforceable, there is no basis on which the Plaintiffs can claim that Schembri Financial and Schembri breached their duties under the Agreement by failing to present opportunities to Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial;</P1>
<P1>(t) There is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to the within Statement of Claim as it relates to any alleged breaches of the Agreement;</P1>
<P1>(u) The Plaintiffs have committed a fundamental breach of the Shareholder's Agreement and accordingly are estopped from relying upon the non-compete clause;</P1>
<P1>(v) The Plaintiffs have fundamentally breached the Shareholder's Agreement, the Defendants have accepted the Plaintiffs' repudiation and the Shareholder's Agreement is at an end as well as any and all obligations set out therein;</P1>
<P1>(w) The Plaintiffs have committed a fraud against Schembri and Schembri Financial and accordingly are not entitled to any equitable relief;</P1>
<P1>(x) The claims of the Plaintiffs are statute barred;</P1>
<P1>(y) The claims of the Plaintiffs as against King &amp; Columbia Inc. are estopped and constitute a collateral attack on the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and constitute an abuse of the process of this Honourable Court;</P1>
<P1>(z) Schembri and Way have been embroiled in protracted and acrimonious litigation over the last six years. It is impossible for them to work together. Enforcement of the Non-Compete Clause would prevent Schembri from developing real estate in the market he is most familiar because he can never be Way's partner;</P1>
<P1>(aa) Such further and other grounds as are set out in the Affidavit of Gordon Schembri filed in support of this motion;</P1>
<P1>(bb) It is just and reasonable that the issue of liability be heard and determined before any issue of damages is considered as it will save tremendous time and money. The damage issue is extremely complex and ought not to be determined until the enforceability of the clause is determined;</P1>
<P1>(cc) Rules 1.04, 5.05, 30.94(8), 31.06(6) and 20 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(dd) Section 128, 129, and 131 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>; and</P1>
<P1>(ee) Such further and other grounds as the lawyers may advise and this Honourable Court deem just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the Motion <EM>(list the affidavits or other documentary evidence to be relied on)</EM>
<P1>(a) The Affidavit of Gordon Schembri and exhibits attached thereto; and</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF GORDON SCHEMBRI</TI>
<P>I, Gordon Schembri, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a Defendant to this action and a representative of the other Defendants to this action, and, as such, have knowledge of the matters contained in this affidavit, unless advised by others, in which case I have stated the source of my information and do verily believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. The Corporate Defendants are corporations controlled by me.</P>
<P>3. I will be filing in support of the Defendants' motion certain affidavits sworn and filed by me in connection with various interlocutory proceedings that have taken place in an action commenced by me and companies controlled by me against Way and others bearing court file No. C-42-11 (the &ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;). These affidavits will be filed separately and are relied upon to support the relief sought herein and to provide the full factual background that gave rise to the appointment of a Receiver against the Triumph Subsidiaries and the sale of certain properties including 359 King Street Waterloo which is the subject matter of this action.</P>
<P>4. Filed in support of this motion and filed separately are:
<P1>(a) the motion record that the Plaintiffs filed in the Main Action seeking an order, inter alia, for the appointment of a Receiver over the Triumph Subsidiaries, which includes my affidavit sworn May 14, 2010 (&ldquo;May Affidavit&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) a copy of my affidavit sworn September 5, 2010, again in support of a Receivership motion in the Main Action;</P1>
<P1>(c) the motion materials filed by the Plaintiffs in the Main Action wherein an order approving the sale transaction relating to 359 King St. West was sought. That motion material contains a copy of my affidavit sworn June 7, 2011, filed in support of the said motion, together with exhibits;</P1>
<P1>(d) the affidavit of Michael Gayed sworn June 29, 2011, in support of an order staying the order of Master Mesbur pending appeal to the Court of Appeal;</P1>
<P1>(e) my June 7, 2011, affidavit regarding the Sales Process.</P1></P>
<P>[Missing text]
<P1>(a) The Plaintiff, Kingsley Financial Inc. (&ldquo;Kingsley&rdquo;) would own 55% of the shares of Triumph Financial and Schembri Financial would own the remaining 45%;</P1>
<P1>(b) Kingsley received 55% of the said share because it was recognized that Way and his entity would be required to fund and finance any development without contribution from me. Schembri Financial received 45% in recognition of my offer to assemble, acquire and rezone and obtain all required permits for the properties;</P1>
<P1>(c) Each of Way and me, or our respective nominees were directors;</P1>
<P1>(d) Way was president and I was secretary-treasurer;</P1>
<P1>(e) Way, as President, had the ability to sign all contracts on behalf of Triumph Financial, except in respect of matters relating to land acquisition, mortgage financing, construction budgets and project feasibility, which required the signatures of both Way and me or our designates;</P1>
<P1>(f) Each of the directors had one vote and Way, as chairman, did not have any additional or casting vote. Accordingly, if Way and I did not agree, then the board of directors would be deadlocked;</P1>
<P1>(g) Unanimous shareholder approval was required for Triumph Financial:
<P2>(i) to directly or indirectly make any loans or advances, or invest in or give security for, or guarantee the debts of any other Corporation or person;</P2></P1></P>
<P>[Missing text]</P>
<P>19. I or my corporate entities only received $1,400,000.00 from the profits generated by the JVA. I demanded an accounting from Way. I finally received one but it was inaccurate, incomplete and fraudulent. Way refused to provide full and accurate financial disclosure and continues to refuse as of the date of this pleading. To this date, notwithstanding being ordered by this Honourable Court to do so, Way had not done so.</P>
<P>20. As a result I and various corporate entities owned or controlled by me commenced a proceeding against Way and various related corporations owned or controlled by him in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto. This action was subsequently transferred to Kitchener and now bears Court File CV-42-11 (the &ldquo;First Action&rdquo;). In the First Action I and the other Plaintiffs sought significant damages as against Way and his corporations and the appointment of a receiver with respect to Oxford and First St. Inc., Simcoe and Eastwood Ave Inc. and 359 King Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>21. My May 14, 2010, affidavit (the &ldquo;May Affidavit&rdquo;) sets out my position relating to the development of the Triumph Subsidiary lands.</P>
<P>22. When I brought my motion to appoint a Receiver of the Triumph Subsidiaries, Way brought a cross motion seeking an order allowing the subsidiaries to proceed with the development of their lands and that Way have unfettered authority over Triumph Financial and the subsidiaries.</P>
<P>23. I opposed Way's motion as I did not want him to have any discretion or control because he had not respected my prior interest, had improperly misappropriated profits from the Waterloo Lands, improperly co-mingled monies, improperly failed to account for the profits arising from the Waterloo Lands and acted oppressively towards me. He failed to pay me half of the JVA profits. He acted as though he had no partner. He took money from the JVA and gave it to many of his own personal corporations that I had no interest in and Triumph Financial without my consent. He used the money as it was his own not ours.</P>
<P>24. Particulars of my complaints regarding Way are set out in my prior Affidavits.</P>
<P>25. Furthermore, I learned that in the development of the Waterloo Lands Way had improperly utilized corporations owned by him to do work at inflated rates so as to improperly syphon off and misappropriate profits that would have otherwise been paid to me. He also created fictitious invoices to his own corporations for exaggerated amounts for work that was never even done or approved to be done.</P>
<P>26. In this regard, Way committed a fraud against me and deliberately breached the JVA. It was as a result of his improper conduct in the Waterloo Development that I could not permit him to have any control over the development of the Triumph Subsidiary lands located in Oshawa, London and Waterloo.</P>
<P>27. In my April Affidavit I made it clear that I was not opposed to developing the Triumph Lands in the absence of involvement by Way. I stated I was in favour of it. I had done what was required of me. I located, assembled, acquired and rezoned the Lands. It was only fair that Way do what was required of him, which was to finance and/or guarantee the financing of the development. The reason why I did not want Way involved in the actual development is because I had fears that he would continue to misappropriate monies, co-mingle monies, fail to account, inflate invoices, and refuse to provide a proper accounting. This is why I wanted a Receiver involved. I can never be partners with Way again.</P>
<P>28. In fact, my fears came to fruition when Way started to develop the Oshawa property without my consent contrary to the Shareholder's Agreement. I sought an injunction in that regard.</P>
<P>29. It was clear that the relationship between Way and I was irrevocably harmed and damaged and we could no longer work together.</P>
<P>30. As set out in my May Affidavit Way was required to provide all financing for the development of the Triumph Lands. That was his role. My role was to locate, assemble and rezone the lands. Furthermore, through the course of the litigation, it became apparent that Way was already attempting to misappropriate further funds from the Triumph Subsidiaries and had grossly inflated what he represented to the Court as being his carrying costs with respect to those properties. My concerns grew when I saw that Way was attempting to develop the Oshawa Lands without my consent, was utilizing companies owned by him, and was intending to proceed with development at a time when he would not be able to provide occupancy to the students who were intended to be the tenants. Furthermore, he intended to proceed with the development while the municipality was considering altering the density which would significantly enhance the value of the land.</P>
<P>31. It was clear that Way was intent on proceeding notwithstanding what the Shareholder's Agreement said and notwithstanding what my rights were. Again Way was seizing improper control of these developments. I could not work with him. This again resulted in me attempting to have a Receiver appointed to stop Way's breach of the Shareholder's Agreement.</P>
<P>32. All of this is more particularly set out in my May Affidavit.</P>
<P>33. In September, 2010, Justice Roberts, of the Superior Court of Justice, granted my motion and appointed a receiver over the Triumph Subsidiaries as a result of the improper wrongful and fraudulent conduct of Way and his corporations. Way refused to provide financing for the Triumph Lands or guarantee financing so as to enable the redevelopment to proceed. In this regard, Way <UNDER>fundamentally</UNDER> breached the Shareholders' Agreement. Accordingly, as a result of Way's breaches, within the receivership proceedings the Commercial Court in Toronto ordered a two phase sales process for the lands owned by the Triumph Subsidiaries.</P>
<P>34. The first phase of the Court ordered sales process enabled both Way and me to deliver to the Receiver sealed offers for the acquisition of any or all of the Triumph Lands pursuant to strict timelines. In the event that the Receiver did not recommend acceptance of any offer to the Court, then phase two of the sales process would be triggered which involved the marketing and sale of the Triumph Lands on the open market.</P>
<P>35. Justice Roberts made significant findings with respect to the conduct of Way. Justice Roberts made the following findings:
<P1>(a) Having reviewed the extensive evidence submitted by the parties, including the transcripts from the numerous cross-examinations, I agree that, pursuant to Section 101(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, &ldquo;<EM>it would be just and convenient to appoint a Receiver and Manager to undertake the completion of the three real estate projects&rdquo;</EM>.</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>The Plaintiffs have presented a strong prima facie case against Mr. Way and his companies of serious financial and accounting irregularities and improprieties. Indeed, the Defendants have not disputed the evidence provided by the Plaintiffs</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>In particular, the uncontested evidence of Regean Depuis, who had formally been employed by James Way Construction Corporation as the construction manager for the initial Waterloo Project, concerning the Defendants handling of that project, establishes a strong prima facie case that Mr. Way grossly inflated the amounts of various change orders that were charged against the profits of the initial Waterloo project to the benefit of the Defendants and to the detriment of the Plaintiffs. It is significant that, in the first Waterloo project, the vast majority of the work was carried out by Mr. Way's companies which did not tender for the work and over whose expenses and charges there was no independent control</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(d) &ldquo;<EM>Mr. Way added to change orders hundreds of hours for labour that were not expended on the Waterloo project and for the site supervision, scaffolding, heating and other amounts that seemed to have already been included in the fixed price contracts with Mr. Way's companies, and that Mr. Way grossed up each change order with unauthorized and excessive administrative fees. Mr. Depuis' unchallenged evidence was that Mr. Way told him to back charge all of the increased numbers as well as any costs due to overruns and mistakes to Mr. Schembri. Mr. Way admitted on his cross-examination that Mr. Schembri was not shown and therefore did not approve all of the written change orders, contrary to the provisions of their Joint Venture Agreement</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(e) &ldquo;<EM>Further, notwithstanding the requests of the Plaintiffs and their counsel and a court order for production, the Defendants have not provided a full and proper accounting to the Plaintiffs of the initial Waterloo project. As noted below, the Defendants are still resisting the Plaintiff's request for production of relevant financial and documentation and information</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(f) &ldquo;<EM>I agree with the Plaintiffs' submission that the Plaintiffs cannot have confidence in the accounting performed or disclosed by the Defendants. None of the financial statements pertaining to the joint venture is audited and their contents are based on the questionable numbers provided by Mr. Way to his accountants</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(g) &ldquo;<EM>Mr. Way's evidence on cross-examination in response to questions concerning relevant financial information was often incorrect and unhelpful</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(h) &ldquo;<EM>As a particular example, when questioned about the improper transfer of $6 million dollars of joint venture funds to Premier Project Consultants (a Way corporation) and subsidiary corporations, Mr. Way testified that it was the &ldquo;accountants&rdquo; who devised this paper trail; however Mr. Lund (the accountant) testified that he did not advise Mr. Way to transfer the funds in that fashion which had no accounting purpose, but only learned about it after it had been done</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(i) &ldquo;<EM>The evidence that had been produced by Mr. Lund revealed that Mr. Way had apparently improperly transferred funds from the joint venture to pay unrelated payroll expenses and supplies of his other companies, including companies not involved in these projects, over which he has exclusive control</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(j) &ldquo;<EM>I have no hesitation in concluding that the appointment of a Receiver and manager is a remedy necessary to right the wrongs apparently perpetrated by the Defendants</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(k) &ldquo;<EM>The uncontested evidence establishing a strong prima facie case that Mr. Way has an ability that he has already exercised to shuffle money around to numerous corporations over which he has exclusive control. Further, Mr. Way has not been fully compliant with court order production of relevant financial information and documentation to the Plaintiffs, and he seems to be willing to manipulate figures and disregard his accountant's advice</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(l) &ldquo;<EM>As strongly made out by the Plaintiffs unchallenged evidence, in particular, that of Mr. Depuis and Mr. Lund and the financial documentation produced, it appears that Mr. Way's intent on improperly excluding the Plaintiffs and maximizing profits for himself and his companies to the Plaintiffs' detriment</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(m) &ldquo;<EM>Based on the uncontested evidence before me and for the reasons already given, unless a Receiver and manager has the ultimate authority with respect to the monitoring and management of the remaining real estate projects, it is very unlikely that the Defendants will cooperate. Further, none of the remaining projects is &ldquo;shuffle ready&rdquo;; and design and other disputes between the parties mean that the projects are all at a standstill. As a result, this is a convenient juncture for the introduction of a Receiver and manager</EM>.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>36. With respect to costs, Justice Roberts then ordered Way to pay costs of $159,151.25 and granted the Plaintiffs leave to seek costs on a substantial indemnity basis on a further motion.</P>
<P>37. As a result of Justice Roberts' order Schwartz Levitsky Feldman was appointed as Receiver manager. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the Order of Justice Roberts as issued and entered.</P>
<P>38. In the Receivership proceedings in the main action the parties consented to a &ldquo;sales process order&rdquo;. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the order of Justice Mesbur granted within the Receivership proceedings in Commercial Court in Toronto with respect to the sales process.</P>
<P>39. The Plaintiffs consented to the sales process insofar as it related to the London property and 359 King Ontario Inc. property located in Waterloo Ontario. Attached as Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; to Justice Mesbur's order was the sales process. It contemplated two stages. The first was solicitation of offers from Way and me to purchase the properties. In the event that no acceptable offers were received in stage one from Way or myself then the Receiver was to market and sell the properties on the open market.</P>
<P>40. Filed separately in support of this motion is a copy of my affidavit sworn June 7, 2011 (the &ldquo;June Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>41. The June Affidavit was filed in support of a motion brought by me before Justice Mesbur relating to the sales process. I rely on that affidavit in support of this motion.</P>
<P>42. I submitted an offer to the Receiver to purchase the Waterloo Lands in strict accordance with the sales process order. Way did not submit any offer to the Receiver in accordance with the sales process order.</P>
<P>43. After receipt of my offer to purchase the Waterloo Lands the Receiver obtained a second appraisal which was flawed. Accordingly the Receiver initially did not recommend acceptance of my offer. The Receiver then obtained a third appraisal of the Waterloo Lands because all parties agreed and acknowledged that the second appraisal was flawed.</P>
<P>44. After receiving the third appraisal, the Receiver concluded that my offer to purchase Waterloo was fair since it exceeded the value set by the first and third appraisals. As a result the Receiver recommended sale of the Waterloo lands to me pursuant to the offer that I delivered and accordingly brought a moton seeking court approval for the sale of the Waterloo lands to me. As a result, a 9:30a.m. appointment was made before Mr. Justice Campbell to schedule the Receiver's motion to approve the sale of the Waterloo Lands to me. The Receiver circulated a draft form of order approving the sale and vesting the property in accordance with such a sale.</P>
<P>45. I am advised by James Wortzman that during the Chamber's appointment before Justice Campbell on April 12, 2011, Way advised for the first time of his intention to seek an order removing the Receiver. The stated reason was because the Receiver had decided to accept my offer to purchase the Waterloo Lands and that this was some sort of &ldquo;flip flop&rdquo;.</P>
<P>46. Accordingly, Way attempted to derail the sales process and brought a motion seeking an order removing the Receiver. The motion to remove the Receiver derailed the sales process and the Receiver's motion to approve the sale of the Waterloo Lands to me was adjourned pending the hearing of Way's Removal motion.</P>
<P>47. I believe that Way brought a frivolous motion to remove the Receiver to buy time to submit new offers to purchase all of the Lands and to circumvent the Sales Process.</P>
<P>48. I believe that Way's motion to remove the Receiver was bound to fail. The reasons for that are set out in cost submissions submitted before the Court. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of those costs submissions which set out the history of the matter in an accurate fashion.</P>
<P>49. After Way succeeded in derailing the sales process and having the Receiver's motion to approve the sale of the Waterloo Lands to me adjourned, he submitted an offer to purchase the Waterloo Lands in an amount $500,000.00 greater than my offer and in a form identical to my offer and he also offered to purchase the Oshawa and London lands. None of these offers were made pursuant to the Sales Process order.</P>
<P>50. Way's motion to remove the Receiver was scheduled to be heard May 24, 2011. Way's new offers were submitted outside of the sales process order timelines. Way also made his offer when he was privy to information that he would not have been privy to had he complied with the original sales process order. This is particularized in my June 2011 affidavit.</P>
<P>51. On May 19, 2011, I learned of negotiations between Way and the Receiver which involved Way's offer to abandon his Removal motion in exchange for the Receiver approving Way's new offers to purchase the Lands. As part of this agreement the Receiver would not seek costs of the abandoned Removal motion and agreed to support Way's new proposed sales process.</P>
<P>52. Ultimately the Receiver and Way entered into an agreement in those terms. I was shocked that the Receiver would do this given the terms of the sales process order and the fact that the Receiver had already brought a motion to approve the sale of the Waterloo Lands to me. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of e-mail exchanges between Mr. Wortzman and Mr. Silver (the Receiver's lawyer) sent on May 20, 2011. Those e-mails set out my position regarding what had taken place which is:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;<EM>Very unfair to Gord, who folio-wed the court ordered process, only to have it hijacked by Way who didn't follow the process. Why would you ever recommend a break fee and why is Way the stalking horse, and why is the Receiver acting like a Trustee in bankruptcy rather than an officer of the court following a court ordered process in a dispute between 2 parties? More importantly why would the Receiver ever bargain advice to the court in exchange for the defendant withdrawing a motion to remove? Honestly I cannot believe what you have done. P.S. Sent with prejudice</EM>&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>The withdrawal of the Removal Motion is not independent, but part and parcel of the deal. That is why I explained it was a mistake for you to tie them together</EM>. <BOLD><EM>The Receiver has lost his independence, and was obviously influenced/intimidated by the Removal motion, accordingly we will argue that his advice should not be given any deference by the Court. Doesn't it seem odd that the Receiver was unacceptable to Way until and unless the Receiver did what Way wanted?</EM></BOLD> <EM>Way's tactic worked because the Receiver didn't resist the motion independent of bargaining his advice to the Court. My client cannot understand the position you have taken and I am at a loss to explain it to him. Lastly how is it in the estate's best interest to allow Way to withdraw his tactical and meritless motion without costs? Why should the estate bear 1 penny</EM>? <BOLD><EM>The Receiver was acting in its interests and not the estate's interests because he thinks he will get paid either way, and we will contest that as well as his and your fees</EM>.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>It is too bad it has come to this, because in the face of the Removal motion you ought to have advised the court of Way's last minute, out of time offers (all made when he knew our client had offered on Waterloo and the interest or lack of thereof regarding the other 2 properties), and merely sought directions and let Way argue why the court should indulge him, given the binding and in force order of Mesbur J</EM>. <BOLD><EM>You are recommending Way's offers that he made with knowledge he never would have had if Mesbur's order was followed. It's not just about money, but also process, fairness, and adhering to court orders. The entire process is now contaminated, unworkable and unfair, and you let it happen</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>You seem to forget that the</EM> <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;estate&rdquo; is Gord and Way. Their interests were protected in Mesbur's order, and all you had to do was implement it. Rather you made up rules on the fly because Way finally made an offer after he knew what he ought not to have known and in the face of his abusive motion which achieved its objective of derailing the process</EM></BOLD> <EM>and distracting the Receiver. It is the objective that counts, not the subjective and this is what I unsuccessfully attempted to convey to you. Objectively, the Receiver's conduct is simply wrong and unfair. The whole processes save for our client's initial offer is now tainted and unworkable</EM>.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>53. In accordance with the deal that was made, Way did abandon the motion to remove the Receiver and the Receiver did not seek costs. The Receiver then brought a motion to have an amended sales process approved. That motion was ultimately heard by Justice Mesbur. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Justice Mesbur's order dated June 24, 2011, wherein she approved the new sales process recommended by the Receiver in accordance with the deal the Receiver had made with Way. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Justice Mesbur's reasons for her decision.</P>
<P>54. Justice Mesbur made significant findings of fact regarding Way's conduct in connection with the sales process order. In this regard she made the following findings:
<P1>(a) Because of the falling out between Mr. Schembri and Mr. Way and the likelihood they would fail to cooperate with one another, both agreed that a neutral third party was necessary, but Mr. Way resisted appointing a receiver. Roberts J. found it just and convenient to appoint a receiver in order to &ldquo;<EM>protect the positions of the parties pending the completion of the projects and the final determination of the parties' disputes</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) Way &ldquo;<EM>attacked the Receiver's impartiality and integrity</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>I am troubled by the way the original sales process has got off the rails ... Mr. Schembri complied with the sales order. Mr. Way did not</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(d) &ldquo;<EM>Removing a Receiver is a serious matter. Mr. Way had called the Receiver's integrity into question, and this issue had to be determined. From Mr. Schembri's point of view, the removal motion was tactical, and designed to derail the sales process so that Mr. Way could gain an advantage in it. To some extent, I tend to agree</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(e) &ldquo;W<EM>hen I look at the timing of the removal motion, coupled with Mr. Way's later unsolicited bids for the three properties, I see a tactical move to rest control of the process from the Receiver, and to prevent Mr. Schembri from purchasing Waterloo or to force him to pay significantly more for it than its appraised value</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(f) &ldquo;<EM>What troubles me is that accepting the Receiver's recommendations in large part rewards Mr. Way and condones his behaviour. He had the opportunity to prevent a proper bid as contemplated by the sales order. He chose not to. Instead, he made unsolicited bids while attacking the Receiver's integrity</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(g) &ldquo;<EM>But this is not about Mr. Schembri and Mr. Way</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Their bitterness and ill will towards one another is palpable and will no doubt continue and colour all of their future decisions. It is not the Court's function to facilitate or enable their bitterness and anger</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>Instead, the Court must determine whether the Receiver's proposal is in the overall interest of the Estate and is commercially reasonable</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(h) &ldquo;<EM>As to the fairness or unfairness of the process, both parties have legitimate complaints</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Those complaints, however, have more to do with their own behaviour and wish to crush the other than with the Receiver's exercise of reasonable judgment on the context of the sales process</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(i) &ldquo;<EM>Although this case cries out to be settled, the parties seem to have little appetite for a reasonable settlement</EM>, <BOLD><EM>and would prefer to litigate until all their assets have been spent&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. As a result of Justice Mesbur's decision I sought a motion for stay of her order before the Court of Appeal which was granted by the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal was able to expedite the hearing of the appeal of Justice Mesbur's order and such an appeal was heard on July 11, 2011, only 17 days after Justice Mesbur's decision.</P>
<P>56. The Court of Appeal unanimously set aside and overturned Justice Mesbur's order. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the reasons of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal made the following findings:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;<EM>The conduct of Mr. Way had a negative impact on the integrity of the Court supervised sales process</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>His (Way's) conduct, as it impacted on the integrity of the sales process, should have been given significant weight when deciding whether the Receiver's recommendation to accept Mr. Way's proposal should be approved by the Court</EM>.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>57. Accordingly, as a result of the Court of Appeal's decision, the Commercial Court in Toronto ordered that the sale of the Waterloo Lands to a company controlled by me be approved and that the Receiver be authorized to enter into and execute a sale agreement.</P>
<P>58. Furthermore the Court ordered that a vesting order in the form prescribed by the Land Titles Act and/or the Land Registry Reform Act be registered. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Justice Campbell's order dated August 2, 2011.</P>
<P>59. The sale of the Waterloo Lands was done pursuant to a court ordered process. The issue was ultimately determined by the Court of Appeal. Way never raised the Non-Competition Clause during this entire process. If Way wanted an opportunity to buy the Waterloo Lands then he should have complied with the sales process order. He did not. He tried to circumvent and frustrate the process and his efforts to do so were stopped by the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>60. Pursuant to the vesting order this sale of the Waterloo Lands to my company was approved by the Court.</P>
<P>61. Of interest is paragraph 3 of the Order which states that once the Receiver delivers its certificate then all of the &ldquo;Receivers or 359 King Ontario Inc.'s right, title and interest in and to the property described in the Sale Agreement and listed on Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; hereto (the &ldquo;Purchase Property&rdquo;) hereto shall vest absolutely in the Purchaser, free and clear and from any and all security interest (whether contractual, statutory or otherwise), hypothecs, mortgages, trusts or deemed trusts (whether contractual, statutory or otherwise), liens, executions, levies, charges, or other financial or other monetary claims, whether or not they have attached or been perfected, registered or filed and whether secured, unsecured or otherwise (collectively the &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;).</P>
<P>62. It seems that Way's attempt to assert an interest in the Waterloo Lands seems to be a collateral attack on the order of the Court of Appeal of Ontario and the Order of Justice Campbell wherein the Property was vested in my company.</P>
<P>63. Subsequently Justice Mesbur ordered Way to reimburse the Estate for the Receiver's and its counsel's fees in relation to the abandoned motion to withdraw the Receiver in an amount of $52,545.07 because &ldquo;<EM>it seems to me it is completely unfair for the Plaintiff to bear these costs which were incurred as a result of the Defendant's attack on the Receiver's integrity&mdash;an attack without foundation</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>64. This is not the first time that this matter in this action proceeded to the Court of Appeal. The Plaintiff attempted to seek an amendment to the Statement of Claim and this was partially rejected. Accordingly, an appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>65. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a copy of the reasons of the Court of Appeal dated September 20, 2012, wherein the Court of Appeal found:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;<EM>Based on this undisputed evidence, Roberts J. made a number of significant findings of wrong doing by Mr. Way and the companies he controlled. For instance, she found that Mr. Way had shuffled money around to his corporations, that he had not complied fully with Court order production and he was willing to manipulate figures and to ignore his accountant's advice</EM>.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Present Action</TI>
<P>66. On or around May 25, 2012 the Plaintiffs commenced the within action by way of Statement of Claim. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; and &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the Plaintiffs' Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim and our Amended Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>67. The Plaintiffs allege that Schembri Financial and I have breached the terms of the Agreement by conspiring with the Corporate Defendants to purchase and develop certain properties without first presenting the opportunities to Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial.</P>
<P>68. In respect of these alleged breaches of the Agreement, the Plaintiffs have claimed:
<P1>(a) damages in the amount of $30,500,000 for breach of contract, conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy and punitive damages in connection with certain transactions pertaining to the lands referenced in the Statement of Claim (the &ldquo;Lands&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) declarations that the Defendants hold the Lands by a constructive trust for the Plaintiffs, or any of them;</P1>
<P1>(c) an accounting of all profits and other benefits derived by the Defendants or any of them in connection with the acquisition and development of the Lands (the &ldquo;Accounting&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(d) an order directing the Defendants to pay to the Plaintiffs all amounts found owing to them pursuant to the Accounting; and</P1>
<P1>(e) punitive, aggravated, and exemplary damages in the amount of $500,000.</P1></P>
<P>69. Our position with respect to the applicability of the Non-Competition Clause in relation to 359 King Street is set out above. It is our position that the Plaintiff is estopped from asserting a claim with respect to that property because of the prior proceedings and the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal and the vesting order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Columbia Street Lands</TI>
<P>70. Before my relationship with Way ended, I had 41 Columbia Street under contract. Way attended at that property with me and we walked the property. I told Way that I was intending to construct student housing on that site. Way advised me that he had no interest at all in that property. I told Way that I was intending to develop other student housing on Columbia Street and within the vicinity of the Universities to develop student housing.</P>
<P>71. Way advised me that he had no interest in the acquisition or development of student housing in the Waterloo region.</P>
<P>72. Evidence of this is that Triumph Financial or another Way entity had actually entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with respect to property known municipally as 61 Columbia Street. I asked Way to use the Triumph company to disguise myself from the vendor, because if they knew it was me purchasing the property they would have asked for a higher selling price. Way had no interest in developing that property and accordingly he agreed to assign the agreement of purchase and sale to one of my corporate entities. That corporate entity ended up purchasing 61 Columbia Street and building student housings thereon. This Agreement was entered into well before two years from when this action was commenced. I closed the purchase of the two houses that became 61 Columbia in 2009. Therefore the Plaintiffs were aware of this property well before two years prior to the commencement of this action.</P>
<P>73. To Way's knowledge, I, through my corporate entities have acquired and developed student housing on properties known municipally as 26, 35, 41, 61, 69 and 75 Columbia Street and 347 Spruce, in Waterloo.</P>
<P>74. Way was fully aware of my acquisition of those properties and the development of student housing thereon. Way never indicated to me that he had any interest in those properties or any interest in participating in the development of those properties. To the contrary Way asserted he is NOT a student developer and has no interest in developing student accommodations in Waterloo. Other than 345 King Way still to this day has never developed another Student development in Waterloo.</P>
<P>75. None of 41 Columbia Inc., King and Columbia Inc., 69 Columbia Street Inc. 5 Rittenhouse Inc., The Block Inc., The Block I Inc., or The Block II Inc. have any contractual relationship whatsoever with the Plaintiffs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Non-Competition Clause</TI>
<P>76. It is true that the Non-Competition Clause is in the Shareholder's Agreement.</P>
<P>77. As set out above, I do verily believe that Way has committed serious fundamental breaches of the Shareholder's Agreement and, by so doing, has repudiated same. I accept Way's repudiation of the Shareholder's Agreement and I am seeking damages against him as is evidenced in the Claim asserted in the Main Action. Several Courts have recognized that as a result of Way's dishonourable conduct towards me that it is not possible to work together.</P>
<P>78. The only assets that Triumph Financial has were the shares of the Triumph Subsidiaries. The Triumph Subsidiaries were all placed into receivership. Accordingly, the Shareholder's Agreement has been frustrated. Alternatively the Receiver has control of Triumph since it controls its assets.</P>
<P>79. To the best of my knowledge Triumph Financial has not carried on any business since the Receiver was appointed in September, 2010. It is dormant. There is no Corporate governance, no meetings have been held, no entitled financial statements have been prepared, no minutes have been prepared.</P>
<P>80. If this clause is still in effect it would significantly harm my business and my ability to provide for my family as I would be blocked from ever developing anything in the Waterloo region without Way's involvement. Way would have the ability to stop me from building as I could never work with him again as he surely would continue the misappropriation of funds as the Court has already proven.</P>
<P>81. Given the way Way has treated me there is no possibility that I would ever enter into any development with him or any business venture with him in the future.</P>
<P>82. I believe he feels the same about me. This was made clear during the course of the proceedings. This was recognized by various courts in the findings that they made and which are set out above or in the exhibits to this affidavit. In any event, Way has committed many breaches of the Shareholder's Agreement which are fundamental in nature, including but not limited to:
<P1>(a) There have been no annual general meetings;</P1>
<P1>(b) Triumph Financial has not produced audited statements as is required;</P1>
<P1>(c) Way is not allowed to sign any contracts with respect to matters relating to land acquisition, mortgage financial, construction budgets and project feasibility without my consent. He has done so in direct breach of the agreement;</P1>
<P1>(d) There cannot be a material change in the nature of Triumph Financial's business without my consent. Way refused to provide any financing for the development of the Oshawa Lands thereby creating a change in the nature of Triumph Financial's business. I did not consent. In fact I attempted to obtain a court order forcing Way to provide such financing. I was not successful. The Corporation does not carry on any business.</P1>
<P1>(e) Triumph Financial cannot directly or indirectly make loans or advances to invest in any other corporation or person unless I consent. I have not consented. Way has caused Triumph Financial to make loans or advances or invest in the Triumph Subsidiaries without my consent. He has utilized money from our initial joint venture, transferred it improperly and illegally into other WAY solely owned corporate entities along with Triumph Financial and then into the Triumph Subsidiaries without my consent.</P1>
<P1>(f) Triumph Financial cannot commit to any financing arrangements with third parties without my consent. Way did so with respect to the Triumph Subsidiaries without my consent thereby breaching the agreement.</P1>
<P1>(g) Triumph Financial cannot undertake any projects without project feasibility studies and construction budget approvals without my consent. Notwithstanding this Way proceeded to purport to spend significant monies on the Waterloo Lands, the Oshawa Lands and the London Lands without having construction budget approvals and without project feasibility studies. This was a fundament breach of the agreement by Way.</P1>
<P1>(h) Way improperly attempted to seize my shares in breach of the terms of the Shareholder's Agreement.</P1>
<P1>(i) Way has purported to charge interest on monies he has purported to advance to Triumph Financial contrary to the express provisions of the Shareholder's Agreement and attempted to seize my shares in part based upon interest he alleged was owing, when it was not.</P1>
<P1>(j) I believe there was an implied duty of good faith in Way and I entering into the Shareholder's Agreement. Way has not acted in good faith. There has been a complete breakdown of all trust.</P1>
<P1>(k) Way has committed various frauds against me.</P1>
<P1>(l) Way has caused his companies to send bogus and inflated invoices to Triumph for work that was either not done or never approved by me. He then tried to seize my shares based on these bogus invoices.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Non-Competition Clause is Otherwise Unenforceable</TI>
<P>83. Paragraph 55&ndash;58 of my Statement of Defence set out additional reasons why the Non-Competition Clause is not enforceable. In this regard it is important to note that:
<P1>(a) The clause has no temporal limits and according to Way will bind my children and their children;</P1>
<P1>(b) The clause is not necessary to protect any legitimate commercial interest of Way;</P1>
<P1>(c) The clause is ambiguous and incapable of enforcement;</P1>
<P1>(d) The clause is internally inconsistent and incapable of enforcement;</P1>
<P1>(e) The clause is void for uncertainty;</P1>
<P1>(f) It is impossible to determine when any obligation pursuant to the clause is triggered;</P1>
<P1>(g) The clause is too broad in its scope and purports to bind entities who are not a party to the Shareholder's Agreement;</P1>
<P1>(h) The clause makes no commercial or logical sense;</P1>
<P1>(i) The clause does not distinguish between Triumph and Kingsley;</P1>
<P1>(j) The clause is not necessary to protect Way's business interest. In fact Way has developed real estate in Waterloo region on his own since he signed the Agreement.</P1></P>
<P>84. The Non-Competition Clause is ambiguous with respect to the obligations it purports to impose on Schembri Financial and myself personally. I do not understand how it could be implemented as it is worded. Real Estate development is complex, there are many &ldquo;moving parts&rdquo;, none of the particulars required for a development are set out.</P>
<P>85. For example, I have no knowledge of a &ldquo;typical budget model consistently utilized by [Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial] in such circumstances&rdquo;. No such &ldquo;typical budget model&rdquo; exists.</P>
<P>86. The Non-Competition Clause is too broad, is unreasonable, and is incapable of being understood or enforced.</P>
<P>87. As the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable, there is no basis on which the Plaintiffs can claim that Schembri Financial and I breached our duties under the Agreement by failing to present the Alleged Opportunities to Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial.</P>
<P>88. Way was asked questions about the Non-Competition clause on his discovery and he could not explain how it would operate. If he cannot then it is difficult to imagine how a court could. Way testified that the right is that of Triumph. So, it could never be exercised because I would never agree to it.</P>
<P>89. There is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to the within Statement of Claim as it relates to any alleged breaches of the Agreement.</P>
<P>90. The transcripts of Way's discovery will be filed separately and relied upon by me on this motion.</P>
<P>91. I make this affidavit in support of an order granting summary judgment or in the alternative partial summary judgment and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF ALVEN J. WAY (sworn March 16, 2018)</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, ALVEN J. WAY,</BOLD> businessman, of the City of Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario, make oath and say as follows.</P>
<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> I am a plaintiff, and a director of both of the corporate defendants, in this proceeding (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;)</BOLD>, and a defendant in a related action bearing Court File No. C-42-11 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;)</BOLD>. As such, I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to herein except where knowledge of such facts is stated to be on information and belief and, where so stated, I verily believe those facts to be true.</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> As this affidavit is lengthy, I have included at:
<P1>(a) <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> a table of contents; and</P1>
<P1>(b) <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; a</BOLD> glossary of the defined terms herein (and identifying the page and paragraph where such term is defined).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>3.</BOLD> This affidavit is delivered in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;)</BOLD> and in support of a motion for an order:
<P1>(a) declaring that the defendant, Schembri Financial Limited <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri Financial&rdquo;)</BOLD> is in breach of the Contribution Clause (defined in paragraph 146 below);</P1>
<P1>(b) declaring that Schembri Financial and the defendant, Gordon Schembri <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;)</BOLD> are in breach of the ROFR Clause (defined in paragraph 147 below);</P1>
<P1>(c) declaring that Schembri Financial and Schembri are in breach of the Arbitration Clause (defined in paragraph 148 below);</P1>
<P1>(d) authorizing and directing that the KPMG Portal (defined in paragraph 290 below) be closed immediately;</P1>
<P1>(e) requiring Schembri to serve a further and better affidavit of documents in the Main Action and in ROFR Action;</P1>
<P1>(f) requiring the corporate defendants in the ROFR Action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Corporate Defendants&rdquo;)</BOLD> to serve an affidavit of documents in the ROFR Action;</P1>
<P1>(g) requiring Schembri to deliver answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery in the Main Action conducted on June 28, 29 and 30, and July 27 and 28, 2017; and</P1>
<P1>(h) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis payable forthwith.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>4.</BOLD> The supporting affidavit of Schembri sworn May 17, 2017 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit&rdquo;)</BOLD> refers:
<P1>(a) in paragraph 3 to &ldquo;certain affidavits sworn and filed by&rdquo; Schembri, without identifying such affidavits; and</P1>
<P1>(b) in paragraph 4 to numerous additional materials, including affidavits sworn by Schembri in 2010 and 2011;</P1>
<P1>(collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Additional Schembri ROFR SJ Materials&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>5.</BOLD> By letter dated February 12, 2018, my counsel requested identification of the Additional Schembri ROFR SJ Materials. A copy of this letter is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>6.</BOLD> As at the date of this affidavit, a response to my counsel's letter has not been provided to my knowledge. Accordingly, I believe there are four such affidavits Schembri has apparently filed in support of the ROFR SJ Motion as follows:
<P1>(a) an affidavit sworn April 6, 2010 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri April 2010 Affidavit&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(b) an affidavit sworn May 14, 2010 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri May 2010 Affidavit&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) an affidavit sworn September 5, 2010 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri September 2010 Affidavit&rdquo;);</BOLD> and</P1>
<P1>(d) an affidavit sworn June 7, 2011 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri June 2011 Affidavit&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> I have tried to piece together the facts being alleged by the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit in support of the ROFR SJ Motion, which is exacerbated by:
<P1>(a) the amount of paper contained in the Additional Schembri ROFR SJ Materials; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri (who is a businessman and not a lawyer) appearing to make legal arguments at times.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>1</N><TI>Plaintiffs Oppose the ROFR SJ Motion</TI>
<P><BOLD>8.</BOLD> The plaintiffs oppose the ROFR SJ Motion for the following reasons:
<P1>(a) with respect to the Shareholder Agreement (defined in paragraph 33(b) below):
<P2>(i) I made a deal with Schembri in the presence of our respective lawyers;</P2>
<P2>(ii) the ROFR Clause was a key term of our deal;</P2>
<P2>(iii) both Schembri and I acted in accordance with our deal while Schembri's lawyer drafted the agreement reflecting our deal;</P2>
<P2>(iv) more than two months after we made our deal, Schembri and I executed the Shareholder Agreement (drafted by and negotiated through our respective lawyers) that reflected our deal;</P2>
<P2>(v) thereafter, both Schembri and I continued to act in accordance with our deal until Schembri breached the Shareholder Agreement by failing to comply with:
<P3>(A) the Contribution Clause;</P3>
<P3>(B) the ROFR Clause; and</P3>
<P3>(C) the Arbitration Clause; and</P3></P2>
<P2>(vi) I did not breach the Shareholder Agreement (including as alleged in paragraph 33 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit);</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) with respect to the JV Agreement (defined in paragraph 33(a) below):
<P2>(i) I did not lie to Schembri as alleged in:
<P3>(A) paragraph 14 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit; and</P3>
<P3>(B) paragraph 10 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit;</P3></P2>
<P2>(ii) the profits resulting from the sale of 345 King were never anticipated to be $10,000,000 as alleged in:
<P3>(A) paragraph 43 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit; and</P3>
<P3>(B) paragraph 12 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit;</P3></P2>
<P2>(iii) I did not grossly inflate the amounts of various changes;</P2>
<P2>(iv) the vast majority of the work was not carried out by the Way Group;</P2>
<P2>(v) I did not add to change orders hundreds of hours for labour that were not expended on the JV Project;</P2>
<P2>(vi) there was no improper transfer of $6 million to Premier;</P2>
<P2>(vii) the Other Way Companies (defined in paragraph 20 below) did not receive any improper payments as alleged in paragraphs 61A to 61M of the <UNDER>Amended Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim in the Main Action;</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) with respect to the court proceedings:
<P2>(i) I submitted an en bloc credit offer in good faith; (ii) I did not attempt to derail the sales process;</P2>
<P2>(iii) the motion to substitute the Receiver was well-founded and brought in good faith;</P2></P1>
<P1>(d) Schembri's unexplained inordinate delay that included a delay of three years after repeated representations over several months in 2014, which derailed the efforts of the Way Group (defined in paragraph 21 below) to conduct examinations for discovery in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action (as addressed in below).</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>2</N><TI>The Parties to the Litigation</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Way Group</TI>
<P><BOLD>9.</BOLD> I am sixty years old and have been involved in the development and construction industry for almost 40 years.</P>
<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> I started my own construction company in 1986 that eventually evolved into Jamesway Construction Corporation <BOLD>(&ldquo;Jamesway&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> As an adjunct to the construction services and role of Jamesway, Premier Project Consultants Ltd. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Premier&rdquo;)</BOLD> provides design and project management services. Premier was incorporated on November 13, 2008. However, prior to that, Premier operated for approximately 4 years as a division of Jamesway.</P>
<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> Terra-Tec Excavating <BOLD>(&ldquo;Terra-Tec&rdquo;)</BOLD> is a division of Jamesway and, as the name suggests, is the excavation arm of Jamesway. I caused the business name &ldquo;Terra-Tec Excavating&rdquo; to be registered under the Business Names Act on or about December 12, 2006.</P>
<P><BOLD>13.</BOLD> I caused National Rent-All Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;National&rdquo;)</BOLD> to be incorporated on or about November 19, 1991. National:
<P1>(a) sells construction material, tools and equipment; and</P1>
<P1>(b) supplies construction tools and equipment to contractors, including Jamesway and Terra-Tec, on a rental basis.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>14.</BOLD> Jamesway, Premier and Terra-Tec operated out of premises located at 274 Shirley Drive, Kitchener. Jamesway employed around 100 people during the time of the JV Project (defined in paragraph 33(a) below).</P>
<P><BOLD>15.</BOLD> National operated out of premises in a building next door at 260 Shirley Drive, Kitchener. National employed three people during the time of the JV Project.</P>
<P><BOLD>16.</BOLD> I am the President of Kingsley Financial Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;KFI&rdquo;)</BOLD>. KFI serves a banking function in that it looks after the cash in my various companies.</P>
<P><BOLD>17.</BOLD> I am the President of 1725030 Ontario Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;172&rdquo;)</BOLD>. I caused 172 to be incorporated in connection with the JV Agreement.</P>
<P><BOLD>18.</BOLD> I am the President of Triumph Financial Holdings Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Triumph&rdquo;)</BOLD>. I caused Triumph to be incorporated in connection with the Shareholder Agreement.</P>
<P><BOLD>19.</BOLD> I am the President of each of 359 King Ontario Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;359 King&rdquo;)</BOLD>, Oxford &amp; First St. Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Oxford &amp; First&rdquo;)</BOLD>, and Simcoe &amp; Eastwood Avenue Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Simcoe &amp; Eastwood&rdquo;,</BOLD> and together with 359 King and Simcoe &amp; Eastwood, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Subsidiaries&rdquo;)</BOLD>. I caused the Triumph Subsidiaries to be incorporated in furtherance of the Shareholder Agreement.</P>
<P><BOLD>20.</BOLD> I am the President of each of 1581780 Ontario Ltd. <BOLD>(&ldquo;158&rdquo;)</BOLD>, 1604909 Ontario Inc., The Shores Ltd., Jameshill Developments Limited, The Spruce Street Lofts Inc. and Maple Hill Creeks Apts. Inc. (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Other Way Companies&rdquo;)</BOLD>. The Other Way Companies were added as defendants in the Main Action as granted by the Turnbull Decision (defined in paragraph 310 below).</P>
<P><BOLD>21.</BOLD> Jamesway, Premier, Terra-Tec, National, KFi, 172, Triumph, the Triumph Subsidiaries and the Other Way Companies (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Group&rdquo;)</BOLD> are defendants in the Main Action.</P>
<P><BOLD>22.</BOLD> The accounting department for the Way Group, headed by Greta Crozier <BOLD>(&ldquo;Crozier&rdquo;)</BOLD>, uses Jonas Construction accounting software <BOLD>(&ldquo;Jonas&rdquo;)</BOLD> in the administration of projects, including the JV Project (defined in paragraph 33(a) below). 1 do not have access to Jonas. I do not know how to use Jonas.</P>
<P><BOLD>23.</BOLD> Frank Volpini <BOLD>(&ldquo;Volpini&rdquo;)</BOLD>, of the Waterloo law firm Chris &amp; Volpini, was the lawyer for:
<P1>(a) 172 in connection with the JV Project; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the Triumph Subsidiaries in connection with their incorporation and acquisition of the Triumph Lands (defined in paragraph 33(b) below).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>24.</BOLD> The accountants for the Way Group are Lund &amp; Associates Chartered Accountants <BOLD>(&ldquo;Lund &amp; Associates&rdquo;),</BOLD> who are located in Kitchener. The principal of Lund &amp; Associates is Brad Lund <BOLD>(&ldquo;Lund&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Patterson</TI>
<P><BOLD>25.</BOLD> Faye Patterson <BOLD>(&ldquo;Patterson&rdquo;)</BOLD> has been employed as my executive assistant for about seventeen years. As Schembri knows, I have a personal relationship with Patterson. I believe Schembri sought to add Patterson as a defendant in the Main Action for tactical purposes; namely, to attempt to create upset in our relationship, to cause Patterson emotional distress, and to increase costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Farlow</TI>
<P><BOLD>26.</BOLD> Steve Farlow <BOLD>(&ldquo;Farlow&rdquo;)</BOLD> was the Executive Director of the Schlegel Centre for Entrepreneurship at Wilfred Laurier University, located in Waterloo, Ontario until his retirement in or around 2017. I have known Farlow for many years as a personal friend, and he is one of the trustees of the Way Family Trust I believe Schembri sought to add Farlow as a defendant in the Main Action for tactical purposes.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Schembri Group</TI>
<P><BOLD>27.</BOLD> I met Schembri in late 2006 or early 2007, when I was in my late forties and Schembri was about twenty-seven years old. To my knowledge, Schembri's previous construction and development experience at that time was limited to only a few smaller, less complex, low-rise, wood frame buildings with much lower development and construction costs than those in issue in the Main Action. One of these developments (347 Spruce Street, Waterloo) was across the street from the properties that would later form the JV Lands (defined in paragraph 36 below).</P>
<P><BOLD>28.</BOLD> To my knowledge, Schembri is the controlling mind of Schembri Financial Limited <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri Financial&rdquo;)</BOLD>, Leaf Construction Management Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Leaf&rdquo;)</BOLD> and 1784652 Ontario Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;178&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>29.</BOLD> In the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, Schembri states:
<P1>(a) in paragraph 1 that he is a representative of ROFR Corporate Defendants; and</P1>
<P1>(b) in paragraph 2 that the ROFR Corporate Defendants are controlled by him.</P1></P>
<P>I do not know what Schembri means by the term &ldquo;representative&rdquo;. I note that Schembri swore an affidavit of documents in the ROFR Action on September 30, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri ROFR AoD&rdquo;)</BOLD> on his own behalf only, and makes no reference to the ROFR Corporate Defendants. Accordingly, I am unclear as to what authority, if any, Schembri has to bring the ROFR SJ Motion on behalf of the ROFR Corporate Defendants. A copy of the Schembri ROFR AoD is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>30.</BOLD> To my knowledge, Schembri had only one employee from the time we met until Schembri commenced the Main Action; his name was Tony Varriano.</P>
<P><BOLD>31.</BOLD> Fred Heimbecker <BOLD>(&ldquo;Heimbecker&rdquo;)</BOLD> was the lawyer for Schembri in connection with:
<P1>(a) the assembly of the JV Lands;</P1>
<P1>(b) the negotiation of the JV Agreement; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the negotiation of the Shareholder Agreement.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>32.</BOLD> To my knowledge, Schembri did not have an accountant. However, Schembri did retain KPMG in or around the fall of 2009 in connection with what I refer to as JV Profit Dispute (defined in paragraph 34(a) below).</P>
<P><BOLD>33.</BOLD> Mike Milovick <BOLD>(&ldquo;Milovick&rdquo;)</BOLD> was a real estate agent in Kitchener who introduced Schembri to some of the properties that are the subject matter of the Main Action.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>3</N><TI>The Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>34.</BOLD> Schembri and I are now involved in a document intensive and protracted dispute that essentially revolves around:
<P1>(a) one completed real estate development at 345 King Street, Waterloo, Ontario <BOLD>(&ldquo;345 King&rdquo;)</BOLD> that was carried out as a joint venture (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Project&rdquo;)</BOLD> pursuant to a joint venture agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Agreement&rdquo;)</BOLD> entered into in April, 2007 between 172 and 178; and</P1>
<P1>(b) three interrupted real estate developments&mdash;one each in Waterloo, London and Oshawa, Ontario (individually, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Waterloo Lands,</BOLD> the <BOLD>&ldquo;London Lands&rdquo;</BOLD> and the <BOLD>&ldquo;Oshawa Lands&rdquo;,</BOLD> respectively; and collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Lands&rdquo;)</BOLD>&mdash;that were carried out pursuant to a shareholder agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Shareholder Agreement&rdquo;)</BOLD> entered into in April, 2008 between KFI and Schembri Financial.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>35.</BOLD> Our dispute (while complicated because of the numerous companies involved, the intertwined events and the number of documents), can be summarized as follows:
<P1>(a) Schembri is disputing the costs associated with the JV Project (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Profit Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD>, in part based on a budget that formed part of the JV Agreement and related to a building never approved, financed, constructed, nor sold;</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri is disputing 172's repayment of funds that my companies advanced prior to 172 obtaining construction financing (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Repayment Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) Schembri is alleging that his receipt, directly or indirectly, of $1.4 million in the spring of 2009 was an advance against profits as opposed to a short-term loan (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri Loan Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(d) Schembri is disputing the use of monies from the sale of 345 King to fund the acquisition and commence the development of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rollover Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(e) Schembri is disputing his obligation to contribute his proportionate share of the costs associated with the development of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Contribution Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD> and</P1>
<P1>(f) Schembri is disputing certain of the costs associated with the development of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Costs Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>In short, there are numerous disputes involving millions of dollars; put simply, we are involved in a multi-million dollar lawsuit.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>4</N><TI>The JV Project</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Introduction to Schembri</TI>
<P><BOLD>36.</BOLD> I was informed by one of my site supervisors, Robert Tonin <BOLD>(&ldquo;Tonin&rdquo;)</BOLD>, and believed that Schembri approached him on a project (located at the corner of Erb Street and University Avenue in Waterloo) that Jamesway was constructing at the time. I was further informed by Tonin and believed that Schembri asked Tonin whether Jamesway would be interested in constructing a building on some lands that Schembri was in the process of assembling.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The JV Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>37.</BOLD> I came to learn that Schembri was undertaking a land assembly in Waterloo (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Lands&rdquo;)</BOLD>. Below is a summary of certain of the terms of the five agreements of purchase and sale comprising the JV Lands (individually, an <BOLD>&ldquo;APS&rdquo;;</BOLD> and collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Lands Purchase Agreements&rdquo;):</BOLD>

<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Dealings with Jamesway/Premier Employees</TI>
<P><BOLD>43.</BOLD> After approaching Tonin, Schembri came to have dealings with Paul Vincent <BOLD>(&ldquo;Vincent&rdquo;)</BOLD>, an employee of Jamesway working in the Premier division. Their dealings led to a proposal by Premier dated November 8, 2006 <BOLD>(the &ldquo;Premier Proposal&rdquo;).</BOLD> Schembri did not accept the Premier Proposal. A copy of the Premier Proposal is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>44.</BOLD> Following Vincent's departure from Jamesway in late 2006 to return to Nova Scotia, Schembri then dealt primarily with Dan Bailey <BOLD>(&ldquo;Bailey&rdquo;),</BOLD> another employee of Jamesway working in the Premier division. Copies of various emails between Bailey and Schembri evidencing some of their dealings are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;9&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>45.</BOLD> In addition to dealing with Schembri, Bailey also dealt directly with Schembri's consultants. Copies of various emails between Bailey and:
<P1>(a) Guy Bellehumeur of GB Architect Inc.; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Gunter Nuessler of Progressive Engineering Services Ltd.; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Eric Chung of Chung &amp; Vander Doelen Engineering Ltd.</P1>
evidencing some of Bailey's direct dealings with each of them are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>46.</BOLD> Schembri's dealings with Bailey caused other employees of Jamesway to be involved with Schembri's efforts to redevelop the JV Lands. To the best of my recollection, such other employees of Jamesway included (in alphabetical order) Mike Bogias, Robert Corsi, Deepa Ganeshkumar, Ray Jacobs, Jeff King, Steve Silva, Mark Symons, and Adah Trabulsi. Copies of various handwritten notes of Ray Jacobs evidencing certain of these dealings are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;11&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Financing Efforts</TI>
<P><BOLD>47.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 27 above, I first met Schembri in or about late 2006 or early 2007, when Schembri was about 27 years old.</P>
<P><BOLD>48.</BOLD> From discussions with Schembri, I did not believe that he had the financial resources or the expertise to develop the JV Lands in the manner he was contemplating.</P>
<P><BOLD>49.</BOLD> I contacted John Pehlke <BOLD>(&ldquo;Pehlke&rdquo;),</BOLD> a mortgage broker. I introduced Pehlke to Schembri. I believe Pehlke attempted to source financing for Schembri, but was unsuccessful in doing so. A fax from Pehlke misdated January 31, 2006 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;12&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>50.</BOLD> I attended a meeting with representatives of the Toronto-Dominion Bank <BOLD>(&ldquo;TD&rdquo;)</BOLD> on or about January 30, 2007. A handwritten note of this meeting with TD made by Ray Jacobs, a former employee of Jamesway, is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;13&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>51.</BOLD> I contacted Chris Cardno, who was my banker at CIBC. A copy of an email sent to me by Schembri attaching his net worth statement that I then forwarded to Mr. Cardno is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;14&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>52.</BOLD> I never promised Schembri that I would either:
<P1>(a) secure financing for him; or</P1>
<P1>(b) provide financing to him:</P1>
for the acquisition and development of the JV Lands. Rather, I assisted Schembri as he attempted to secure his own financing.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>5</N><TI>The JV Agreement</TI>
<P><BOLD>53.</BOLD> When it became apparent that Schembri could not obtain financing to complete the purchases of 341 King Street, 349 King Street and 340 Spruce Street, Waterloo, I offered to complete the acquisition of those properties and then develop the JV Lands in the manner contemplated by Schembri.</P>
<P><BOLD>54.</BOLD> I came to believe subsequently that a reason why Schembri may have been unable to obtain financing in his own name to complete any of these purchases was because Schembri had not attended to his personal tax filings and remittances. I learned this in or around the spring of 2009, when Schembri requested to borrow money for around a month to, in part, &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; him until he attended to his tax obligations which would then permit him to arrange mortgage financing on his personal residence that he was in the process of constructing. This borrowing by Schembri relates to the Schembri Loan Dispute (and is addressed below).</P>
<P><BOLD>55.</BOLD> Further to paragraph 53 above, it was my offer to Schembri that led to the suggestion that the development of the JV Lands be carried out by way of a joint venture.</P>
<P><BOLD>56.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 8(b)(i) above, I did not lie to Schembri. Schembri knew that if my companies and I were going to take on the financial risk of the JV Project (then estimated at around $19,000,000) I required that my companies be in control of the development of the JV Lands.</P>
<P><BOLD>57.</BOLD> The negotiation of the JV Agreement occurred over a matter of days; not &ldquo;approximately 2 or 3 weeks&rdquo; as alleged in paragraph 16 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit.</P>
<P><BOLD>58.</BOLD> Patterson did not &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; the JV Agreement as alleged in paragraph 16 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit; rather Patterson typed up certain wording negotiated between Schembri and me, and exchanged drafts by email with Heimbecker. Copies of the emails exchanged by Patterson and Heimbecker in this regard are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;15&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>59.</BOLD> Based on the dates appearing on page two and page three of the JV Pro Forma, I believe Schembri and I executed the JV Agreement no earlier than April 29, 2007 (which was a Sunday according to the calendar). A copy of the JV Agreement is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;16&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>60.</BOLD> The JV Agreement contained provisions for, among other things, the following:
<P1>(a) financing;</P1>
<P1>(b) planning, management and supervision;</P1>
<P1>(c) a pro forma and budget;</P1>
<P1>(d) a &ldquo;5 and 5&rdquo; fee;</P1>
<P1>(e) determination of profit; and</P1>
<P1>(f) distribution of funds;</P1>
which are addressed further below.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Financing of the JV</TI>
<P><BOLD>61.</BOLD> Paragraph 2(7) of the JV Agreement states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>[172] shall be responsible for obtaining financing for the Joint Venture for the Project</EM>,</BOLD> <EM>including interim, bridge and permanent financing</EM>, <BOLD><EM>consistent with the sound business judgment and with loan rate, terms and conditions prevailing</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>62.</BOLD> Paragraph 2(8) of the JV Agreement states, in part:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>[172] shall have the right to encumber the Lands or the Project</EM></BOLD> <EM>without the consent of the other</EM> <BOLD><EM>in amounts sufficient to cover the full contribution of [172]</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Planning, Management and Supervisory Services</TI>
<P><BOLD>63.</BOLD> Paragraph 2(10) of the JV Agreement states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>The Joint Venturers appoint Jamesway Construction (Jamesway) to supervise and manage the construction process</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>Jamesway will complete the construction of the project</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Either Joint Venturer can</EM></BOLD> <EM>participate in the site management meetings during the construction process and</EM> <BOLD><EM>make decisions through the standard construction practice</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Pro Forma and Budget</TI>
<P><BOLD>64.</BOLD> Paragraph 2(9) of the JV Agreement states:
<QUOTE><P><EM>In managing the Joint Venture:</EM></P>
<P>(a) <EM>A Major Decision shall be made by both Joint Venturers. All other decisions shall be made by [172]</EM>.</P>
<P>(b) <BOLD><EM>It is agreed that the attached Project Budget and Performa, referred to as Schedule A, has been reviewed and agreed upon by both Joint Venturers</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>(c) <EM>Construction Contracts shall be agreed and awarded by both Joint Venturers through an open book concept save and except for any work performed by Jamesway. Any increase to Jamesway's contract shall be agreed to by both parties</EM>.</P>
<P>(d) <BOLD><EM>Any increase to the budgetshallbe agreedupon by both Joint Venturers</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>65.</BOLD> The &ldquo;Project Budget and Performa&rdquo; attached as Schedule A to the JV Agreement is three pages (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Pro Forma&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>66.</BOLD> The first page of the JV Pro Forma is a pro forma relating to a building containing a total of 374 bedrooms in 82 units, and having 82 parking spaces. This page was created by Pehlke, and subsequently revised by me in consultation with Schembri.</P>
<P><BOLD>67.</BOLD> The second page of the JV Pro Forma (bearing a date of April 29, 2007) is a budget for the construction costs. Construction costs are also referred to as hard costs. The cost per square foot at the bottom of the second page (namely, $96.07) appears in the line item calculation for &ldquo;Construction&mdash;Building and Site&rdquo; on the first page of the JV Pro Forma. I see that the budget for the construction costs did not include asphalt and masonry; both of which were necessary work.</P>
<P><BOLD>68.</BOLD> The third page of the JV Pro Forma (also bearing a date of April 29, 2007) provides a breakdown of the general conditions, which is a line item in the budget for the construction costs. General conditions relate to items not directly related to the physical construction activities. The winter conditions line item in the general conditions relates to providing heat inside a building for the benefit of all trades as they perform their respective construction activities. This is in contrast to winter construction, which relates to construction activities being performed during the winter by specific trades. Typically, the costs associated with winter construction are borne by those trades performing their work during winter. The JV Pro Forma did not contemplate winter construction for the superstructure and stucco. A copy of an article about winter construction is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;17&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>69.</BOLD> I have reviewed the drawings existing at the time Schembri and I executed the JV Agreement and see that the drawings provide for a building containing a total of 374 bedrooms and 163 bathrooms in 82 units, and having 83 parking spaces (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Pro Forma Building Design&rdquo;)</BOLD>. Copies of the following drawings dated March 29, 2007 are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;18&rdquo;</BOLD>:

<P><BOLD>71.</BOLD> As discussed in below, Schembri participated in and agreed to: (a) changes to the design of the building (including changes required by the City); and (b) the various budgets prepared in connection with the changes to the design of the building.</P></BLOCK2>

<P><BOLD>75.</BOLD> In furtherance of the JV Agreement, arrangements were made to extend the closing date for each of the three properties that Schembri did not have the financing to close (namely, 341 King Street, 349 King Street and 340 Spruce Street, Waterloo). Such arrangements included payment of a further deposit in the amount of:
<P1>(a) $20,000 in connection with 340 Spruce Street, Waterloo; and</P1>
<P1>(b) $5,000 in connection with 349 King Street, Waterloo.</P1></P>

<P><BOLD>81.</BOLD> I do not know the amounts Schembri paid in connection with carrying 345 King and 344 Spruce (eg. mortgage payments to TD and RBC, and property insurance). However, I do know that such payments did not include property taxes as 172 paid the outstanding property taxes on 345 King and 344 Spruce when it acquired these properties from Schembri's father (as appears in the trust ledger statements forming part of Exhibit &ldquo;21&rdquo;).</P>
<P><BOLD>82.</BOLD> I do not know the amounts Schembri paid in connection with developing the JV Lands (eg. Phase One assessments for 345 King and 344 Spruce, and site plan fee(s) paid to the City). However, I do know that such payments did not include the services rendered by Schembri's consultants; namely:
<P1>(a) GB Architect inc.;</P1>
<P1>(b) ACI Survey Consultants Inc.;</P1>
<P1>(c) Progressive Engineering Services Ltd.; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Chung Vander Doelen Engineering Ltd.;</P1>
as the work Schembri contracted them to perform was paid by my companies (after reissuance of invoices in some instances). Copies of the invoices rendered by Schembri's consultants and the cheques evidencing payment thereof are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;23&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>83.</BOLD> To my knowledge, the only document Schembri provided relating to payments he made in connection with the acquisition, carrying and development of the JV Lands is a letter dated May 31, 2008 stating that Schembri &ldquo;advanced $47,500&rdquo; to KFI. This letter is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;24&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>7</N><TI>Maestro</TI>
<P><BOLD>84.</BOLD> Around the time that 172 acquired the JV Lands, I learned that an owner of student residences called Maestro (that was based in Quebec) was interested in the JV Project. A copy of an email sent to me on May 14, 2007 by Pierre Pelletier of Maestro is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;25&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>85.</BOLD> Maestro subsequently offered to pay $24,300,000 for the construction of a building: (a) containing a total of 360 bedrooms and 360 bathrooms in 94 units; and; (b) having 95 parking spaces (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Maestro Offer&rdquo;)</BOLD>. A copy of the Maestro Offer is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>86.</BOLD> Consequently, Premier redesigned the building to meet the requirements of Maestro, and prepared a pro forma and budget in connection therewith. Schembri agreed with doing so; and Schembri agreed with the pro forma and budget. A copy of this pro forma and budget is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;27&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>87.</BOLD> Schembri and I agreed to negotiate the Maestro Offer. In furtherance of our agreement, 172 retained Ian Wismer at Miller Thomson in Waterloo, and prepared a memorandum setting out the main business terms of a counteroffer. This memorandum was the subject of further negotiation between Maestro and 172. Copies of the memorandum dated July 9, 2007 and the subsequent revisions are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>88.</BOLD> Maestro withdrew from further negotiations following receipt of a market study dated September 11, 2007. A copy of this market study is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;29&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>

<P><BOLD>90.</BOLD> The JV Project was considered by the City's Site Plan Review Committee on July 23, 2007. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;31&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of:

<P><BOLD>94.</BOLD> The City subsequently issued five demolition permits dated November 29, 2007 for the houses on the JV Lands (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Demolition Permits&rdquo;)</BOLD> following receipt of payment in the amount of $4,750 from 158 on behalf of 172 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Demolition Permits Payment&rdquo;)</BOLD>.

<P><BOLD>95.</BOLD> I believe Schembri arranged for Sittler Environmental to demolish the houses on the JV Lands.

<BLOCK1><N>10</N><TI>JV Construction Financing</TI>
<P><BOLD>96.</BOLD> Throughout the fall of 2007, I attempted to obtain construction financing for the JV Project. In furtherance of my efforts, I caused 172 to engage Murray &amp; Company to locate mezzanine financing in the approximate amount of $5 million.</P>
<P><BOLD>97.</BOLD> Murray &amp; Company sourced Trez as a potential lender of mezzanine financing.</P>
<P><BOLD>98.</BOLD> Murray &amp; Company then sourced Kingsett Capital as a potential lender of mezzanine financing. Following negotiations, 172 entered into a financing commitment from Kingsett Capital in the amount of $4,950,000 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Kingsett Commitment&rdquo;)</BOLD>. Copies of the Kingsett Commitment and the prior proposals are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;36&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>99.</BOLD> One issue in the prior proposals of Kingsett related to their requirement that certain of the work to be performed requiring the contractors to be bonded, which would mean additional cost to 172 in carrying out the JV Project. 172 negotiated that term, and avoided that additional cost.</P>
<P><BOLD>100.</BOLD> As a consequence of the Kingsett Commitment, 172 finalized a construction financing commitment from CIBC in the amount of $14,600,000 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;CIBC Construction Commitment&rdquo;)</BOLD>. A copy of the CIBC Construction Commitment is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;37&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>101.</BOLD> In connection with the Kingsett Commitment and the CIBC Construction Commitment, a budget for the building to be constructed was prepared and provided.</P>
<P><BOLD>102.</BOLD> As required by the Kingsett Commitment and the CIBC Construction Commitment, 172 incurred and paid the following fees:

<P>The London Lands Purchase Agreement is attached and marked hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;40&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>12</N><TI>The Triumph Deal</TI>
<P><BOLD>109.</BOLD> On January 29, 2008, Schembri, Schembri's father, Heimbecker, Patterson, Volpini and I met in the boardroom at Jamesway's offices to discuss a deal between Schembri and me for the development of the Waterloo Lands and the London Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;January 2008 Meeting&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>110.</BOLD> At the January 2008 Meeting, Schembri and I agreed to a deal (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Deal&rdquo;)</BOLD> whereby:
<P1>(a) we would incorporate Triumph as a holding company, in which I would have a fifty-five percent (55%) interest and Schembri would have a forty-five percent (45%) interest;</P1>
<P1>(b) we would incorporate subsidiaries of Triumph to acquire and develop the Waterloo Lands and the London Lands in the manner that we were developing the JV Lands (namely, Premier doing the design work in conjunction with various consultants, and Jamesway doing the project management, including the general conditions); and</P1>
<P1>(c) Schembri would look for other lands in Kitchener and Waterloo for us to acquire and develop.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>111.</BOLD> To be clear, at the January 2008 Meeting I did not agree to either:
<P1>(a) fund the development of the properties to be acquired through subsidiaries of Triumph; or</P1>
<P1>(b) guarantee third party financing for the development of such properties.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>13</N><TI>Actions Taken in Accordance with the Triumph Deal</TI>
<P><BOLD>112</BOLD>. Following the January 2008 Meeting and prior to the execution of the Shareholder Agreement Schembri and I acted in accordance with Triumph Deal.</P>
<P><BOLD>113.</BOLD> Certain of the actions taken by us included the following:
<P1>(a) Schembri provided an analysis for the renovation of an apartment building located at 137 University Avenue West, Waterloo, which I incorporated into my pro forma template that we subsequently went back and forth on;</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri received a financing proposal for the Waterloo Lands;</P1>
<P1>(c) Schembri executed an amendment to the London Lands Purchase Agreement dated February 6, 2008;</P1>
<P1>(d) Schembri extended closing dates for the Waterloo Lands;</P1>
<P1>(e) Schembri and I considered an opportunity for a property locatedat Bricker and Ezra in Waterloo;</P1>
<P1>(f) Schembri prepared pro formas in the format of my template for:
<P2>(i) each of the Triumph Lands;</P2>
<P2>(ii) 137 University Avenue West, Waterloo; and</P2>
<P2>(iii) 534 Mariner Road, Kitchener; and</P2></P1>
<P1>(g) Schembri entered into agreements of purchase and sale for:
<P2>(i) 137 University Avenue West, Waterloo; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) 534 Mariner Road, Kitchener;</P2></P1></P>
<P>Copies of the documents evidencing the foregoing actions are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;41&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>114.</BOLD> Ultimately, Schembri and I did not pursue these development opportunities.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>14</N><TI>Incorporation of Triumph and 359 King</TI>
<P><BOLD>115.</BOLD> Schembri and I incorporated Triumph and 359 King on or about February 28, 2008. Both myself and Schembri are directors and officers of Triumph and 359 King; I am the President and Schembri is the Secretary-Treasurer. Triumph is the sole shareholder of 359 King. Copies of the documents relating to the incorporation of Triumph are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;42&rdquo;.</BOLD> Copies of the documents relating to the incorporation of 359 King are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;43&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>116.</BOLD> In connection with the incorporations of Triumph and 359 King, Schembri and I executed banking documents with CIBC. Copies of these banking documents are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;44&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>117.</BOLD> The sole business and purpose of 359 King was to design, construct and sell a condominium development on the Waterloo Lands. The preliminary budget to develop the Waterloo Lands was $28,000,000.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>15</N><TI>JV Tendering and Awarding of Contracts</TI>
<P><BOLD>118.</BOLD> Around the time that 172 secured construction financing for the JV Project, Jamesway began the process of: (a) tendering; (b) evaluating bids submitted; and (c) awarding contracts.</P>
<P><BOLD>119.</BOLD> The tendering process involved creating an &ldquo;FTP&rdquo; site and contacting various trades inviting them to tender. Based on the documents listed in the Way Main Action AoD (defined in paragraph 293), Allison Craine, a project co-ordinator for Jamesway, appears to have been the primary point person in contacting various trades during the tendering process.</P>
<P><BOLD>120.</BOLD> Following the tendering process, Jamesway evaluated the bids submitted by various trades in respect of specific activities relating to the construction of the JV Approved Building Design. Based on the documents listed in the Way Main Action AoD and to the best of my recollection, the then Jamesway employees involved in the process of tendering, evaluating bids and awarding contracts included (in alphabetical order) Rob Corsi, Allison Craine, Jeff King, Ryan Morrison and Steve Silva.</P>
<P><BOLD>121.</BOLD> Schembri was actively involved in the process of tendering, evaluating bids and awarding contracts.</P>
<P><BOLD>122.</BOLD> Evidence of certain of Schembri's involvement in this process appears in the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit at paragraphs 62 to 66, wherein Schembri states:
<P1>(a) he was &ldquo;responsible for retaining trades to perform the flooring, drywalling, masonry and millwork&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) he &ldquo;retained Olympia Tile to supply the tile and The Source to supply the laminate&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) he &ldquo;retained Balkan Factory and Mike's Hardwood Flooring to install the tile and the laminate&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(d) the expense in connection with (b) and (c) above, &ldquo;was approximately $240,000 less than had been budgeted&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(e) he &ldquo;retained Alcove Drywall Systems to supply and install drywall&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(f) he &ldquo;retained Mora Masonry to perform the masonry work&rdquo;, who did so &ldquo;for approximately $60,000 less than the next lowest bid; and</P1>
<P1>(g) he &ldquo;retained Schembri Custom Kitchens to supply the materials for the kitchens, and to install the kitchens', which it 'did so for approximately $80,000 less than the next lowest bid&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>123.</BOLD> There are several errors and omissions in Schembri's evidence in paragraphs 62 to 66 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit; certain of which are as follows:
<P1>(a) Mapleton Flooring supplied the laminate, not The Source;</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri's purported retention of Mike's Hardwood Flooring fails to mention that the purchase order provided that Mike's would only transfer the laminate material to the units after the laminate material had been carried and placed on each floor of the 14-story building; leaving it to James way to do so;</P1>
<P1>(c) Schembri omits the fact that there were other flooring materials supplied and installed; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Schembri omits the fact that Schembri Custom Kitchens failed to carry the kitchen cabinets from outside the building (where they were delivered) to each and every one of the units in the 14-story building (where they were to be installed); leaving it to Jamesway to do so.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>124.</BOLD> Regarding paragraph 123(c) above, the table below summarizes the work performed in connection with flooring:

<P><BOLD>129.</BOLD> In addition to the differences shown in the table above, the City required through the site plan approval process, among other things:
<P1>(a) more landscaping features;</P1>
<P1>(b) increasing the height of the exterior of the building that was to be cladded with masonry stone (as opposed to stucco), as well as incorporating masonry stone into the parking garage;</P1>
<P1>(c) more pronounced massing articulation on all elevations by, among other things, recessing, &ldquo;step backs&rdquo; and terracing; and</P1>
<P1>(d) enhanced stucco detailing;</P1>
as evidenced by Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33 (as marked in paragraphs 90 and 91).</P>
<P><BOLD>130.</BOLD> In short, the JV Approved Building Design is materially different from the JV Pro Forma Building Design; and those differences impacted the budget materially.</P>
<P><BOLD>131.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 101 above, Jamesway prepared a construction budget for what became the JV Approved Building Design. Subsequently, Jamesway updated the construction budget from time to time. To the best of my recollection Jeff King and Steve Silva were involved in doing so. Schembri participated in preparing these budgets. Copies of the various construction budgets for the JV Approved Building Design are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;48&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>132.</BOLD> Schembri admits receiving the construction budgets dated January 21 and February 26, 2009. However, Schembri alleges that he did not approve these budgets at the time that they were presented to him. Not only did Schembri approve the budgets relating to the JV Approved Building, he was involved in their preparation. Moreover, Schembri never told me at any time that he disapproved of any of the budgets for the JV Approved Building Design.</P>
<P><BOLD>133.</BOLD> I relied on Schembri's direct involvement in the JV Project (including the approval of the budgets relating to the JV Approved Building Design), when: (a) entering into the Kingsett Commitment and the CIBC Commitment totaling nearly $20,000,000 (that I personally guaranteed along with several of my companies); and (b) obtaining the JV Building Permit (defined in paragraph 134 below).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>17</N><TI>JV Building Permit</TI>
<P><BOLD>134.</BOLD> I am informed by Patterson and believe that on March 18, 2008 she attended to 172's payment of the fees required for the issuance of a building, permit in connection with the JV Approved Building Design (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Building Permit&rdquo;),</BOLD> broken down as follows:

<BLOCK1><N>18</N><TI>Construction of JV Approved Building Design Commences</TI>
<P><BOLD>136.</BOLD> Following issuance of the JV Building Permit, Terra-Tec commenced performance of site servicing and earthworks.</P>
<P><BOLD>137.</BOLD> Around the time that construction of the JV Approved Building Design commenced, Schembri and I agreed that he would act as &ldquo;owner's rep&rdquo;, and that 172 would pay him $500 per week for doing so (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Owner's Rep Agreement&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>138.</BOLD> Contrary to Schembri's allegation, the Owner's Rep Agreement was not incorporated as a line item in the breakdown of the general conditions (at the third page of the JV Pro Forma bearing a date of April 29, 2007, nearly one year prior to the Owner's Rep Agreement).</P>
<P><BOLD>139.</BOLD> Tonin was site superintendent, and as such was on site almost every day construction took place. John MacDonald was project manager, and worked primarily from Jamesway's offices.</P>
<P><BOLD>140.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 57 and 59 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit, Schembri was: (a) onsite at 345 King; and (b) in contact with me; almost every day construction took place. In addition, Schembri attended at Jamesway's premises almost daily, and joked that he ought to have a desk beside Patterson.</P>
<P><BOLD>141.</BOLD> At some point during the early stages of construction, two things occurred. First, Schembri and I agreed to install security cameras in and on the building. This involved repurposing the security cameras previously purchased and installed on the site trailers, and purchasing additional security cameras. 172 entered into a purchase order with Leaf for this work. Copies of the documents relating to the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;50&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>142.</BOLD> Secondly, Schembri decided that he wanted to reconfigure the ground floor and the basement of the JV Approved Building Design as he believed doing so would increase the value of 345 King. Subsequently, drawings were prepared providing for this reconfiguration.</P>
<P><BOLD>143.</BOLD> As a consequence of this reconfiguration, 172 had to submit revised drawings to the City for approval and pay a fee in the amount of $1,363.20 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Reconfiguration Fee&rdquo;)</BOLD>. Copies of certain documents relating to the Reconfiguration Fee are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;51&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>144.</BOLD> Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;52&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the following drawings submitted to the City that resulted in the Reconfiguration Fee:

<BLOCK1><N>19</N><TI>The Shareholder Agreement</TI>
<P><BOLD>145.</BOLD> At some point before April 9, 2008, Schembri and I executed the Shareholder Agreement. A copy of an email sent April 9, 2008 forming the basis of my belief as to the timing of execution is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;53&rdquo;.</BOLD> A copy of the Shareholder Agreement is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;54&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>146.</BOLD> The Shareholder Agreement provided for, among other things, the following:
<P1>(a) financing;</P1>
<P1>(b) non-competition (aka the ROFR Clause); and</P1>
<P1>(c) arbitration; and</P1>
<P1>(d) final agreement;</P1>
which are discussed further below.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Financing</TI>
<P><BOLD>147.</BOLD> Article 12 of the Shareholder Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Contribution Provision&rdquo;)</BOLD> states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>All liabilities incurred by, arising from or in connection with [Triumph]</EM>,</BOLD> <EM>including any loans or overdrafts with any banks or lending institutions, which have been personally guaranteed by any of the parties hereto</EM>, <BOLD><EM>shall be shared on a pro rata basis by the parties hereto</EM></BOLD> <EM>based on a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares held by each Shareholder and the denominator of which shall be the total issued and outstanding shares in the capital stock of [Triumph]</EM> <BOLD><EM>and if any of the parties hereto discharges any liabilities of [Triumph]</EM></BOLD> <EM>either</EM> <BOLD><EM>directly</EM></BOLD> <EM>or pursuant to a guarantee given by any of the parties hereto</EM>, <BOLD><EM>then the party discharging the liabilities shall have the right to be reimbursed</EM></BOLD> <EM>by the parties not so contributing</EM> <BOLD><EM>so that the in the end result, each of the parties hereto shall have contributed equally to all liabilities incurred</EM></BOLD> <EM>and/or guarantees given. Until such time that the parties not so contributing have reimbursed the party discharging the liability, the shares of the parties not so contributing shall be held by the accountants of [Triumph] acting as escrow agent and at the option of the party discharging the liability, said shares may be sold if the parties not so contributing have not reimbursed the party discharging the liabilities within THIRTY (30) days after the party discharging the liabilities has demanded reimbursement thereof and the proceeds from the sale of such shares after deduction of any expenses incurred in the sale, shall be applied on account of the debt owing from the parties not so contributing to the party discharging the liabilities, but any surplus of proceeds over and above the debt owing shall be distributed to the parties not so contributing</EM>. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Non-Competition (aka the ROFR Clause)</TI>
<P><BOLD>148.</BOLD> Article 13 of the Shareholder Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Clause&rdquo;)</BOLD> states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>During the period which [Schembri Financial] is a shareholder of the Corporation, it shall have the ongoing obligation to present to [KFI] and [Triumph] all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>This obligation to [KFI] and [Triumph] shall also extend to [Schembri] personally, and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise. [KFI] and [Triumph] shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances and, if at the expiry of the FIFTEEN (15) day period neither of them have indicated to [Schembri Financial] in writing that it is taking on the Project, then [Schembri Financial] (or its designate) shall be free to pursue the Project without the involvement of [KFI] or [Triumph]</EM>. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Arbitration</TI>
<P><BOLD>149.</BOLD> Article 15 of the Shareholder Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Arbitration Provision&rdquo;)</BOLD> states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>Any dispute</EM></BOLD> <EM>between the parties hereto, whether arising during the period of this Agreement or at any time thereafter</EM> <BOLD><EM>which touches upon the validity, construction, meaning, performance or effect of this Agreement or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto</EM></BOLD> <EM>or any matter arising out of or connected with this Agreement</EM> <BOLD><EM>shall be subject to arbitration pursuant to the Arbitrations Act, 1991</EM>,</BOLD> <EM>as amended from time to time, and as provided for in this Article and the decision shall be final and binding between the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal</EM>. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Final Agreement</TI>
<P><BOLD>150.</BOLD> Article 23 of the Shareholder Agreement states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>This Agreement expresses the final agreement between the parties hereto with respect to all matters herein</EM></BOLD> <EM>and its execution has not been induced by, nor do any of the parties hereto rely upon or regard as material, any representation or premises [sic] whatsoever not incorporated herein or made a part hereof, and any alteration, amendment or qualification thereof shall be null and void and shall not be binding upon any such party unless made and recorded as aforesaid</EM>. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>151.</BOLD> Finally I note that the Shareholder Agreement does not require KFI (or me personally) to either:
<P1>(a) fund the development of the properties to be acquired through subsidiaries of Triumph; or</P1>
<P1>(b) guarantee third party financing for the development of such properties.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>152.</BOLD> It is preposterous for Schembri to allege after the fact that I agreed to (a) above. Schembri is talking about tens of millions of dollars in funding that would cost millions of dollars in fees and interest if such funding was provided by third parties. Then there is the risk; I would have all the risk and Schembri would have none. I note that Schembri did not make this allegation until he sought to amend his statement of claim in the Main Action. Finally, to my knowledge Schembri has not sued Heimbecker for his failure to include such a significant term in the Shareholder Agreement.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>20</N><TI>Oshawa Lands Tied Up</TI>
<P><BOLD>153.</BOLD> Prior to execution of the Shareholder Agreement, Schembri and I came to be introduced the Oshawa Lands by a real estate agent To the best of my recollection some ten years later, that real estate agent was Milovick.</P>
<P><BOLD>154.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 113 above, Schembri prepared a pro forma for the Oshawa Lands in the model I use to determine whether a particular development project is economically feasible.</P>
<P><BOLD>155.</BOLD> Contrary to paragraph 16 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, Schembri entered into agreements of purchase and sale for the Oshawa Lands on behalf of Triumph following execution of the Shareholder Agreement.</P>

<P><BOLD>157.</BOLD> Following execution by Schembri of various waivers, amendments, extensions and assignments, 359 King completed the acquisition of the Waterloo Lands on or about April 25, 2008. Copies of those documents along with the reporting letters of Volpini are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;56&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>158.</BOLD> The acquisition of the Waterloo Lands was funded as follows:
<P1>(a) $1,950,000 from Cameron Stephens Financial Corporation <BOLD>(&ldquo;CSFC&rdquo;);</BOLD> and</P1>
<P1>(b) the balance of $426,602.44 from KFI.</P1></P>
<P>In connection with (a) above, 359 King granted CSFC a mortgage over the Waterloo Lands in the amount of $2,000,000<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CSFC held back $50,000 of the mortgage amount.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the <BOLD>&ldquo;CSFC Mortgage&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the CSFC Mortgage is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;57&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>159.</BOLD> In connection with the acquisition of the Waterloo Lands, Schembri executed:
<P1>(a) a resolution dated April 24, 2008 authorizing the acquisition of the Waterloo Lands; and</P1>
<P1>(b) a resolution dated April 23, 2008 authorizing the CSFC Mortgage.</P1></P>
<P>Copies of these resolutions are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;58&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>160.</BOLD> At the time that 359 King acquired the Waterloo Lands, the houses thereon were rented to tenants. Another one of my companies (namely, Kinsgley Management Inc.) administered to these tenancies going forward.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>22</N><TI>Maas APS</TI>
<P><BOLD>161.</BOLD> On or around June 18, 2008,172 entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Maas APS&rdquo;)</BOLD> with Sean Maas <BOLD>(&ldquo;Maas&rdquo;)</BOLD> providing for the completion of a sale of the JV Lands (now consolidated and known municipally as 345 King Street North, Waterloo) &ldquo;14 days following the date that occupancy approval is granted by the [City] for the intended project herein&rdquo;. A copy of the Maas APS is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;59&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>162.</BOLD> Over the next month or so, 172 and Maas executed two amendments and a notice of fulfillment of condition resulting in the Maas APS becoming firm and binding. Copies of these documents are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;60&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>163.</BOLD> Around the time that the Maas APS became firm and binding, Schembri and I agreed to roll the profits of the JV Project into Triumph and then to the Triumph Subsidiaries (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rollover Agreement&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>164.</BOLD> Schembri attempts to take credit for the Maas APS, and alleges it was a much better deal than that contemplated by the Maestro counter-offer (addressed in paragraph 87 above). Schembri is wrong on both accounts.</P>

<BLOCK1><N>23</N><TI>Construction of JV Approved Building Continues</TI>
<P><BOLD>166.</BOLD> In or around August, 2008, Rejean Dupuis <BOLD>(&ldquo;Dupuis&rdquo;)</BOLD> took over from John MacDonald as project manager for the JV Project.</P>
<P><BOLD>167.</BOLD> Over the summer and into the fall, a number of events occurred giving rise to agreements between Schembri and me, some of which resulted in additional costs to the JV Project.</P>
<P><BOLD>168.</BOLD> One such event related to people entering the building during the night and jumping out of the building and into the safety netting below (that had been erected over the area being worked on by the masons to protect them from anything that may fall while the stucco trades worked above them). As a consequence, Schembri and I agreed to hire security guards to attend onsite overnight. Copies of the invoices relating to the provision of security guards are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;61&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>169.</BOLD> Schembri and I agreed to provide and operate a man lift to assist trades working inside the building. A copy of the change order in this regard is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;62&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>170.</BOLD> Another event related to the identification of a grading issue that resulted in Patterson organizing an onsite meeting among the landscape designer (Guenter Nuessler), Tonin and MacDonald. A copy of the notes of this meeting is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;63&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Stucco Delay and The Fall</TI>
<P><BOLD>171.</BOLD> The most significant, and serious, event occurred when an employee of a stucco subcontractor fell off a scaffold in November, 2008 and suffered serious injuries (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Fall&rdquo;).</BOLD> As a consequence of the Fall, the Ministry of Labour issued a Stop Work Order (the <BOLD>&ldquo;MoL Stop Work Order&rdquo;)</BOLD>. The Ministry of Labour subsequently lifted the MoL Stop Work Order after imposing various safety measures. Copies of the documents relating to the Fall and the MoL Stop Work Order are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;64&rdquo;.</BOLD> Pictures of the scaffolds are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;65&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>172.</BOLD> The stucco work had already been delayed as a result of the contractor, MIK Wall Systems Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;MIK&rdquo;)</BOLD> having insufficient labour onsite. The Fall further delayed the stucco work, and pushed it into wintertime. As a consequence of the delay in completing the stucco work, completion of the parkade was interrupted to accommodate the scaffold/lifts needed for the performance of the stucco work. This in turn required Jamesway employees to use hand tools to keep the exposed rebar in the parkade free of snow and ice. A picture of the exposed rebar in the parkade is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;66&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Minutes of Construction Meetings</TI>
<P><BOLD>173.</BOLD> In connection with the construction of the JV Approved Building Design as reconfigured, Jamesway held thirty-seven (37) meetings with contractors between April 7, 2008 and January 26, 2009 (for the most part on a weekly basis). Minutes of these meetings would be prepared by an employee of Jamesway and distributed by facsimile transmission to the various trades. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;67&rdquo;</BOLD> is a table showing:
<P1>(a) the dates of these meetings; and</P1>
<P1>(b) whether Schembri, his father (Mario) and/or his employee (Tony Varriano) attended a particular meeting, and/or received a copy of the meeting minutes by facsimile transmission.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>174.</BOLD> I addressed above certain of Schembri's direct involvement in the construction process. I now wish to address the direct involvement of Schembri's employee, Tony Varriano. As shown in Exhibit &ldquo;67&rdquo;, Tony Varriano attended site meetings. Tony Varriano also communicated with Dupuis and other Jamesway employees in connection with various construction activities. Copies of emails evidencing the direct involvement of Tony Varriano in the construction process are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;68&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>175.</BOLD> In connection with the financing requirements, 172 provided financial information to cm2r. I believe cm2r reviewed this information, verified that information (by among other things, attending at the building), and once satisfied incorporated that information into their reports to CIBC and Kingsett. cm2r prepared eleven such reports commencing January 31, 2008 and ending December 31, 2008 (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;cm2r Reports&rdquo;)</BOLD> on a monthly basis, save and except for the month of February.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>24</N><TI>Incorporation of Oxford &amp; First and Simcoe &amp; Eastwood</TI>
<P><BOLD>176.</BOLD> Schembri and I incorporated Oxford &amp; First on or about November 13, 2008. Both myself and Schembri are directors and officers of Oxford &amp; First; I am the President and Schembri is the Secretary-Treasurer. Triumph is the sole shareholder of Oxford &amp; First. A copy of the documents relating to the incorporation of Oxford &amp; First are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;69&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>177.</BOLD> In connection with the incorporation of Oxford &amp; First, Schembri and I executed banking documents with CIBC. Copies of these banking documents are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;70&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>178.</BOLD> The sole business and purpose of Oxford &amp; First was to design, construct and sell a student housing development on the London Lands. The preliminary budget to develop the London Lands was $34,250,000.</P>
<P><BOLD>179.</BOLD> Schembri and I incorporated Simcoe &amp; Eastwood on or about November 17, 2008. Both myself and Schembri are directors and officers of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood; I am the President and Schembri is the Secretary-Treasurer. Triumph is the sole shareholder of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood. A copy of the documents relating to the incorporation of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;71&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>180.</BOLD> In connection with the incorporation of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood, Schembri and I executed banking documents with CIBC. Copies of these banking documents are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;72&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>181.</BOLD> The sole business and purpose of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood was to design, construct and sell a student housing development on the Oshawa Lands. The preliminary budget to develop the Oshawa Lands was $12,000,000.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>25</N><TI>Development of the Waterloo Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>182.</BOLD> Schembri knew about and participated in our decision to develop the Waterloo Lands into a 17-storey, 93 unit condominium residence. Copies of certain of the documents evidencing Schembri's knowledge and participation are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;73&rdquo;.</BOLD> A copy of the proof of claim in the amount of $25,000 (purportedly for monies owing for design services) filed by Schembri in the Receivership Proceedings (defined in paragraph 256 below) is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;74&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>26</N><TI>Efforts to Close Maas APS</TI>
<P><BOLD>183.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 161 above, closing of the Maas APS was to occur &ldquo;14 days following the date that occupancy approval is granted by the [City] for the intended project herein&rdquo;. In furtherance thereof, Jamesway worked hard to obtain occupancy approval as quickly as possible, and succeeded in doing so on or about February 6, 2009 and a closing date of February 20, 2009 was set. Copies of certain of the documents evidencing the foregoing efforts to close to set the closing date for February 20, 2009 are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;75&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>184.</BOLD> Another term of the Maas APS required 172 to use best efforts to rent out units, and that Maas would be entitled to hold back up to $400,000 pending renting up to 90% of the building by no later than October 31, 2009. In paragraph 38 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit, Schembri alleges that he located Wilfrid Laurier University as a tenant and negotiated a long-term for the entire building. This is not true. Others were involved in the effort to fulfill this term, and avoid any hold back; Schembri did not locate Wilfrid Laurier University, nor negotiate the lease. Copies of the documents relating to the lease with Wilfrid Laurier University are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;76&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>185.</BOLD> Around this time, Schembri and I learned that 172 may not be entitled to claim the new residential rental property rebate because we would be selling 345 King. Copies of emails evidencing the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;77&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>27</N><TI>Maas $6m Non-Refundable Deposit</TI>
<P><BOLD>186.</BOLD> Between the date of the Maas APS and the approaching closing date of February 20, 2009, the U.S. economy had weakened and there appeared to me, upon reflection, dissension in the Maas family.</P>
<P><BOLD>187.</BOLD> I came to be contacted by Terry Maas, the older half-brother of Sean Maas, and negotiated with him an extension of the Maas APS. Our negotiation began with a telephone discussion a few days before the approaching closing date. Schembri was in my office as I spoke with Terry Maas on speaker phone about the approaching closing date. Terry Maas wanted an extension. I told him that I had other deals that were set to close, and that I needed to use the proceeds from closing the Maas APS to complete those deals. After further discussion between Terry Maas and me (that Schembri heard as he sat in my office), we agreed to extend the closing of the Maas APS on the condition that 172 receive a non-refundable deposit in the amount of $6,000,000 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;$6 Million Non-Refundable Deposit&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>188.</BOLD> To the best of my recollection, Volpini papered the deal for the $6 Million Non-Refundable Deposit. Copies of the documents evidencing the papering of this deal are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;78&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>189.</BOLD> After Terry Maas and I had agreed to extend the Maas APS on the condition that Maas pay the $6 Million Non-Refundable Deposit, Schembri, Patterson and I gathered in the boardroom of Jamesway's office and discussed how to receive the $6 Million NonRefundable Deposit.</P>
<P><BOLD>190.</BOLD> During the course of this discussion, we asked Crozier to join us to discuss our anticipated receipt of the $6 Million Non-Refundable Deposit and our need to use some of those funds to complete the acquisition of the Oshawa Lands.</P>
<P><BOLD>191.</BOLD> Upon hearing from Crozier, Schembri and I then agreed to put the $6 Million Non-Refundable Deposit into an account of Premier at the Bank of Montreal so that these funds would be readily available to complete the purchases of the Oshawa Lands.</P>
<P><BOLD>192.</BOLD> This is what Schembri and I agreed; and this is what we did.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>28</N><TI>Triumph Completes Purchase of Oshawa Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>193.</BOLD> Following execution by Schembri of various waivers, amendments, extensions and assignments, Simcoe &amp; Eastwood completed the acquisition of the Oshawa Lands on or about February 27, 2009. Copies of these documents along with the reporting letters of Volpini are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;79&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>194.</BOLD> In connection with the acquisition of the Oshawa Lands, Schembri executed a resolution dated February, 2009 authorizing the acquisition of the Oshawa Lands. A copy of this resolution is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;80&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>195.</BOLD> The acquisition of the Oshawa Lands on or about February 26, 2009 by Simcoe &amp; Eastwood was funded by $1,859,535.86 from the $6m Non-refundable Deposit in accordance with the Rollover Agreement.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>29</N><TI>Loans to Schembri</TI>
<P><BOLD>196.</BOLD> I addressed the Schembri Loans in my affidavit sworn March 14, 2012 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way March 2012 Affidavit&rdquo;).</BOLD> I repeat and rely on the Way March 2012 Affidavit in opposition to the ROFR SJ Motion.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>30</N><TI>Closing of Maas APS</TI>
<P><BOLD>197.</BOLD> I am informed by Patterson and believe that she assisted Terry Maas in securing financing from Laurentian Bank so he would be able to complete the Maas APS. Copies of the documents evidencing the assistance provided by Patterson in this regard are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;81&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>198.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 23 above, Volpini was the lawyer for 172 in connection with the JV Project. By email sent March 11, 2009 to Patterson, Volpini advised that the &ldquo;[t]ime in the file is up to 237 hours at present&rdquo; and he &ldquo;intend[sj to use a reduced hourly rate of $325 to come up with the final account&rdquo;. Copies of this email and the invoicing rendered by Volpini for his services in this regard are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;82&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>199.</BOLD> On the eve of closing, I learned that MIK had registered a construction lien against title to 345 King (the <BOLD>&ldquo;MIK Lien&rdquo;)</BOLD>. I immediately arranged for funds, and drove to Toronto with Patterson and paid them into court to discharge the MIK Lien.</P>
<P><BOLD>200.</BOLD> On or about March 19, 2009, 172 completed the sale of 345 King to Maas (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Maas Closing&rdquo;)</BOLD>. Copies of the documents relating to the Maas Closing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;83&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>201.</BOLD> As shown on the Trust Ledger Statement dated March 19, 2009 (forming part of Exhibit &ldquo;84&rdquo;), Volpini retained $2,076,589 in Trust, broken down as follows:
<P1>(a) $787,500 pending resolution of the real estate commission;</P1>
<P1>(b) $75,556 pending supply and installation of chattels (namely, the stoves and fridges);</P1>
<P1>(c) $375,000 pending rectification of all deficiencies (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Deficiencies Holdback&rdquo;);</BOLD> and</P1>
<P1>(d) $838,533 being the construction lien holdback (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Construction Lien Holdback&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>

<P><BOLD>203.</BOLD> Copies of the documents relating to the release of $75,556 pending supply and installation of the stoves and fridges are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;85&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>204.</BOLD> Copies of the documents relating to the Deficiencies Holdback and the release thereof are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;86&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>205.</BOLD> Copies of the documents relating to the Construction Lien Holdback and the release thereof are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;87&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>31</N><TI>Triumph Completes Purchase of London Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>206.</BOLD> Following execution by Schembri of various amendments, a waiver and an assignment, Oxford &amp; First completed the acquisition of the London Lands on or about March 31, 2009. Copies of these documents along with the reporting letter of Volpini are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;88&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>207.</BOLD> In connection with the acquisition of the London Lands, Schembri executed a resolution dated March 31, 2009 authorizing the acquisition of the London Lands. A copy of this resolution is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;89&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>208.</BOLD> The acquisition of the London Lands by Oxford &amp; First was funded as follows:
<P1>(a) $800,000 by a vendor takeback mortgage granted to Fanshawe Gates Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Fanshawe Gates&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(b) $250,000 from KFI as follows:

<P1>(c) $300,000 on or about March 6, 2009 from the $6m Non-refundable Deposit; and</P1>
<P1>(d) the balance of $2,222,509.07 on or about March 31, 2009 from the sale proceeds of 345 King in accordance with the Rollover Agreement.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>32</N><TI>Request for Contribution to Triumph</TI>
<P><BOLD>209.</BOLD> Following the closing of the Maas APS, I had Crozier estimate the required contribution to Triumph from Schembri and me: (a) based on the estimated profit from the JV Project; and (b) having regard to our contribution pursuant to the Rollover Agreement. By email sent March 26, 2009, I forwarded Crozier's estimate to Schembri. A copy of this email is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;90&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>210.</BOLD> I recall following up with Schembri to sign off on the change orders as the year end of May 31<SUP>st</SUP> was approaching.</P>
<P><BOLD>211.</BOLD> I invited Schembri to join me and my fishing buddies on our annual fishing trip in June, 2009 to the Spanish River. Schembri brought his boat and his dad. I believe Schembri and his dad enjoyed the fishing trip with me and my fishing buddies.</P>
<P><BOLD>212.</BOLD> I followed up with Schembri from time to time about Schembri:
<P1>(a) repaying the Schembri Loans;</P1>

<P><BOLD>213.</BOLD> At some point, Schembri asked to take the change order binders for the JV Project home over the weekend. Schembri then proceeded to keep these binders for around three months.</P>

<BLOCK1><N>35</N><TI>KFMG</TI>
<P><BOLD>221.</BOLD> In or around September, 2009, Schembri retained KPMG Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;KPMG&rdquo;)</BOLD> to review the documents for the JV Project. I met with representatives of KPMG at Jamesway's offices, and they were provided copies and/or given access to documents relating to the JV Project.</P>
<P><BOLD>222.</BOLD> At a meeting on November 16, 2009 at KPMG's offices, I received a document prepared by KPMG that summarized and reconciled the job costs for 345 King. I compared the KPMG summary to a similar document my office prepared. I noticed there were variances between some of the amounts in the KPMG summary and those in our summary.</P>
<P><BOLD>223.</BOLD> I asked questions about those variances while circling the corresponding amounts in our summary. One of the questions I asked related to the incomplete listing of change orders in the KPMG summary, which amounted to a total variance of approximately $330,000. Schembri responded by saying he approved of change orders for the subs but not for any of my companies. Schembri pre-empted further discussion by grabbing the KPMG summary out of my hand and terminating the meeting.</P>
<P><BOLD>224.</BOLD> Copies of documents relating to the involvement of KPMG are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;99&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>36</N><TI>Schembri Retains Counsel</TI>
<P><BOLD>225.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 85 of the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit, Schembri retained James Wortzman <BOLD>(&ldquo;Wortzman&rdquo;)</BOLD> at Teplitsky, Colson LLP, who sent a letter dated November 25, 2009. In that letter, Wortzman alleged that 172 had &ldquo;failed to provide a full and final accurate accounting to [Schembri] of all profits&rdquo;. As Schembri knew, a &ldquo;full and final&rdquo; accounting could not be prepared as:
<P1>(a) Schembri had not &ldquo;signed off&rdquo; on the change orders; and</P1>
<P1>(b) neither the City nor Maas had &ldquo;signed-off&rdquo; on the completion of the &ldquo;permitted building&rdquo;.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>37</N><TI>Schembri Commences Litigation</TI>
<P><BOLD>226.</BOLD> Schembri commenced the Main Action in Toronto in February, 2010. The Main Action was transferred to Kitchener in 2011. Schembri has been represented throughout by Wortzman.</P>
<P><BOLD>227.</BOLD> The Main Action is defended. I (along with my companies) am represented by Heath Whiteley <BOLD>(&ldquo;Whiteley&rdquo;),</BOLD> formerly of Gowlings LLP <BOLD>(&ldquo;Gowlings&rdquo;)</BOLD> in Toronto and now a sole practitioner. Whiteley has been involved in the Main Action since the fall of 2010. Patterson is now represented by Richard Campbell in Waterloo, following the retirement of Gary Petker. The Way Family Trust has been represented throughout by Ian Hull at Hull &amp; Hull in Toronto.</P>
<P><BOLD>228.</BOLD> In addition to defending the Main Action, I have asserted a counterclaim, initially in part, to the effect that Schembri Financial and Schembri breached the Shareholder Agreement by failing to comply with the right of first refusal (in the ROFR Clause) so as to allow me to participate in the acquisition and development of other properties located in Waterloo Region. The damages suffered by me resulting from Schembri's breach of the ROFR Provisions subsequently became the subject matter of the ROFR Action.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>38</N><TI>MIK Litigation</TI>
<P><BOLD>229.</BOLD> aDupuis represented Jamesway in responding to the statement of claim of MIK in connection with the MIK Lien (the <BOLD>&ldquo;MIK Litigation&rdquo;).</BOLD> Ultimately, the MIK Litigation was concluded in favour of Jamesway, with the claim of MIK being dismissed and the counterclaim of Jamesway being granted. Copies of the documents relating to the disposition of the MIK Litigation are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;100&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>230.</BOLD> I am informed by Patterson and believe that she obtained the cell phone records for the cell phone number provided to Dupuis and paid for by Jamesway. I am further informed by Patterson and believe that these records show calls between Dupuis and Schembri in late January and early February, 2010.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>39</N><TI>Directors' Meeting re Triumph and Simcoe &amp; Eastwood</TI>
<P><BOLD>231.</BOLD> Under cover of letter dated April 7, 2010 from my counsel to counsel for Schembri, notices were sent for:
<P1>(a) a Meeting of the Directors of Triumph; and</P1>
<P1>(b) a Meeting of the Directors of Simcoe &amp; Eastwood;</P1>
to be held on April 12, 2010 at Volpini's offices. A copy ofthis letter and the enclosures thereto are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;101&rdquo;.</BOLD> Copies of the minutes of these two board meetings are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;102&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>232.</BOLD> I learned subsequently that Schembri had acquired and was developing a property municipally known as 33 Taylorwood Road, Oshawa (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Taylorwood Property&rdquo;)</BOLD> at that time of the Director's Meeting. The Taylorwood Property is located approximately four hundred feet (400') from the Oshawa Lands. Copies of documents evidencing Schembri's interest in the Taylorwood Property and its' subsequent sale are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;103&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>233.</BOLD> Schembri did not disclose his interest in the Taylorwood Property to me, or to the Court in connection with his receivership motion. Accordingly, I believe Schembri acted in bad faith in attempting to block development of the Oshawa Lands until he completed his development of the Taylorwood Property.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>40</N><TI>Demand for Contribution to Triumph</TI>
<P><BOLD>234.</BOLD> By Notice of Payment of Liabilities of Triumph dated May 2, 2010, I caused Triumph to issue a demand for contribution pursuant to the Financing Clause in an effort to compel Schembri to pay the amount necessary to get the 45/55 split balanced so that we were both carrying our share. Contrary to Schembri's allegations, I did so to compel Schembri to pay and not to seize Schembri's shares.</P>
<P><BOLD>235.</BOLD> Schembri refused to pay. I did not seize his shares.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>41</N><TI>Schembri Blocks Arbitration</TI>
<P><BOLD>236.</BOLD> In furtherance of the arbitration provision in paragraph 15 of the Shareholder Agreement, I caused Triumph to serve a Notice Demanding Arbitration dated June 25, 2010 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Arbitration Notice&rdquo;),</BOLD> leading to an exchange of correspondence between counsel for Schembri and my counsel regarding the Arbitration Notice, and then service of a Notice of Motion by counsel for Schembri. A copy of the Arbitration Notice along with the correspondence exchanged in connection therewith is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;104&rdquo;.</BOLD> A copy of the Notice of Motion served by counsel for Schembri is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;105&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>237.</BOLD> I learned subsequently that Schembri did not swear the affidavit referenced in his Notice of Motion. A copy of the correspondence sent by Whiteley to counsel for Schembri on July 25, 2011 and August 31, 2011 evidencing what I learned subsequently is attached and marked hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;106&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>42</N><TI>The Receivership Motion</TI>
<P><BOLD>238.</BOLD> On a motion by Schembri, Madam Justice Roberts appointed a receiver (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Receiver&rdquo;)</BOLD> over the Triumph Lands. In the Reasons of Madam Justice Roberts dated September 24, 2010, her Honour made several adverse findings against me, with the caveat at paragraph 38 as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>&ldquo;While there is strong prima facie evidence that the defendants' conduct has been inappropriate and possibly egregious</EM>, <BOLD><EM>as this is an interlocutory proceeding, I have not made any final conclusions concerning their behaviour. It is therefore premature for me at this stage to award substantial indemnity costs on the basis of facts that have not yet been finally determined</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>239.</BOLD> Contrary to her Honour's various adverse findings:
<P1>(a) the evidence provided by Schembri was disputed;</P1>
<P1>(b) I did not grossly inflate the amounts of various changes as alleged by Dupuis under oath;</P1>
<P1>(c) I did not add to change orders hundreds of hours for labour that were not expended on the JV Project;</P1>
<P1>(d) the vast majority of the work was not carried out by the Way Group; and</P1>
<P1>(e) there was no improper transfer of $6 million to Premier.</P1></P>
<P>I address each of the foregoing erroneous findings below.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Evidence Disputed</TI>
<P><BOLD>240.</BOLD> In paragraph 6 of my affidavit sworn May 14, 2010 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way May 2010 Affidavit&rdquo;)</BOLD> in response to the Schembri April 2010 Affidavit, I stated the following:
<QUOTE><P><EM>I disagree with the truth and accuracy of many of the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; put forward by the</EM> [Schembri April 2010 Affidavit]. <EM>However, for the purposes of these motions, I only put forward contrary evidence with respect to those untruths and inaccuracies that may bear upon the issues raised by these motions and those that are most offensive to me. A failure to challengeor contradict the</EM> [Schembri April 2010 Affidavit] <EM>here does not mean that I agree with or accept the evidence put forth by the</EM> [Schembri April 2010 Affidavit]. (italics added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>I then proceeded to dispute numerous aspects of Schembri's evidence. A copy of the Way May 2010 Affidavit is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;107&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Dupuis' Evidence re Change Orders</TI>
<P><BOLD>241.</BOLD> I did not grossly inflate the amounts of various change orders by adding:
<P1>(a) unauthorized and excessive administrative fees; or</P1>
<P1>(b) hundreds of hours for labour that were not expended on the JV Project.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>242.</BOLD> Change orders were prepared by various employees of Jamesway. It is my practice to instruct Jamesway employees to make sure that they capture all costs associated with a change order.</P>
<P><BOLD>243.</BOLD> I am informed by Crozier that Jonas is able to generate a report detailing the hours spent by Jamesway employees; as well as other reports showing costs incurred to third parties. A copy of the Jonas report detailing the hours spent by Jamesway employees in connection with the change order is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;108&rdquo;.</BOLD> This report was provided previously in an answer to an undertaking.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Majority of Work on the JV Project Was Performed by Third Parties</TI>
<P><BOLD>244.</BOLD> As I stated in paragraph 17 of the Way May 2010 Affidavit, &ldquo;the vast majority of the construction of the [JV] Project was carried out by third party contractors&rdquo;. Schembri knows this.</P>
<P><BOLD>245.</BOLD> Certain of the construction work performed by the Way Group as agreed to around the commencement of construction in March, 2008 is set out in the table below:

</P>
<P>A copy of the First Report dated January 20, 2011 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;111&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Claims Procedure</TI>
<P><BOLD>255.</BOLD> The Receiver conducted a claims procedure (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Claims Procedure&rdquo;)</BOLD> pursuant to an Order dated January 28, 2011 issued on consent (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Claims Procedure Order&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the Claims Procedure Order is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;112&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>256.</BOLD> I caused seventeen unsecured claims to be filed, which were contained in a four volume claims brief that total 1,272 pages in pdf format (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Claims Brief&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>257.</BOLD> Included among the seventeen claims were six claims filed by KFI and 172 in respect of funds they advanced through to the Triumph Subsidiaries (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Tracing Claims&rdquo;).</BOLD> In the Way Claims Brief, the Way Tracing Claims were illustrated in spreadsheets prepared by Crozier and supported by various banking records, including cancelled cheques assembled by Crozier. Copies of these spreadsheets are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;113&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>258.</BOLD> Following a request for clarification by the Receiver, I caused a supplementary claims brief (that totals 98 pages in pdf format) to be prepared and provided to the Receiver (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Supplementary Way Claims Brief&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>259.</BOLD> A copy of the Way Claims Brief and the Supplementary Way Claims Brief will be filed separately as they consist of nearly 1,400 pages.</P>
<P><BOLD>260.</BOLD> The Receiver reported to the Court with respect to the Claims Procedure in the Fifth Report dated June 17, 2011 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Fifth Report&rdquo;).</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 8 of the Fifth Report, the Receiver summarized &ldquo;<EM>the claims received, the Receiver's disallowances and revisions, disputed disallowances, and claims that have been accepted by the Receiver (in original or amended form) following disallowance and dispute</EM>&rdquo; in Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Fifth Report. A copy of Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Fifth Report is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;114&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>261.</BOLD> In January, 2012, my counsel and counsel for Schembri exchanged copies of the claims documentation filed with the Receiver by their respective clients; namely, my counsel sent the Way Claims Brief and Supplementary Way Claims Brief and received the claim documentation filed by Schembri (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri Claims&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the Schembri Claims is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;115&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>262.</BOLD> I reviewed the Schembri Claims. I found them confusing as:
<P1>(a) certain claims had multiple claimants which appear to be inconsistent with the supporting documentation;</P1>
<P1>(b) the same amount was initially sought on the same basis in separate claims against each of the Triumph Subsidiaries;</P1>
<P1>(c) certain claims were subsequently amended; and</P1>
<P1>(d) the same debt appeared in separate claims initially made by different claimants, and then subsequently amended to be claimed twice by the same claimant.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>263.</BOLD> I also found certain of the Schembri Claims lacking because:
<P1>(a) the sole supporting documentation were invoices dated March 11, 2011 (being a week prior to the claims bar date); and/or</P1>
<P1>(b) no supporting documentation evidencing payments for which reimbursement was being sought was provided.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>264.</BOLD> Finally, I learned that certain of the Schembri Claims were clearly improper as:
<P1>(a) a claim for $3,148.18 had already been reimbursed, with the proof of such reimbursement being contained in the Way Claims Brief; and</P1>
<P1>(b) a claim for $20,000 related to a deposit paid by one of my companies and not Schembri.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>265.</BOLD> I addressed the Schembri Claims in my affidavits sworn January 31, 2012 and March 14, 2012. Copies of these affidavits are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;116&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>266.</BOLD> The Receiver accepted that the Schembri Claims in paragraph 265 above were improper.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Motion re Oshawa Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>267.</BOLD> During the course of the receivership proceedings, Schembri brought a motion seeking an order compelling me to guarantee construction financing for the development of the Oshawa Lands by the Receiver.</P>
<P><BOLD>268.</BOLD> By Endorsement dated July 18, 2011, Justice Mesbur dismissed Schembri's motion and awarded me costs in the amount of $37,500, all inclusive. A copy of this endorsement is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;117&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Sale of the Triumph Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>269.</BOLD> Contrary to paragraph 42 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, I did submit an offer&mdash;an en bloc credit bid offer&mdash;that would have preserved the claims of creditors in full (including myself) while recognizing the more than $2 million KFI had contributed to the Triumph Subisidiaries (as shown in the Way Claims Brief) as compared to the thousands of dollars Schembri and his companies had contributed. A copy of an article about credit bids in Canadian insolvencies is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;118&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>270.</BOLD> Ultimately, the Triumph Lands were sold by the Receiver to:
<P1>(a) Schembri (Waterloo and London) as addressed in the Sixth Report; and</P1>
<P1>(b) me (Oshawa) as addressed in the Supplement to the Sixth Report;</P1>
resulting in significant losses. I believe Schembri developed the Waterloo Lands, but simply &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; the London Lands. I developed the Oshawa Lands.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Opposition to the Fees of the Receiver and its Counsel</TI>
<P><BOLD>271.</BOLD> In the Seventh Report dated October 14, 2011, the Receiver sought approval of the fees of the Receiver and counsel to the Receiver totaling more than $400,000 for the period from February 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Fee Approval Request&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>272.</BOLD> I did not oppose the Fee Approval Request.</P>
<P><BOLD>273.</BOLD> Schembri opposed the Fee Approval Request. Schembri swore an affidavit dated October 18, 2011, which prompted: (a) the Receiver to prepare additional materials (namely, the Supplement to the Seventh Report and a factum); and (b) me to swear an affidavit dated October 19, 2011.</P>
<P><BOLD>274.</BOLD> At the hearing of the Fee Approval Request on October 20, 2011, Justice Mesbur did not permit the plaintiffs to file the affidavit sworn by Schembri as her Honour ruled that &ldquo;<EM>it was totally unfair to attempt to do so at such a late date</EM>&rdquo; when the hearing date had been scheduled three months earlier. A copy of the handwritten endorsement of Justice Mesbur dated October 20, 2011 (along with a best efforts transcription by Whiteley) is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;119&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Receivership Financial Position</TI>
<P><BOLD>275.</BOLD> I have attempted to summarize in the table below the interim statement of receipts and disbursements as of December 31, 2011 (being Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Eighth Report dated February 1, 2012) following the sale of the Triumph Lands:

<P>A copy of Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Eighth Report is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;120&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>276.</BOLD> Subsequently, the Receiver distributed approximately $165,000 to the third party unsecured creditors (in accordance with the amounts shown in Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the Eighth Report) leaving approximately $3,300,000 in total in the three receivership estates.</P>
<P><BOLD>277.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 46 above, I swore two affidavits in connection with the Eighth Report. Schembri also swore two affidavits (namely, on February 29 and March 30, 2012).</P>
<P><BOLD>278.</BOLD> Shortly thereafter the Receivership Proceedings became dormant while the parties attempted, without success, to reach an agreement that would provide for the discharge of the Receiver.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Error re Title to the Waterloo Lands</TI>
<P><BOLD>279.</BOLD> Following a nine-month dormancy, the Receiver submitted the Ninth Report dated January 29, 2013 in order to rectify Schembri's failure to include a piece of property in his offer for the Waterloo Lands that the Receiver subsequently accepted following court approval. I sought to protect the interests of the Way Group by requiring Schembri to bear the costs of the Receiver and its' counsel in connection with that motion as it appeared to result from Schembri's mistake. Ultimately a compromise was reached following a court attendance, and the Order of Justice Brown dated February 1, 2013 was issued subsequently. Copies of the documents evidencing the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;121&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>280.</BOLD> To my knowledge there have been no further steps taken in the Receivership Proceedings. The Receiver continues to hold more than $3,000,000 following its' sale of the Triumph Lands that had cost the Triumph Subsidiaries more than $8,000,000 to acquire and commence development.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Settlement Offers Prior to Appointment of the Receiver</TI>
<P><BOLD>281.</BOLD> In the end, Schembri acquired the Waterloo Property and the London Property, while I acquired the Oshawa Property. This is precisely the division of properties that I proposed in my Offer to Settle dated April 21, 2010 and my amended Offer to Settle dated June 3, 2010. Copies of these offers are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;122&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>282.</BOLD> Had Schembri accepted either of these offers, the receivership would not have happened, and the dissipation of approximately $5,000,000<SUP>6</SUP> in value would not have occurred.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>44</N><TI>Documentary Disclosure</TI>
<P><BOLD>283.</BOLD> Schembri swore an affidavit of documents on October 6, 2010 listing 181 documents in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; and no documents in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri AoD&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the Schembri AoD is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;123&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>284.</BOLD> In December, 2010, my counsel provided copies of the financial records of 172 in connection with the JV Project on a CD to counsel for Schembri. These 5,451 documents would later form Schedule A.l to my affidavit of documents sworn June 15, 2012 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Main Action AoD&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>285.</BOLD> In January, 2011, my counsel provided copies of: (a) the detailed cost ledger reports; (b) the backup documents; and (c) the time sheets of the then defendant corporations and related entities; in connection with the JV Project on a DVD to counsel for Schembri. These 3,421 documents would later form Schedule A.2 to the Way Main Action AoD.</P>
<P><BOLD>286.</BOLD> In addition to those 8,872 documents, I am informed by Crozier and believe that Schembri's financial advisor, KPMG, was provided access in January, 2011 through a portal (the <BOLD>&ldquo;KPMG Portal&rdquo;)</BOLD> using one of two user IDs to certain companies as follows:
<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>6. Acquisition, carrying and development costs less funds held by the Receiver following the sale of the Triumph Lands.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) User ID: KPMG&mdash;purchase orders, job costing and subcontract control for JCC, PPC, 2081044 and 172; and</P1>
<P1>(b) User ID: KMPG 2&mdash;access to general ledger, accounts payable, purchase orders, job costing and subcontract control for 172.</P1></P>
<P>I am further informed by Crozier and believe that she checked within the past six months and determined that KPMG had not used the portal since the spring of 2011.</P>
<P><BOLD>287.</BOLD> Schedule A.3 of the Way Main Action AoD consists of 10,526 documents. Compiling these 10,526 documents took a lot of time by a lot of people at significant cost.</P>
<P><BOLD>288.</BOLD> I have not attached a copy of Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the Way Main Action AoD as it consists of 1,090 pages.</P>
<P><BOLD>289.</BOLD> I was informed by Clifford Cole <BOLD>(&ldquo;Cole&rdquo;)</BOLD>, a lawyer at Gowlings in Toronto, and believe that I incurred significant expense in having my Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; productions inputted into Summation between January, 2011 and June, 2012, with:
<P1>(a) scanning and coding performed by Records Managements Services Group at a cost of $33,656.84 (exclusive of H.S.T.); and</P1>
<P1>(b) clerical costs exceeding $100,000 (exclusive of the time spent reviewing documents for privilege and relevance).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>290.</BOLD> I note Schembri had years to take similar steps but elected not to do so. I am not aware of any explanation being given by Schembri for not doing so.</P>
<P><BOLD>291.</BOLD> Schembri swore a supplementary affidavit of documents on August 1, 2012 listing:
<P1>(a) 146 documents in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; (of which only 4 documents appear to be dated after the Schembri AoD); and</P1>
<P1>(b) 2 documents in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; (that were listed Schedule A.3 of the Way Main Action AoD but not in the Schembri AoD);</P1>
(the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri Supplementary AoD&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the Schembri Supplementary AoD is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;124&rdquo;.</BOLD> Copies of the two documents in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; will be provided separately at the hearing of the motion.</P>
<P><BOLD>292.</BOLD> Schembri did not provide his Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; productions in Summation format, and as a result I incurred a cost of $1,731.62 (exclusive H.S.T.) in having his Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; productions scanned and coded.</P>
<P><BOLD>293.</BOLD> During a court attendance on January 8, 2016,1 learned that the Court expressed the view that Schembri ought to receive my Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; productions in Summation format without making any contribution upfront and without having to explain why he had not done so himself. I acquiesced to this view as I wanted the Main Action to be set down for trial as soon as possible, and was relieved by the offer of case management which I had requested unsuccessfully in or around early 2011.</P>
<P><BOLD>294.</BOLD> In the last sentence of paragraph 19 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, Schembri alleges that I have:
<QUOTE><P><EM>&ldquo;refused to provide full and accurate financial disclosure and continues to refuse as of the date of this pleading</EM>. <BOLD><EM>To this date, notwithstanding being ordered by this Honourable Court to do so, Way had not done so</EM>.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>This is not true. Schembri has alleged this untruth from time to time. Previously, Schembri alleged this untruth in early 2014, and my counsel responded and politely requested particulars but received no response. Copies of the correspondence exchanged between Wortzman and Cole at that time in connection with this untruth are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;125&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Deficient Documentary Disclosure</TI>
<P><BOLD>295.</BOLD> I believe Schembri has failed to produce numerous relevant documents.</P>
<P><BOLD>296.</BOLD> The five-page document containing 35 paragraphs (marked as Exhibit &ldquo;115&rdquo;) asserts:
<P1>(a) in paragraph 25 that Leaf is owed $35,414.20 for construction services but produces no contract for such services or time sheets for either Tony Varriano or Schembri's father; and</P1>
<P1>(b) in paragraphs 27 and 30 that Schembri is owed $21,581.47 and Leaf is owed $24,387, respectively, but produces no invoices or evidence of payment.</P1></P>
<P>Regarding (b), I believe these claims relate to the same thing given the description and as the Leaf claim is exactly the amount of the Schembri claim plus tax. Regarding the &ldquo;Schedule&rdquo; marked as Tab 2, I am informed by Crozier and believe that she created this document based on what Schembri told her and that he did not provide supporting documents in some instances despite her requests for him to do so.</P>
<P><BOLD>297.</BOLD> The page marked as Tab 1 located in Exhibit &ldquo;115&rdquo; asserts that Schembri paid in connection with the JV Project:
<P1>(a) legal fees totaling almost $5,000 in connection with 341 King, 349 King and 340 Spruce;</P1>
<P1>(b) a commission in the amount of $10,700 in connection with Mario Schembri's purchase of 345 King;</P1>
<P1>(c) $25,000 for &ldquo;Property Maintenance (snow, grass, repairs, insur ect)&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(d) legal fees in the amount of $4,280 for &ldquo;transfer into JV&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>There are no documents in the Schembri Claims that support or evidence the foregoing payments. Further, there is nothing listed in either the Schembri AoD or the Schembri Supplementary AoD that supports or evidences any of the foregoing payments other than (b); namely, the trust ledger statement relating to Mario Schembri's purchase of 345 King. Finally, regarding (c), Schembri did not make any payments on account of property taxes as stated in paragraph 81 above.</P>
<P><BOLD>298.</BOLD> Further to paragraph 223, the KPMG summary Schembri grabbed out of my hand is not listed in either the Schembri AoD or the Schembri Supplementary AoD. In addition, Schembri has objected to KPMG producing its working papers that have existed since November 13, 2009 despite my repeated efforts to obtain these documents in accordance with KPMG's letter dated November 13, 2009.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>45</N><TI>Amendments to Statement of Claim</TI>
<P><BOLD>299.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 26 above, the plaintiffs commenced the within action in February 2010, and have subsequently amended their pleading on two separate occasions.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The First Amendment</TI>
<P><BOLD>300.</BOLD> In or around December, 2010, the plaintiffs brought a motion (the <BOLD>&ldquo;First Amendment Motion&rdquo;)</BOLD> to amend the Statement of Claim to, among other things:
<P1>(a) add the Other Way Companies, Patterson and the Way Family Trust; and</P1>
<P1>(b) compel me to guarantee financing in connection with the Triumph Lands.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>301.</BOLD> During the course of this motion, my counsel engaged Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP <BOLD>(&ldquo;Deloitte&rdquo;)</BOLD> to investigate the allegation by Schembri that the Way Group misappropriated funds. By report dated April 25, 2011 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Deloitte Report&rdquo;)</BOLD>, Deloitte determined:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Based on our initial review and analysis of the supporting documentation the proceeds of sale of 345 King would appear to be adequately accounted for. At this point in our analysis we could find no evidence of payments made directly to Al Way</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>The costs incurred by the Triumph project entities appear to be related to the development of the particular project and relate primarily to the purchase of the land, permits and licenses, consulting fees for design and development and financing charges. The books and records of the Al Way related companies that we reviewed would appear to be in good order and at this point in our engagement</EM> <BOLD><EM>we could find no evidence of inappropriate transactions</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The Deloitte Report was provided to counsel for Schembri on or about April 25, 2011. A copy of the Deloitte Report is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;126&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>302.</BOLD> By endorsement dated June 29, 2011 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Turnbull Decision&rdquo;),</BOLD> Justice Turnbull:
<P1>(a) granted leave to add the Other Way Companies;</P1>
<P1>(b) dismissed the motion to add the Way Family Trust and Patterson &ldquo;but without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs to renew the motion if there is evidence which may support the allegations as presented&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c) limited the amendment sought to guarantee financing only in connection with the Oshawa Lands as to allow otherwise &ldquo;would constitute an abuse of the court in that they would be a collateral attack on an existing court order&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>A copy of the Turnbull Decision is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;127&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>303.</BOLD> Justice Turnbull discussed the Deloitte Report in paragraphs 24 to 28 of the Turnbull Decision, including stating at paragraph [24]:
<QUOTE><P><EM>It is clear from the record that KPMG have been retained by the plaintiffs to undertake an analysis of the Defendants' books and records as much as a year ago. To this date, for some reason not clear from the record, a report has not been produced</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>In fact, Schembri retained KPMG in September, 2009. Now more than eight years later, the plaintiffs have still not produced any report by KPMG.</P>
<P><BOLD>304.</BOLD> Schembri appealed the dismissal of the motion to add the Way Family Trust and Patterson (but not the limitation in paragraph 303 (c) above), but did so tardily. The Court of Appeal granted the plaintiffs' appeal. Copies of the documents evidencing the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;128&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>305.</BOLD> Eventually, counsel for Schembri arranged for the <UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim amended December 4, 2012.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Second Amendment</TI>
<P><BOLD>306.</BOLD> By letter dated October 2, 2012 enclosing a draft &ldquo;<UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim ... in furtherance of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal&rdquo;, counsel for Schembri advised of four additional paragraphs he was also seeking to include.</P>
<P><BOLD>307.</BOLD> By email sent November 8, 2012, my counsel requested particulars in respect of one of the four paragraphs.</P>
<P><BOLD>308.</BOLD> Under cover of letter dated November 8, 2012, counsel for Schembri served a motion record returnable November 22, 2012 seeking to further amend the Statement of Claim (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Second Amendment Motion&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>309.</BOLD> My counsel prepared and delivered responding motion materials. I was informed by Tina Resendes <BOLD>(&ldquo;Resendes&rdquo;),</BOLD> a law clerk at Gowlings LLP in Kitchener, and believed that she could not file my responding materials as the Second Amendment Motion had not been filed by Schembri.</P>
<P><BOLD>310.</BOLD> Following an exchange of correspondence, counsel for Schembri provided a revised paragraph containing particulars under cover of letter dated December 17, 2012.</P>
<P><BOLD>311.</BOLD> The proposed revised paragraph stated &ldquo;... Particulars of those fraudulent claims are set out in Tab D of the Receiver's Eighth Reprot [sic] dated February 1, 2012&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BOLD>312.</BOLD> I have compared Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the Eighth Report dated February 1, 2012 to Appendix &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Fifth Report dated June 17, 2011 (attached hereto and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;114&rdquo;). They appear to be identical.</P>
<P><BOLD>313.</BOLD> By email sent December 21, 2012, my counsel responded to the proposed revised paragraph and indicated those claims that ought not to be listed given the Claims Procedure carried out by the Receiver, on consent, and participated in by Schembri and me, at significant expense. I believe this was another attempt by Schembri to perpetuate an abuse of court by collaterally attacking the Claims Procedure Order.</P>
<P><BOLD>314.</BOLD> Following an Order dated June 3, 2013 dismissing the Main Action for delay (the &ldquo;Dismissal Order&rdquo;), by letter dated June 7, 2013 counsel for Schembri requested the defendants consent to setting aside the Dismissal Order and proposed a new timetable.</P>
<P><BOLD>315.</BOLD> I consented promptly to setting aside the Dismissal Order. The agreement on a new timetable took more time. As a result of the discussions and subsequent Second Timetable Order (defined in paragraph 323 below), I set aside the weeks of November 25 and December 2, 2013 for examinations for discovery and arranged for my absence from my business.</P>
<P><BOLD>316.</BOLD> Copies of the documents referred to in paragraphs 307 to 315 above are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;129&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>317.</BOLD> Eventually, counsel for Schembri arranged for the <UNDER>Amended Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim amended October 2, 2013.</P>
<P><BOLD>318.</BOLD> I compared paragraph 86A of the <UNDER>Amended Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim to what my counsel proposed on December 21, 2012 and see that the two are identical.</P>
<P><BOLD>319.</BOLD> The plaintiffs are seeking damages, among other relief, in the <UNDER>Amended Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim that I have attempted to summarize in the table below:

<P>A copy of the foregoing correspondence is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;133&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>326.</BOLD> I was informed by Cole and believed that he and Wortzman agreed that discoveries in the Main Action would be held in July and August, 2014. I then set aside those dates in my calendar and arranged for my absence from my business.</P>
<P><BOLD>327.</BOLD> I was also informed by Cole and believed that Wortzman represented that Schembri would be bringing a motion for summary judgment in the ROFR Action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Purported Schembri ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>328.</BOLD> I have reviewed the correspondence attached hereto and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;133&rdquo; and note the following:
<P1><BOLD>Wortzman's letter dated May 26, 2014</BOLD></P1>
<QUOTE><P><EM>We have instructions now to bring a motion for summary judgment seeking a dismissal of [the ROFR Action]</EM>.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><EM>Our motion for summary judgement can be served within the next two or three weeks. Accordingly, if Ms. Gupta can advise as to a potential return date we can agree upon a timetable for that motion</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Wortzman's letter dated June 4, 2014</BOLD></P1>
<QUOTE><P><EM>I will endeavour to serve our Motion Record regarding summary judgment...by June 20, 2014. Once that Motion Record is served we will discuss how long you need to file responding material and the timetable required for the motion</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>329.</BOLD> I have also reviewed the letter from Wortzman dated July 9, 2014 (after my counsel served the motion record that led to the Third Timetable Order), and note that Wortzman represented he was &ldquo;<EM>finalizing the motion record for partial summary judgment</EM>&rdquo;. A copy of the letter dated July 9, 2014 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;134&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>330.</BOLD> Despite suggesting otherwise, Schembri did not serve any responding materials or conduct any cross-examination, and the Third Timetable Order was eventually issued on consent, along with the Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Timetable Order&rdquo;).</BOLD> A copy of the ROFR Timetable Order is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;135&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>331.</BOLD> Paragraph 5 of the ROFR Timetable Order imposed a timetable for the conduct of the Purported Schembri ROFR SJ Motion. Schembri did not serve his motion record, and to my knowledge Schembri neither said nor did anything for more than two years in connection with the Purported Schembri ROFR SJ Motion. Accordingly, I believe that Schembri, through Wortzman, deceived me, my counsel and the Court. I further believe that Schembri perpetrated this deceit for the purpose of avoiding his examination for discovery (thereby delaying the Main Action and the ROFR Action) and increasing the amount of costs being incurred by me in defending the Way Group.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>47</N><TI>Examinations for Discovery</TI>
<P><BOLD>332.</BOLD> As provided for in the Third Timetable Order, the examinations for discovery in the Main Action were scheduled to be conducted on December 9 to 19, 2014, inclusive, and January 12 to 16, 2015, inclusive. I had set aside those dates in my calendar back in September and arranged for my absence from my business.</P>
<P><BOLD>333.</BOLD> On or about December 2, 2014, Wortzman notified Cole that he needed to cancel his examination of me scheduled to commence on December 9, 2014 because he did not have copies of my Schedule &ldquo;A.3&rdquo; productions. I note that this was more than two years after delivery of the Way Main Action AoD, and Cole had confirmed in his email sent April 7, 2014 (forming part of Exhibit &ldquo;133&rdquo;) that Wortzman had &ldquo;all the affidavit of documents from the defendants in the main action&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BOLD>334.</BOLD> My counsel acknowledged this notification and promptly provided Wortzman with an USB stick containing a PDF of all 10,526 documents in Schedule A.3, as well as all:
<P1>(a) 5,451 documents in Schedule A.l (which documents had previously been provided on a CD in December, 2010); and</P1>
<P1>(b) 3,421 documents in Schedule A.2 (which documents had previously been provided on a DVD in January, 2011).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>335.</BOLD> My counsel accommodated Wortzman further by providing him with my Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; listing in Excel format, which allowed him to search through the documents using the Excel search functions.</P>
<P><BOLD>336.</BOLD> As a result, I agreed to postpone my examination for discovery until December 15, 2014 provided that:
<P1>(a) mediation be held; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri be discovered the week of January 12, 2015.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>337.</BOLD> As agreed, mediation was held on December 9, 2014.</P>
<P><BOLD>338.</BOLD> Copies of the documents referred to in paragraphs 333 to 336 above are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;136&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>My Examination for Discovery</TI>
<P><BOLD>339.</BOLD> As agreed, my examination for discovery commenced on December 15, 2014. Wortzman examined me for thirteen days over five months, and completed his examination on April 30, 2015. The last three days of my examination were all on dates requested by Wortzman and accommodated by me and my counsel.</P>
<P><BOLD>340.</BOLD> Schembri assisted Wortzman in doing so by using the USB stick and Excel spreadsheets on a laptop Schembri operated.</P>
<P><BOLD>341.</BOLD> Wortzman examined me for discovery not only in the Main Action but also in the ROFR Action. I did not expect him to do so because of his repeated representations about the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, and the fact that the Notice of Examination he served on December 22, 2014 related to the Main Action only. I believe this is just another example of Schembri's tactics.</P>
<P><BOLD>342.</BOLD> According to the transcripts of my examination for discovery, Wortzman asked more than 15,000 questions.</P>
<P><BOLD>343.</BOLD> I do not recall Wortzman putting the Way Claims Brief or the Way Supplementary Claims Brief to me at any time during the thirteen days of my examination. I have reviewed a copy of the list of exhibits to my examination for discovery prepared by Resendes (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way E/D Exhibit List&rdquo;)</BOLD> and do not see either listed thereon. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that Wortzman has not provided copies of certain exhibits in the Way E/D Exhibit List as he agreed to do. A copy of the Way E/D Exhibit List is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;137&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Examinations of Patterson and Farlow</TI>
<P><BOLD>344.</BOLD> The last two days of my examination (namely, April 23 and 30, 2015) had previously been scheduled for the examination of Patterson thereby bumping her examination to June 9 and 10, 2015. Previously, the examination of Farlow had been scheduled for June 4, 2015 but Wortzman had rescheduled it to June 9, 2015.</P>
<P><BOLD>345.</BOLD> It appears to me that Wortzman had now &ldquo;double-booked&rdquo; June 9, 2015. Regardless of the apparent &ldquo;double-booking&rdquo;, the examinations for discovery of Patterson and Farlow had to be rescheduled as Wortzman had not made arrangements with a court reporter's office for June 9 and 10, 2014. A copy of the letter from Wortzman dated May 27, 2015 evidencing his failure to book these examinations is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;138&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>346.</BOLD> Patterson and Farlow accommodated Wortzman in rescheduling these examinations, and they were conducted on August 5, 6 and 7, 2015.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Examination for Discovery of Schembri</TI>
<P><BOLD>347.</BOLD> I expected that Schembri would be examined in the summer of 2015 as:
<P1>(a) the First Timetable Order, the Second Timetable Order and the Third Timetable each provided for all examinations for discovery to be completed by a particular date without regard to answers to undertakings;</P1>
<P1>(b) Wortzman agreed to produce Schembri the week of January 12, 2015 in exchange for my consent to postpone the commencement of my examination for discovery from December 9, 2014 to the week of December 15, 2014; and</P1>
<P1>(c) once Wortzman needed to continue my examination for discovery during the week of January 12, 2015, he provided dates for Schembri's examination in June, 2015.</P1></P>
<P>Regarding (c), a copy of an email sent by Wortzman to Whiteley on January 29, 2015 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;139&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>348.</BOLD> Apparently, Schembri decided to resile from the requirement to attend his examination for discovery, and instead demanded that I first provide answers to my undertakings. I believe Schembri must have known that he was required to attend an examination for discovery prior to receiving my answers to undertakings as he brought a motion seeking relief from his obligation in this regard. A copy of the Notice of Motion returnable May 28, 2015 is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;140&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>349.</BOLD> I did not believe that the Court would permit him to do so, but given his prior successful efforts in avoiding his examination for discovery for years now I was not surprised that he was successful once again and has still not been examined for discovery.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>My Undertakings</TI>
<P><BOLD>350.</BOLD> Compiling the answers to undertakings took more than a year at significant cost as should be apparent from the answers themselves. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that it was most practical to send all answers (or as many as possible) for any particular day rather than piecemeal. I am further informed by Whiteley and believe that his efforts were interrupted when he dislocated his shoulder in February, 2015 for the second time in less than a year.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>My Examination on Answers to Undertakings</TI>
<P><BOLD>351.</BOLD> I addressed my examination on answers to undertakings in my affidavit in the Main Action sworn January 15, 2018. I rely on that affidavit in opposing the ROFR SJ Motion. My counsel will arrange for that affidavit to be pulled from the court file and put before the Court.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>48</N><TI>Revisiting the Dispute</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The JV Profit Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>352.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 73 above, the JV Agreement entitles 172 to determine profit, acting reasonably and in accordance with GAAP.</P>
<P><BOLD>353.</BOLD> 172 has acted reasonably in its efforts to determine profit by:
<P1>(a) using Jonas;</P1>
<P1>(b) retaining Lund &amp; Associates to:
<P2>(i) prepare financial statements; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) prepare and file tax returns.</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) providing the Change Order binders to Schembri for his review, so he may approve or dispute each of the change orders therein;</P1>
<P1>(d) preparing an interim accounting with Schembri's participation (following the closing of the MAAS APS but prior to the completion of all contractual obligations thereunder);</P1>
<P1>(e) providing KPMG with physical access to Jamesway's premises and the documents of 172 relating to the JV Project; and</P1>
<P1>(f) setting up the KPMG Portal.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>354.</BOLD> Schembri has been engaged in a concerted effort over many years to frustrate 172's entitlement to determine the profit of the JV Project by:
<P1>(a) failing to provide documents relating to his acquisition, carrying and development of the JV Lands prior to the acquisition of the JV Lands by 172;</P1>
<P1>(b) failing to provide documents supporting the claims in the Schembri Claims Brief;</P1>
<P1>(c) refusing to approve any change orders whatsoever;</P1>
<P1>(d) refusing to identify which change orders he disputes, anddisclose the reason(s) for his dispute; and</P1>
<P1>(e) demanding provision of a &ldquo;full and final accurate accounting&rdquo; when he knows such an accounting cannot be provided given his failures and refusals listed in (a) to (d) above.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>355.</BOLD> Schembri has attempted to justify his conduct by alleging that the profit from the JV Project ought to be approximately $10,000,000 calculated as follows:

</P>
<P><BOLD>356.</BOLD> Schembri could not have anticipated that the profits arising from the JV Project would be approximately $10,000,000 given that:
<P1>(a) 345 King was sold to Maas for $28,750,000, including GST;</P1>
<P1>(b) there was a real estate commission on the sale to Maas in the amount of $750,000 (plus G.S.T. in the amount of $37,500, for a total of $787,500);</P1>
<P1>(c) the JV Pro Forma related to a building that was:
<P2>(i) never approved by the City;</P2>
<P2>(ii) never financed by any lender;</P2>
<P2>(iii) never constructed by 172; and</P2>
<P2>(iv) never sold to Maas, nor anyone else;</P2></P1>
<P1>(d) the JV Pro Forma did not contemplate and/or budget for a sale of the JV Pro Forma Building Design;</P1>
<P1>(e) the construction budget for the JV Approved Building Design was approximately $21,000,000, and Schembri agreed to that budget;</P1>
<P1>(f) our agreement on Pre-Development Costs;</P1>
<P1>(g) the Owner's Rep Agreement;</P1>
<P1>(h) the additional costs incurred (after commencement of the construction of the JV Approved Building Design) as a result of, among other things:
<P2>(i) Schembri's decision to reconfigure the ground floor and basement;</P2>
<P2>(ii) our decisions relating to:
<P3>(A) the security cameras;</P3>
<P3>(B) the security guards; and</P3>
<P3>(C) the man lift;</P3></P2>
<P2>(iii) the delays in completing the stucco work, including the delay occasioned by the Fall; and</P2>
<P2>(iv) various subsequent requirements demanded by the City;</P2></P1>
<P1>(i) the actual fees paid by 172 to obtain all necessary municipal approvals as compared to the projected fees in the JV Pro Forma (in part because the number of units increased from 82 to 94);</P1>
<P1>(j) the actual interest and fees paid in connection with financing the JV Project;</P1>
<P1>(k) the actual legal fees paid, including the amount paid to Volpini for his services in connection with the JV Project and its sale to Maas; and</P1>
<P1>(l) the loss of entitlement to claim the new property residential rental rebate resulting in our decision to sell 345 King to Maas.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>357.</BOLD> In addition to the foregoing, there remains an outstanding obligation to Canada Revenue Agency <BOLD>(&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;)</BOLD> in respect of G.S.T. on the sale of 345 King. Previously, I caused an application to be brought to have approximately $275,000 held in trust released to CRA. Schembri opposed this application, and then did not serve any responding materials. Ultimately, the application was granted, and the monies in trust were released to CRA. Subsequently, CRA served a Requirement to Pay on, among others, the Receiver of the Triumph Subsidiaries. Copies of the documents relating to the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;141&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>358.</BOLD> Further to paragraph 356 and 357 above, Schembri knows that the profit from the JV Project is nearer $6,000,000 if the JV Project was completed at or close to the agreed budget for the JV Approved Building Design given the real estate commission and certain additional soft costs (and leaving aside the additional construction costs) as shown below:

</P>
<P><BOLD>359.</BOLD> I have subsequently come to believe that Schembri was attempting to bankrupt me so he would not have to comply with the Contribution Clause and ROFR Clause. I come to believe this, in part, following a telephone call from Erich Mallet, of CIBC, wherein he inquired who Schembri was Schembri had contacted CIBC and bad-mouthed me.</P>
<P><BOLD>360.</BOLD> As Schembri was unsuccessful in bankrupting me, he has now brought the within motion after an inordinate delay that he has not explained in the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit.</P>
<P><BOLD>361.</BOLD> In any event, the JV Accounting cannot be finalized until after the examination for discovery of Schembri.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Rollover Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>362.</BOLD> Schembri has alleged that I was required to fund the Triumph Lands, at no interest, unless I obtained financing elsewhere supported, if necessary, by guarantees from me and my companies but not him or his companies. There is no such requirement in the Shareholder Agreement.</P>
<P><BOLD>363.</BOLD> In fact, Schembri's allegation in this regard was not asserted in the Statement of Claim, but rather the <UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim.</P>
<P><BOLD>364.</BOLD> It is absurd to suggest that I would bear the risk of funding the redevelopment of the Triumph Lands (estimated to cost approximately $74,000,000 in the aggregate) in exchange for a 55% interest in Triumph, while Schembri would have no risk (according to his alleged interpretation of paragraph 12 to the Shareholder Agreement) in exchange for a 45% interest in Triumph.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Schembri Loan Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>365.</BOLD> Regardless of whether the $1,400,000 was a short term loan (as it was) or an advance against 178's share of the profits from the JV Project (as Schembri alleges), the fact is that Schembri received, directly or indirectly, the benefit of $1,400,000.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The JV Repayment</TI>
<P><BOLD>366.</BOLD> Schembri knows that 172 did not have any funds of its own to purchase the five properties that he had tied up previously. This was addressed in the Deloitte Report.</P>
<P><BOLD>367.</BOLD> Schembri also knows that paragraph 2(12) of the JV Agreement permitted 172 to repay advances prior to any distribution. The advances repaid were addressed in the Deloitte Report.</P>
<P><BOLD>368.</BOLD> As Justice Turnbull stated in paragraph 27 of the Turnbull Decision, &ldquo;[i]t appears that only $280,000 is related to the Wayco [Beneficiaries]&rdquo;, collectively. Yet, Schembri has sued each of the Wayco Beneficiaries for $5,000,000.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Triumph Costs</TI>
<P><BOLD>369.</BOLD> As stated in above, the Receiver conducted the Claims Procedure. Both Schembri and I voluntarily participated in the Claims Procedure and caused substantial claims to be filed.</P>
<P><BOLD>370.</BOLD> The Receiver reviewed the claims filed, made certain determinations and reported on these activities to the Court. The Court approved the activities of the Receiver, without exception.</P>
<P><BOLD>371.</BOLD> The Receiver allowed various third party claims and paid them in full, on consent and with court approval.</P>
<P><BOLD>372.</BOLD> Subsequently, Schembri sought to amend the <UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Statement of Claim to allege fraud in respect of claims I caused to be filed with the Receiver for &ldquo;unauthorized and unapproved services&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BOLD>373.</BOLD> The alleged &ldquo;unauthorized and unapproved services&rdquo; are set out in paragraph 86A(a), (b) and (c). Only Premier provided services; whereas KFI and 172 provided funds. This was addressed in the Deloitte Report.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>49</N><TI>Revisiting the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion</TI>
<P><BOLD>374.</BOLD> I wish to address the evidence put forward by Schembri in the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit as it relates to the properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action.</P>
<P><BOLD>375.</BOLD> Contrary to paragraph 71 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, I never told Schembri that I had no interest in the acquisition or development of student housing in Waterloo region. The JV Project wasstudent housing. We planned to develop both the Oshawa Lands and London Lands as student housing.</P>
<P><BOLD>376.</BOLD> Regarding paragraph 73 of the Schembri ROFR SJ Affidavit, I acknowledge that I knew at the time we entered into the JV Agreement that Schembri had previously acquired and developed (or was in the process of developing) the following properties in Waterloo:
<P1>(a) 26 Columbia Street;</P1>
<P1>(b) 35 Columbia Street; and</P1>
<P1>(c) 347 Spruce Street;</P1>
as is evident from Schembri's net worth statement forming part of Exhibit &ldquo;14&rdquo;.</P>
<P><BOLD>377.</BOLD> Further, I came to know before we entered into the Shareholder Agreement that Schembri had acquired and developed (or was in the process of developing) 75 Columbia Street as Schembri, through Leaf, had contracted with Jamesway and Terra-Tec to perform work on this property.</P>
<P><BOLD>378.</BOLD> None of the properties in paragraphs 376 and 377 are the subject matter of the ROFR Action, so I do not know why Schembri has referred to them.</P>
<P><BOLD>379.</BOLD> I now turn to the properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><N>50</N><TI>The ROFR Action Properties</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>61 Columbia</TI>
<P><BOLD>380.</BOLD> After Schembri caused 1765998 Ontario Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;1765&rdquo;)</BOLD> to be incorporated on or about August 22, 2008,1765 purchased:
<P1>(a) 61 Columbia Street, Waterloo on or about December 17, 2008; and</P1>
<P1>(b) 59 Columbia Street, Waterloo on or about May 6, 2009.</P1></P>
<P>Copies of the documents evidencing the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;142&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>381.</BOLD> I recall attending at a property on Columbia at a corner. To the best of my recollection it was 61 Columbia. At that time, Schembri told me he wanted to construct a triplex with 15 bedrooms.</P>
<P><BOLD>382.</BOLD> At no time did he disclose that he had an interest in the adjoining property (which I believe is 59 Columbia), which he subsequently consolidated with 61 Columbia and developed into a larger building as described in the webpage from Schembri's website attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;143&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>41 Columbia</TI>
<P><BOLD>383.</BOLD> After Schembri caused 41 Columbia Inc. to be incorporated on or about August 22, 2008, 41 Columbia Inc. completed the purchases of 39 and 41 Columbia Street, Waterloo on or about April 30, 2010. Copies of the documents evidencing the foregoing are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;144&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>384.</BOLD> I believe Schembri developed 41 Columbia into student accommodation as described in the webpage from Schembri's website attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;145&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>1 Columbia</TI>
<P><BOLD>385.</BOLD> On or about July 22, 2011, Schembri caused King &amp; Columbia Inc. to be incorporated.</P>
<P><BOLD>386.</BOLD> King &amp; Columbia Inc. purchased the Waterloo Lands on or about August 2, 2011.</P>
<P><BOLD>387.</BOLD> Prior to King &amp; Columbia Inc. completing the purchase of the Waterloo Lands, the plaintiffs put Schembri Financial and Schembri on notice that the Shareholder Agreement obliged them to present KFI with this prospective development (the <BOLD>&ldquo;359 King Opportunity&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>388.</BOLD> Schembri Financial and Schembri ignored this notice and King &amp; Columbia Inc. proceeded to complete the purchase of the Waterloo Lands.</P>

thereby breaching the ROFR Clause repeatedly over several years.</P>
<P><BOLD>399.</BOLD> Schembri has not produced the agreements of purchase and sale for:
<P1>(a) 59 and 61 Columbia Street, Waterloo pursuant to which 1765 acquired these properties;</P1>
<P1>(b) 39 and 41 Columbia Street, Waterloo pursuant to which 41 Columbia Inc. acquired these properties;</P1>

<P2>(iv) 72, 76, 78 and 80 Balsam Street, Waterloo</P2>
pursuant to which The Block Inc. acquired these twelve (12) properties;</P1>
<P1>(e) the following four (4) properties:
<P2>(i) 73 and 77 Hickory Street West, Waterloo;</P2>
<P2>(ii) 265 Larch Street, Waterloo; and</P2>

<P2>(iii) 275 Larch Street, Waterloo;</P2>
pursuant to which The Block II Inc. acquired these three (3) properties.</P1></P>
<P>Accordingly, I do not know (nor does the Court know) when Schembri tied up any of these twenty-four (24) properties.</P>
<P><BOLD>400.</BOLD> Schembri has not produced any financial information relating to:
<P1>(a) the acquisition and development of:
<P2>(i) the 61 Columbia Opportunity;</P2>
<P2>(ii) the 41 Columbia Opportunity;</P2>
<P2>(iii) the 359 King Opportunity;</P2>
<P2>(iv) the 5 Rittenhouse Opportunity;</P2>
<P2>(v) The Block Opportunity; or</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) the sale of 5 Rittenhouse Road.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>401.</BOLD> In June, 2017, I was informed by Joe Benninger, a real estate agent in Kitchener-Waterloo, and believe that Schembri: (a) purchased a property at the corner of Bridgeport Road and Weber Street in Waterloo with the intent to build a high rise apartment building; and (b) owned another property in Kitchener on which he is constructing a medical building. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that Schembri has not produced any documents relating to the purchases of these properties.</P>
<P><BOLD>402.</BOLD> Accordingly, I do not know (nor does the Court have an appreciation of) the quantum of damages resulting from Schembri's repeated breaches of the ROFR Clause over several years. Having regard to the JV Project, I believe the damages resulting from Schembri's repeated breaches of the ROFR Clause over several years are in the tens of millions of dollars.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The within action (the &ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo; or &ldquo;This Action&rdquo;) is a companion action to Court File No. C-42-11 (the &ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. The Actions have been highly litigious as is evidenced by This Honourable Court, the Toronto Commercial Court and the Court of Appeal rendering over 43 Orders.</P>
<P>3. Way and his Companies have defrauded Schembri and breached their contractual and fiduciary duties owed to them. This has been found by the Courts and confirmed by the evidence of independent third parties.</P>
<P>4. In response to the Main Action, Triumph Financial, Kingsley Financial and Way commenced this Action seeking to enforce a Non-Competition Clause included in a Shareholder's Agreement entered into as between Schembri and Way (and/or corporate entities that they control) that required Schembri to present all real estate opportunities acquired in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo to Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial. They seek $30,000,000.00 in damages arising from Schembri's alleged breaches of the said Clause. Way personally has no valid claim since he personally is not the beneficiary of the Non-Competition Clause, only Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial are.</P>
<P>5. Schembri acquired property in Waterloo without inviting Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial to participate because Way had defrauded him and he knew that he could never work or partner with Way again.</P>
<P>6. The Non-Competition Clause is not enforceable as it is (1) merely an agreement to agree, (2) ambiguous, (3) unreasonable, (4) practically unworkable, and (5) unnecessary to protect Way's legitimate business interests. Since the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable this Action must be dismissed.</P>
<P>7. The Non-Competition Clause was intended only to apply to three specific development projects in London, Waterloo and Oshawa that were located and tied up by the parties prior to Schembri discovering Way's frauds. As a result of Way's fraudulent conduct the three aforementioned properties were eventually sold by a Receiver pursuant to a Court Ordered process in the Main Action.</P>
<P>8. Way's position is that although he cannot explain how it would work, the Non- Competition Clause is enforceable and applicable to any and all real estate development opportunities in Waterloo Region in perpetuity. Way's evidence is that the Clause will, even after the parties' death, continue to bind his and Schembri's children and grandchildren, and so on into perpetuity.</P>
<P>9. The problem is that a careful reading of the Non-Competition Clause results in unanswerable questions, but no answers. Way himself, through cross-examinations, could not explain or provide any insight as to how the future relationships as between the parties would look or operate, including with respect to who would participate, fund, finance or guarantee any future developments.</P>
<P>10. Way points to an Arbitration Clause in the Shareholder Agreement and suggests that it would be up to an arbitrator to decide or craft the terms and structure of future development agreements. Of course, that is not the arbitrator's function. It is commercially unreasonable and completely outside of the scope of the jurisdiction and function of an arbitrator or a Judge to do so.</P>
<P>11. It was the parties' intention that the Non-Competition clause would apply to the Waterloo, London and Oshawa properties that were known to the parties and approved as developments at the time that the Shareholder Agreement was entered into. Any further development opportunity would be the subject of further negotiation and necessitate the agreement as between the parties on all essential terms. This is evidenced by the inherent vagueness of the Non-Competition Clause that lacks the material terms necessary to structure any further legal relationship between the parties.</P>
<P>12. Despite Way's continued successes as a developer, Way is attempting, through the ROFR Action, to &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; upon Schembri's successes through an interpretation of the Non- Competition Clause in a manner that is not commercial reasonable and that fails to take into account the simple fact that it would be impossible for Way and Schembri to work together given the history between the parties and the serious frauds committed by Way.</P>
<P>13. In essence, Way is asking that the Court enforce a contractual relationship between the parties that has no temporal limits, that is vaguely and insufficiently outlined, that does not contain the necessary material terms, and that will undoubtedly result in continuous and sustained litigation as between the parties.</P>
<P>14. Based upon the record before This Honourable Court, it would be just, expedient and in the interests of justice to dismiss the ROFR Action summarily.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>15. Between 2005 and 2007, Schembri assembled various parcels of land in the City of Waterloo (the &ldquo;345 King Street Lands&rdquo;) to redevelop same.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Gordon Schembri sworn May 17, 2017 (the &ldquo;Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017&rdquo;), in the Defendants/Moving Party's Motion Record (&ldquo;DMR&rdquo;), Tab 2, at paras. 6 and 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. Schembri contacted Way as a contractor. This resulted in Way and Schembri entering into a Joint Venture Agreement (the &ldquo;JVA&rdquo;) with respect to the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands. Pursuant to the JVA, it was understood and agreed that Way would be required to fund, finance, and guarantee the development and, through Jamesway, construct the superstructure and be responsible for general conditions.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 8; Affidavit of Gord Schembri sworn May 14, 2010, at paras. 11&ndash;13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The JVA provided, <EM>inter alia</EM>, as follows:
<P1>(a) Schembri would receive a return of his equity contribution associated with acquiring the 345 King Street Lands, following which Way and Schembri, or their designated entities, would each receive 50% of the profit from the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands;</P1>
<P1>(b) Way and his entities would be responsible for obtaining financing, guarantees, all equity required, and any and all financing contributions required until the completion of the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands;</P1>
<P1>(c) Construction contracts would be awarded by both Way or his designated entities through an &ldquo;<EM>open book concept</EM>&rdquo;, except for work performed by Jamesway Construction, which was to be a fixed price contract reflected in the agreed upon budget as appended to the JVA;</P1>
<P1>(d) No increase in the agreed upon budget could be made without the unanimous written agreement of both Schembri and Way.
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2 at para. 9. Affidavit of Al Way sworn March 16, 2018 (&ldquo;Way Affidavit sworn March 16, 2018&rdquo;), Plaintiffs/Responding Parties' Motion Record (&ldquo;PMR&rdquo;), Tab A, at para 59, Exhibit 16.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>18. At no time did the parties to the JVA agree that Way's corporations (aside from Jamesway) would perform any work with respect to the 345 King Street Lands. Article 2(9) (c) of the JVA clearly set out that all construction contracts were to be awarded through an &ldquo;<EM>open book concept</EM>&rdquo;. Article 2(9) (c) of the JVA states:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Construction Contracts shall be agreed and awarded by both Joint Venturers through an open book concept save and except for any work performed by Jamesway. Any increase to Jamesway's contract shall be agreed to by both parties</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Gordon Schembri sworn May 14, 2010, at paras 16&ndash;20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Pursuant to the JVA, and the agreed upon budget, the profit anticipated from the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands, was to be $10,000,000.00. Schembri anticipated earning a profit of approximately $5,000,000.00 from the 345 King Street Lands redevelopment in accordance with the JVA.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 12.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. Prior to completion of the joint venture, and while they were on good terms, Schembri and Way also entered into a Shareholders Agreement for Triumph Financial Holdings Inc. (&ldquo;Triumph Financial&rdquo;), which provided, <EM>inter alia</EM>, as follows:
<P1>(a) The Plaintiff, Kingsley Financial Inc. (&ldquo;Kingsley Financial&rdquo;), would own 55% of the shares of Triumph Financial and Schembri Financial Limited (&ldquo;Schembri Financial&rdquo;) would own the remaining 45%. Kingsley Financial received a larger percentage of shares to reflect its agreement to finance and guarantee development;</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri and Way were appointed as Directors of Triumph Financial and Way was President and Schembri was Secretary and Treasurer;</P1>
<P1>(c) Way, as President, had the ability to sign all contracts on behalf of Triumph Financial, except in respect of matters relating to land acquisition, mortgage financing, construction budgets and project feasibility, which required the signatures of both Way and Schembri;</P1>
<P1>(d) Each of the Directors had one vote and Way, as Chairman, did not have any additional or casting vote. Accordingly, if Way and Schembri did not agree, then the Board of Directors would be deadlocked;</P1>
<P1>(e) Unanimous shareholder approval was required for Triumph Financial:
<P2>a) To directly or indirectly make any loans or advances, or invest in or give security for, or guarantee the debts of any other corporation or person;</P2>
<P2>b) To enter into any partnership or arrangement for the sharing of profits or joint venture with any person, firm, or a corporation, except in the normal course of business;</P2>
<P2>c) To mortgage or encumber any of its assets;</P2>
<P2>d) To commit to any financing arrangements with any third parties;</P2>
<P2>e) To undertake any project without initiating project feasibility studies and construction budget approvals.</P2></P1>
<P1>(f) The invalidity of any provision of the Shareholders Agreement or any covenant contained therein would not affect the validity of any other provision or covenant therein. The parties therefor recognized that certain terms might be invalid;</P1>
<P1>(g) Way agreed to provide or acquire all financing, equity and guarantees for any projects undertaken by Triumph Financial;</P1>
<P1>(h) The Shareholder Agreement could not be amended except in writing.</P1></P>
<P>21. This Action concerns a Right of First Refusal, or Non-Competition Clause, at Article 13, in the Shareholders Agreement which states:
<QUOTE><P><EM>During the period which SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL is a shareholder of the Corporation [Triumph Financial], it shall have the ongoing obligation to present to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation</EM> <UNDER><EM>all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired</EM></UNDER> <EM>within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This obligation to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation</EM> <UNDER><EM>shall also extend to GORDON SCHEMBRI personally and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise</EM></UNDER>. <EM>KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically</EM> <UNDER><EM>feasible using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances</EM></UNDER> <EM>and, if at the expiry of the FIFTEEN (15) day period neither of them have indicated to SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL in writing that it is taking on the Project, then SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL (or its designate) shall be free to pursue the Project without the involvement of KINGSLEY FINANCIAL or the Corporation</EM>. [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>(the &ldquo;Non-Competition Clause&rdquo;)</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at paras. 14&ndash;17; Affidavit of A. Way Sworn March 16, 2018, PMR, Tab A, at para 145, Exhibit 54.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>ACQUISITION OF PSHAW A/WATERLOO/LONDON PROPERTIES</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. In anticipation of entering into the Shareholders Agreement, and based upon the said agreement, Schembri assembled and acquired three additional properties, in Oshawa (the &ldquo;Oshawa Property&rdquo;), Waterloo (the &ldquo;Waterloo Property&rdquo;), and London (the &ldquo;London Property&rdquo;).
<P1><EM>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR Tab 2, at para. 16.</EM></P1></P>
<P>23. Triumph Financial was incorporated, the Shareholder Agreement was signed, and three subsidiary corporations of Triumph Financial were incorporated to take title to the said three properties as per the agreement between Way and Schembri. Accordingly, it was agreed that the Shareholder Agreement would govern the development of those three properties.</P>
<P>24. Schembri is adamant that when the Shareholder Agreement was negotiated in January of 2008, it was the parties' intention that the said agreement would only be in effect for the redevelopment of the Oshawa, Waterloo, and London Properties. This intention was clearly set out by Mr. Volpini, being counsel for Way, at the Shareholder Meeting held in January of 2008 who confirmed that the Shareholder Agreement bound the parties to the three aforementioned properties and that any further development of the properties would require their agreement (&ldquo;Shareholder Meeting&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of G. Schembri dated April 2, 2018 at p. 1759, q. 6819.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. When cross-examined, Way could not recall and had no memory of, <EM>inter alia</EM>, Mr. Volpini stating:
<P1>(a) That the Shareholder Agreement was intended to cover only the Oshawa, Waterloo, and London Properties;</P1>
<P1>(b) That the intent of the deal was that if Schembri and Way wanted to do other projects together they would have to negotiate the terms;</P1>
<P1>(c) that &ldquo;future deals, it could be 55/45 percent or 50/50. Whatever you negotiate&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(d) that &ldquo;<EM>this arrangement won't be like a marriage between you. You'll both have to agree if you want to go forward on future deals, This arrangement is just for the three deals that are on the table</EM>&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018, at pp. 160&ndash;163, qq. 640&ndash;645</BOLD>.</P2></P1></P>
<P>26. When Way was asked to undertake to ask Mr. Volpini if he made such statements, the questions were taken under advisement/refused. No answers have been produced.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018, at pp.160&ndash;163, qq. 640&ndash;645.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO 345 KING STREET LANDS</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. Way and Schembri developed the 345 King Street Lands. In June of 2008, the 345 King Street Lands were sold to a third-party purchaser for $28,750,000.00. The sale closed on March 19, 2009.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of G. Schembri sworn April 6, 2010 at paras 34&ndash;39.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. At no time during the redevelopment of the 345 King Street Lands was Schembri advised, nor did he agree, that the cost of construction would be greater than the amount stipulated in the JVA. Schembri expected his profits to be approximately $5,000,000.00.

<P>29. Despite what was anticipated from the budgets, Schembri or his corporate entities only received $1,400,000.00 from the profits generated. There was a shortfall of at least $3,600,000.00.

<P>30. Schembri demanded an accounting from Way. The accounting provided by Way was incomplete and fraudulent. Way fraudulently used his other corporations to do work at inflated costs without Schembri's consent. As a result, Schembri commenced the Main Action seeking, damages for fraud as against Way and his corporations, and the appointment of a Receiver with respect to the Oshawa, London and Waterloo Properties.

<P>31. Way and his companies have defrauded Schembri and breached the fiduciary duties owed including diverting $6,000,000.00 of Joint Venture profits to his own corporation.

<P>34. Way made it abundantly clear during his cross-examinations pending the Receivership Motion that, with respect to the Waterloo, Oshawa and London Properties, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) <EM>&ldquo;No other contractor's gonna work on these projects if I'm involved in them</EM>;</P1>

<P>35. Justice Roberts dismissed the relief sought by Way and granted the relief sought by Schembri and appointed a Receiver over all of Triumph Financial's assets.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn April 5, 2018, RMR, Tab A, at para. 72; Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018 at p. 116, q.459.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. In this regard, Justice Roberts made significant findings with respect to the conduct of Way:
<P1>(a) Having reviewed the extensive evidence submitted by the parties, including the transcripts from the numerous cross-examinations, I agree that, pursuant to Section 101(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, &ldquo;<EM>it would be just and convenient to appoint a Receiver and Manager to undertake the completion of the three real estate projects</EM>&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>The</EM> <BOLD><EM>Plaintiffs have presented a strong prima facie case against Mr. Way and his companies of serious financial and accounting irregularities and improprieties. Indeed, the Defendants have not disputed the evidence provided by the Plaintiffs</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>In particular, the uncontested evidence of</EM> <BOLD><EM>Regean Depuis</EM></BOLD>, <EM>who had formally been employed by James Way Construction Corporation as the construction manager for the initial Waterloo Project, concerning the Defendants handling of that project</EM>, <BOLD><EM>establishes a strong prima facie case that Mr. Way grossly inflated the amounts of various change orders that were charged against the profits of the initial Waterloo project to the benefit of the Defendants and to the detriment of the Plaintiffs. It is significant that, in the first Waterloo project, the vast majority of the work was carried out by Mr. Way's companies which did not tender for the work and over whose expenses and charges there was no independent control</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(d) <BOLD>&ldquo;<EM>Mr. Way added to change orders hundreds of hours for labour that were not expended on the Waterloo project and for the site supervision, scaffolding, heating and other amounts that seemed to have already been included in the fixed price contracts with Mr. Way's companies, and that Mr. Way grossed up each change order with unauthorized and excessive administrative fees. Mr. Depuis' unchallenged evidence was that Mr. Way told him to back charge all of the increased numbers as well as any costs due to overruns and mistakes to Mr. Schembri. Mr. Way admitted on his cross-examination that Mr. Schembri was not shown and therefore did not approve all of the written change orders, contrary to the provisions of their Joint Venture Agreement</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(e) &ldquo;<EM>Further, notwithstanding the requests of the Plaintiffs and their counsel and a court order for production</EM>, <BOLD><EM>the Defendants have not provided a full and proper accounting to the Plaintiffs</EM></BOLD> <EM>of the initial Waterloo project. As noted below, the Defendants are still resisting the Plaintiff's request for production of relevant financial and documentation and information.&rdquo;</EM></P1>
<P1>(f) &ldquo;<EM>I agree with the Plaintiffs' submission</EM> <BOLD><EM>that the Plaintiffs cannot have confidence in the accounting performed or disclosed by the Defendants</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>None of the financial statements pertaining to the joint venture is audited and their contents are based on the questionable numbers provided by Mr. Way to his accountants</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(g) <BOLD>&ldquo;<EM>Mr. Way's evidence</EM></BOLD> <EM>on cross-examination in response to questions concerning relevant financial information</EM> <BOLD><EM>was often incorrect and unhelpful</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(h) &ldquo;<EM>As a particular example, when questioned about the</EM> <BOLD><EM>improper transfer of $6 million dollars of joint venture funds</EM></BOLD> <EM>to Premier Project Consultants (a Way corporation) and subsidiary corporations, Mr. Way testified that it was the &ldquo;accountants&rdquo; who devised this paper trail; however Mr. Lund (the accountant) testified that he did not advise Mr. Way to transfer the funds in that fashion which had no accounting purpose, but only learned about it after it had been done.&rdquo;</EM></P1>
<P1>(i) <BOLD>&ldquo;<EM>The evidence that had been produced by Mr. Lund revealed that Mr. Way had apparently improperly transferred funds from the joint venture to pay unrelated payroll expenses and supplies of his other companies, including companies not involved in these projects, over which he has exclusive control</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(j) &ldquo;<EM>I have no hesitation in concluding that</EM> <BOLD><EM>the appointment of a Receiver and manager is a remedy necessary to right the wrongs apparently perpetrated by the Defendants</EM>.</BOLD>&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(k) &ldquo;<EM>The uncontested evidence establishing a</EM> <BOLD><EM>strong prima facie case that Mr. Way has an ability that he has already exercised to shuffle money around to numerous corporations over which he has exclusive control</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>Further, Mr. Way</EM> <BOLD><EM>has not been fully compliant with court order production of relevant financial information</EM></BOLD> <EM>and documentation to the Plaintiffs, and he seems to be willing to manipulate figures and disregard his accountant's advice</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(1) &ldquo;<EM>As strongly made out by the Plaintiffs unchallenged evidence, in particular, that of Mr. Depuis and Mr. Lund and the financial documentation produced, it appears that</EM> <BOLD><EM>Mr. Way's intent on improperly excluding the Plaintiffs and maximizing profits for himself and his companies to the Plaintiffs' detriment</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(m) &ldquo;<EM>Based on the uncontested evidence before me and for the reasons already given</EM>, <BOLD><EM>unless a Receiver and manager has the ultimate authority with respect to the monitoring and management of the remaining real estate projects, it is very unlikely that the Defendants will cooperate. Further, none of the remaining projects is &ldquo;shuffle ready&rdquo;; and design and other disputes between the parties mean that the projects are all at a standstill</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>As a result, this is a convenient juncture for the introduction of a Receiver and manager</EM>.&rdquo; [Emphasis added]
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 35.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>37. Way's affidavit filed in support of the within Motion does not respect or accept the findings of Justice Roberts at the Receivership Motion (despite the fact that he did not appeal Her Honour's decision).</P>
<P>38. In this regard, Way deposes that he did not &ldquo;<EM>grossly inflate the amounts of various change orders</EM>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<EM>there was no improper transfer of $6 million dollars of joint venture funds</EM>&rdquo;. Way's evidence is, however, contradicted by:
<P1>(a) Justice Roberts' findings;</P1>
<P1>(b) the evidence of Regean Dupuis, an independent witness and Way's Project Manager, who swore his oath to the fact, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that Jamesway did in fact fraudulently inflate the amounts of various change orders with respect to 345 King Street lands;

<P1>(c) the evidence of Way's accountant, Brad Lund, who, during his examination as a witness to the Receivership Motion, and by way of answers to undertakings:
<P2>a) outlined how the $6,000,000.00 in Joint Venture funds was deposited into an account operated by one of Way's companies, Premier Project Consultants; and</P2>
<P2>b) provided evidence as to how:
<P3>(1) $15,000.00 of the joint venture funds were utilized by Premier Project Consultants to pay its payroll; and</P3>
<P3>(2) Over $800,000.00 was diverted by Premier Project Consultants to 5 or 6 of way's corporations that had nothing to do with the Development and was used to pay invoices and payroll.</P3></P2>

<P>39. The Court of Appeal adopted the reasoning of Justice Roberts with respect to Way's conduct which he continues to deny:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Based on the undisputed evidence</EM>, <BOLD><EM>Roberts J. made a number of significant findings of wrongdoing by Mr. Way and the companies he controlled. For instance, she found that Mr. Way had shuffled money around to his corporations, that he had not complied fully with Court ordered production and he was willing to manipulate figures and to ignore his accountant's advice</EM>.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 65.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. The Honourable Justice Sloan (&ldquo;Justice Sloan&rdquo;) has also made findings regarding Way's conduct including, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that Way:
<P1>(a) failed to comply with Court ordered timetables on various occasions;</P1>
<P1>(b) repeatedly failed to comply with Orders of the Court;</P1>
<P1>(c) failed to comply with undertakings given to the Court;</P1>
<P1>(d) repeatedly failed to comply with the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>; and</P1>
<P1>(e) has not explained or apologized for his conduct to the Court.
<P2><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice Sloan dated December 23, 2016 at para 52.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>41. The cost submissions of Way filed in support of the costs arising from Justice Sloan's December 23, 2016 decision, again evidence that Way does not accept or respect the findings of Justice Sloan but rather continues to dispute them, rather than appeal them.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn April 5, 2018, RMR, Tab A, at paras. 94&ndash;99.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE WITHIN ACTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. Way commenced the within action by way of Statement of Claim on May 25, 2012, seeking, <EM>inter alia</EM>, damages for breach of the Non-Competition Clause.</P>
<P>43. Despite the clear findings of the Court (as set out above), Way insists that Schembri and his companies should continue to work with him with respect to any and all real estate developments in the Region of Waterloo on an indeterminate and undefined basis as per the Shareholder Agreement. This would be an unmitigated disaster.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at paras. 35, 54, and 56.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. The Non-Competition Clause is contrary to public policy, ambiguous, unreasonable, unnecessary to protect any of the parties' legitimate interests and, therefore, unenforceable. In any event, given Way's fraudulent conduct, he has materially breached the Shareholder Agreement and cannot rely upon the Non-competition Clause. Accordingly, the within action ought to be summarily dismissed based upon the Record before this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>45. It is important to note at the outset that the Non-Competition Clause is in favour of only Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial and not Way personally. Of course Triumph Financial includes both Schembri and Way and is deadlocked, defunct, not carrying on business, and its only assets are with a Receiver. Kingsley Financial has never been in the development business. It is merely used by Way as a conduit for the transfer of funds between his companies.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>SUMMARY JUDGMENT PRINCIPLES</UNDER></TI>
<P>46. There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when a Judge hearing a summary judgment motion is able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits, and that this will be the case where the process (1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result.

<P>47. <EM>Hryniak</EM> provided a roadmap to be followed by Judges hearing motions for summary judgment. The Judge should first determine if there is a genuine issue requiring trial based only on the evidence before her, without using the new fact-finding powers in sub rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2). There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial if the summary judgment process provides the motions Judge with the evidence required to fairly and justly adjudicate the dispute and is a timely, affordable and proportionate procedure. If there appears to be a genuine issue requiring a trial, the Judge should then determine if the need for a trial can be avoided by using the new powers under sub rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2). While summary judgment must be granted if there is no genuine issue requiring a trial, the decision to use either the expanded fact-finding powers or to call oral evidence is discretionary.

<P>48. The only motion before This Honourable Court is Schembri's motion seeking, <EM>inter alia</EM>, a declaration that the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable and of no force and effect, and granting summary judgment as a result thereof.</P>
<P>49. Way has attempted to hijack the within Motion by stating in Way's affidavit that he is seeking relief that (1) was not contemplated by the parties or addressed before the Honourable Mr. Justice Sloan at the time that the within motion was scheduled, (2) is not the subject matter of any motion, and (3) is not properly before the Court. This behaviour by Way is not new to the proceedings. He tried to do this before and hijack the Sales Process and Schembri's motion to compel answers to undertakings. The Court of Appeal and Justice Sloan refused to permit him to do that and ordered significant costs against him. This should be no different.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn April 5, 2018, RMR, Tab A, at paras 38&ndash;68, 111.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. The discreet issue that is to be determined on this Motion is whether the Non-Competition Clause is enforceable, and, if not, should the Court grant Summary Judgment?</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</TI>
<P>51. The Non-Competition Clause is a restrictive covenant. Restrictive covenants give rise to a tension in the common law between the concept of freedom to contract and public policy considerations against the restraint of trade. At common law, restraints of trade are contrary to public policy because they interfere with individual liberty of action and because the exercise of trade should be encouraged and should be free.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Shafron v. ERG Insurance Brokers (Western) Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2009] 1 SCR 157</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Shafron</EM>&rdquo;) at para 16, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>52. There is strong public interest in &ldquo;<EM>discouraging restraints on trade and, maintaining free and open competition unencumbered by the fetters of restricted covenants</EM>&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Martin v. Con Create USL Limited Partnership</SOC><CITE>[2013] OJ No 515</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Martin</EM>&rdquo;) at para 53, DBA at Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>53. The Courts have, however, recognized that there must be exceptions to restraints against trade to allow parties the freedom to contract with each other. Accordingly, the exception to the general rule against trade is where the restraint of trade is found to be reasonable. Despite the presumption that restrictive covenants are <EM>prima facie</EM> unenforceable, a reasonable restrictive covenant will be upheld.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 17, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. The party that seeks to enforce a restrictive covenant has the onus of demonstrating that the covenants are reasonable as between the parties. The party seeking to avoid enforcement of the covenant bears the onus of demonstrating that it is not reasonable with respect to the public interest.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Martin</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 50, DBA at Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. In a commercial context, flexibility and latitude is required in interpreting restrictive covenants in order to protect freedom of trade and promote the stability of commercial agreements. Restrictive covenants in the commercial context are considered lawful, unless it can be established on a balance of probabilities that its scope is unreasonable
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Payette v. Guay Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2013] SCC 45</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[&ldquo;<EM>Payette</EM>&rdquo;) at para 58, DBA at Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>FIRST STEP/ ANALYSIS</TI>
<P>56. Before the Court can perform an analysis of the reasonableness of a restrictive covenant, it must first be determined that the covenant is unambiguous as &ldquo;<EM>the reasonableness of a covenant cannot be determined without first establishing the meaning of the covenant</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 27, DBA at Tab 2;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Mason v Chem-Trend Limited Partnership</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 344</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[&ldquo;<EM>Mason</EM>&rdquo;) at para 14, DBA at Tab 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. An ambiguous restrictive covenant will be <EM>prima facie</EM> unenforceable because the party seeking enforcement will be unable to demonstrate reasonableness in the face of an ambiguity. The Non-Competition Clause is ambiguous on its plain reading, as it does not set out the materials terms required. It is an agreement to agree and as such is unenforceable on that basis alone.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 27, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IS AMBIGUOUS</UNDER></TI>
<P>58. The Non-Competition Clause is ambiguous with respect to the obligations it purports to impose on Schembri.</P>
<P>59. The Non-Competition Clause provides, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that:
<QUOTE><P><EM>During the period which SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL is a shareholder of the Corporation [Triumph Financial], it shall have the ongoing obligation</EM> <UNDER><EM>to present to</EM></UNDER> <EM>KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation</EM> <BOLD><UNDER><EM>all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired</EM></UNDER></BOLD> <EM>within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This obligation to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall also extend to GORDON SCHEMBRI personally and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise. KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible</EM> <BOLD><UNDER><EM>using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances</EM></UNDER></BOLD> <EM>and, if at the expiry of the FIFTEEN (15) day period neither of them have indicated to SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL in writing that it is taking on the Project, then SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL (or its designate) shall be free to pursue the Project without the involvement of KINGSLEY FINANCIAL or the Corporation</EM>. [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Regional Municipality of Waterloo&rdquo;</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. The Non-Competition Clause purportedly applies to the all real estate development within the &ldquo;<EM>Regional Municipality of Waterloo</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>61. Pursuant to the <EM>Regional Municipality of Waterloo Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. R17, the <EM>Regional Municipality of Waterloo</EM> refers to the Regional Corporation. The terms has no relation to any definitive or finite spatial area.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Regional Municipality of Waterloo Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. R17, Section 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. In <EM>Shafron</EM>, the Supreme Court of British Columbia found, as it relates to a restrictive covenant, that there was no legal or judicial definition of the term &ldquo;Metropolitan City of Vancouver&rdquo; and accordingly found that the language was neither clear nor certain and dismissed the claim.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 44, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. The British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned the Trial Judge's decision, and found that while the meaning of the &ldquo;Metropolitan City of Vancouver&rdquo; was ambiguous, there was no doubt that the parties intended (and that it was likely in the reasonable contemplation of the parties) to prevent competition in the &ldquo;City of Vancouver and an area beyond the City&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 45-46, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. The Supreme Court of Canada overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal and found that:
<P1>(a) The Court should not attempt to resolve ambiguity in the term &ldquo;Metropolitan City of Vancouver&rdquo; by reading down the covenant according to the Court's notion of reasonableness and what it thought the parties might have intended;</P1>
<P1>(b) Severance was not applicable to remove the word &ldquo;Metropolitan&rdquo; as there was no evidence that the parties would have unquestionably agreed to remove the term without varying other terms of the contract or varying the bargain; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Rectification could not apply as in order to get rectification it is necessary to show that the parties were in complete agreement on the term, but by error, wrote down the agreement wrongly.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 47&ndash;55, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>65. There is no evidence before this Court that the parties had turned their minds to this facet of the agreement and that the parties would have unquestionably agreed as to what was included in the &ldquo;Regional Municipality of Waterloo&rdquo; as included in the Non-Competition Clause. This was not addressed in the affidavits or through cross-examinations. In fact, Schembri was never questioned about his at all.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 50, 55, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. The term &ldquo;Regional Municipality of Waterloo&rdquo; is ambiguous and its application unclear in the circumstances. The Non-Completion Clause ought to be found to be unenforceable on that ground alone.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Presentation of Real Estate Development Opportunities Acquired</UNDER></TI>
<P>67. The Non-Competition Clause sets out that Schembri is to &ldquo;<EM>present</EM>&rdquo; to Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial &ldquo;<EM>all real estate development opportunities</EM>&rdquo;, which it may have &ldquo;<EM>acquired</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>68. From the examinations of Way, it is clear that he does not understand and/or cannot explain the plain meaning of what the clause purports to govern. Schembri acknowledges in his affidavit that he also cannot understand the clause except to say that he and Way would have to mutually agree to any future deals on terms to be negotiated. He was never challenged on this in cross-examination.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1864, q. 1842; Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at paras. 84&ndash;89.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>69. In this regard, Way could not answer when the obligation to <EM>present</EM> arose or when an <EM>opportunity</EM> would be deemed to have been <EM>acquired</EM> in accordance with the Non-Competition Clause. Whether it is when an APS is signed, or when it is conditional or unconditional or closed is uncertain.</P>
<P>70. What is clear is that Way is uncertain as to when Schembri would be deemed to have &ldquo;<EM>acquired</EM>&rdquo; a real estate opportunity and when the obligation to &ldquo;<EM>present</EM>&rdquo; that real estate opportunity would arise.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, pp. 1864&ndash;1875, qq. 1844&ndash;1902.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>71. Ultimately, when asked his understanding of Schembri's obligation under the Non-Competition Clause to &ldquo;<EM>present</EM>&rdquo; to him, Way admitted that: &ldquo;<EM>It's not definitive</EM>&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1875, q. 1902.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>72. The Non-Competition Clause is also ambiguous as to what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;<EM>all real estate development opportunities</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>73. Way's position is that the Non-Competition Clause applies to <EM>all</EM> real estate development opportunities of Schembri and any other legal entity in which he has an interest directly or indirectly (whether such an opportunity constituted a legitimate business interest of Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial), which he says would include, <EM>inter alia</EM>::

<P2><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 18, 2018, at pp.206&ndash;210, qq. 773&ndash;787; Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1855, q. 1785, pp. 1872-1873, qq. 1888&ndash;1893.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>74. The scope of the proposed restriction which includes &ldquo;all real estate opportunities&rdquo; is ambiguous, commercially absurd, not necessary to protect Triumph Financial or Kingsley Financial's legitimate interests and cannot be enforced.</P>
<P>75. Additionally, it would be impossible for Schembri to know if a publically traded REIT or any other public company in which he purchased shares in would participate in development in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo or whether Article 13 would apply.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Typical Budget Model</UNDER></TI>
<P>76. The Non-Competition Clause is also ambiguous with respect to the manner by which it is contemplated that Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial will determine the economic feasibility of a real estate opportunity presented by Schembri. In this regard, the Non-Competition Clause states, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<QUOTE><P><EM>KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible</EM> <UNDER><EM>using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances</EM>.</UNDER></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>77. The problem here is that there was no &ldquo;typical budget&rdquo; in existence. Nowhere in the Shareholder Agreement is there any obligation upon anyone to prepare or present a typical budget model. In fact, Schembri has sworn his oath to the fact that no such &ldquo;typical budge model&rdquo; exists. How can the parties be compelled to use a budget model that does not exist? How can the parties proceed with a development in the absence of approved let alone typical budget? They cannot do so unless they reach an agreement to do so.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IS UNWORKABLE</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Agreement is void of Necessary Terms and Details</UNDER></TI>
<P>78. Any contract must contain the essential material terms or it is merely an agreement to agree. Courts cannot write in or create missing material contractual terms. It is clear that the Non-Competition Clause is at best an agreement to agree on the terms of any future developments.</P>
<P>79. In addition to the fact that the obligations imposed by the Non-Competition Clause are ambiguous (for the reasons as set out above), Schembri submits that the said Clause is also practically unworkable and hence unenforceable by a Court. This is because the Clause does not address a myriad of material terms that are essential for a binding contract.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Mason</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 19, DBA at Tab 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>80. In this regard, the Clause does not speak to and Way admitted on cross-examinations that, absent an agreement between Schembri and Triumph Financial/Kingsley Financial, he did not know and/or could not articulate how the Clause would practically work. The Clause does not address what would happen, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) If both Kingsley Financial and Triumph Financial determined that the real estate opportunities presented by Schembri were economically feasible, or the type of ownership interests the various parties would have, or the roles they would play (including the role of any new entities that would have to be incorporated and take title to the development opportunity)?</P1>
<P1>(b) If Triumph Financial wanted to pursue a project and Kingsley Financial did not?</P1>
<P1>(c) If the parties could not agree on a budget (there is no typical budget model) or if Kingsley Financial's budget was different from Triumph Financial's budget and they both wanted to proceed?</P1>
<P1>(d) Regarding the structure of the new companies that would have to be incorporated, the nature of the by-laws or articles of incorporation, or who would be officers, directors and shareholders?</P1>
<P1>(e) Regarding the method of funding for any project or who would provide and/or guarantee the financing?</P1>
<P1>(f) Regarding the source and infusion of the required equity into the real estate developments?</P1>
<P1>(g) Regarding what would happen if the parties could not agree on compensation for initial equity (sweat, money or recognition of creating value through a land assembly) that was put in to acquire the lands?</P1>
<P1>(h) Whether decisions regarding re-zoning would be the subject matter of negotiation?</P1>
<P1>(i) What would happen if Schembri asked for a fee (for example $5 million dollars) for presenting the real estate opportunity as the agreement does not prevent that?</P1>
<P1>(j) Who was to prepare the &ldquo;<EM>typical budget model</EM>&rdquo; referenced at paragraph 13 of the Non-Competition Clause?
<P2><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, pp. 1881&ndash;1895, qq. 1937&ndash;2010; Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2015, pp. 137&ndash;140, qq. 559&ndash;569; Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 18, 2018 at p.228&ndash;231, qq. 852&ndash;860.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>81. Since the Clause does not address these fundamental terms and Way could not provide insight it is crystal clear and commercially reasonable to interpret the Clause as requiring Schembri to present opportunities to Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial and then and only if all parties agree on all terms of a new opportunity, they would proceed. Absent agreement they could not proceed and an arbitrator or Judge would not and could not impose a deal upon them, structured and drafted by way of Judicial Order.</P>
<P>82. In an attempt to answer these ambiguities and lack of details, Way relies solely upon the arbitration clause contained at paragraph 15 of the Shareholder Agreement:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Q. Well if I understand your position, in the absence of an agreement an arbitrator would decide all aspects of the development that you and Mr. Schembri couldn't agree upon?</EM></P>
<P><EM>A.I believe that would be the purpose of the arbitrator</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 18, 2018 at p.232, q. 863.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>83. During Cross-examinations, Mr. Wortzman directly addressed the issue of whether or not Way would be prepared to provide an arbitrator with effective control over his developments, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Q. Are you seriously suggesting that you would be prepared to enter into a real estate development and have an arbitrator tell you what you have to do and what you can't do? Is that what you are saying?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Q. . . . Are you telling me that you would be content to have an arbitrator determine your obligations and liabilities under a real estate development pursuant to the shareholders agreement?</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 18, 2018 at pp. 233&ndash;235, qq. 866&ndash;868.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>84. These questions posed by Mr. Wortzman although proper given Way's evidence were refused. Way did, however, admit that he did not even know what an arbitrator could impose. An adverse inference should be drawn that Way would never agree to an arbitrator crafting the terms of joint venture for him; who would?
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 18, 2018 at pp. 233&ndash;235, qq. 866&ndash;868.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>85. It is commercially unreasonable that an arbitrator or Judge could or would, in effect, create the material terms of a contractual relationship and impose those material contractual terms on the parties and ultimately decide the process and structure pursuant to which a redevelopment (or multiple redevelopments) would proceed.</P>
<P>86. It is equally unbelievable that Way would ever be prepared to give up full control over any possible redevelopment projects to an arbitrator's discretion when, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) during the Receivership Motion in the Main Action, Way brought a cross-motion seeking &ldquo;<EM>unfettered control</EM>&rdquo; and restraining Schembri from participating with respect to the Waterloo, London and Oshawa Properties' redevelopment; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Way himself has stated that he would not proceed with the Waterloo, Oshawa and London Projects unless he had control. He would rather &ldquo;<EM>let them sit there for the next hundred years</EM>&rdquo;.
<P2><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated June 28, 2010 at pp. 679&ndash;681, qq. 3830&ndash;3840.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>87. It is submitted that, even if Way was prepared to relinquish control (which Schembri refutes), an arbitrator's role is not to decide (1) whether a new company should do the development, (2) who the officers and directors would be, (3) what shares would be owned by whom and in what percentage, (4) what financing would be required, (5) who would guarantee the financing, (6) who would fund the equity, (7) how much equity would be required, (8) the value of sweat equity, (9) upon a tendering process, and (9) the myriad of other terms required for a development to proceed. It is also not the arbitrator's role to approve or create budgets. An arbitrator cannot enforce the performance of a whole contract where it would involve creating, drafting or implying terms upon which the parties did not agree or turn their minds. The Courts will not even engage in such an exercise.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bitton v. Cheeroune et al</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 2434</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;<EM>Bitton</EM>&rdquo;), at para 58, DBA at Tab 9;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Kloepfer Wholesale Hardware v.

<P>88. Schembri submits that there is no valid or enforceable contract as between the parties. For a valid contract to exist, the courts must find that the parties had a mutual intention to create a legally binding contract and reach an agreement with respect to all of the essential terms of the contract. An agreement is unenforceable if essential provisions intended to govern the contractual relationship are uncertain and have not been settled or agreed upon.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Bitton</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 58, DBA at Tab 9;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Demir v. Kilic</SOC><YEAR>2018</YEAR><CITE>ONSC 949</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>DBA at Tab 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>89. Here, it is clear that the parties have not reached an agreement which includes the essential terms necessary to govern their contractual relationship. At most, the Non-Competition Clause represents an &ldquo;<EM>agreement to possibly agree</EM>&rdquo; with respect to future real estate development opportunities. This is consistent with Schembri' recollection of Mr. Volpini's statements at the January 2008 Shareholder Meeting that it was the parties' intention that the said agreement would only be in effect for the redevelopment of the Oshawa, Waterloo, and London Properties. Way and Schembri had already agreed to proceed with these developments. Any other or future developments would also require their consent and agreement. This is the only commercially reasonable way to interpret the Non-Competition Clause.</P>
<P>90. It is trite law that agreements to agree are not enforceable. Accordingly, the Non-Competition Clause which creates an &ldquo;<EM>agreement to possibly agree</EM>&rdquo; cannot stand.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Bitton</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 57, DBA at Tab 9.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IS UNREASONABLE</UNDER></TI>
<P>91. Even if this Honourable Court finds that the Non-Competition Clause is unambiguous and capable of being enforced, Schembri submits that the said Clause is unreasonable and unlawful and therefore ought to be struck.</P>
<P>92. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that it is only after the restrictive covenant has been found to <UNDER>not</UNDER> be ambiguous, that, as a general rule, the following elements should be analyzed in determining whether or not a restrictive covenant is otherwise reasonable:
<P1>(a) The geographic coverage of the covenant;</P1>
<P1>(b) The period of time in which the covenant is effective; and</P1>
<P1>(c) The extent of the activity sought to be prohibited.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Shafron</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 26, DBA at Tab 2.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>93. Of overarching importance to the reasonableness inquiry is whether or not the restrictive covenant's term, territory and activities to which it applies, is restricted <UNDER>to whatever is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interest of the party in whose favour it was granted</UNDER>.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Payette</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 61, DBA at Tab 4;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>853947B.C. Ltd. v.

Dunlop Industrial Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1982] CarswellOnt 780</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>DBA at Tab 7;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>94. If a covenant is not clear as to activity, time, or geography, it is not possible to demonstrate that it is reasonable. It is therefore unreasonable and unenforceable.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Martin</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 51, DBA at Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>95. The reasonableness of a restrictive covenant is fact-specific and can only be determined after looking at the overall context of the covenant and the relationship between the parties.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Source Office</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 30, DBA at Tab 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Geographic Scope</UNDER></TI>
<P>96. If this Court finds that the term &ldquo;Region of Waterloo&rdquo; is not ambiguous, then the geographic scope of the Non-Competition Clause is not at issue.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Temporal Limits are Unreasonable</UNDER></TI>
<P>97. The Non-Competition Clause is in effect according to the express words of Article 13:
<QUOTE><P>. . . . <UNDER><EM>During the period which SCHEMBRI FINANCIAL is a shareholder of the Corporation [Triumph Financial]</EM></UNDER>, <EM>it shall have the ongoing obligation to present to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. This obligation to KINGSLEY FINANCIAL and the Corporation</EM> <UNDER><EM>shall also extend to GORDON SCHEMBRI personally and any other legal entity in which he has an interest, either directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise</EM></UNDER>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>98. The Shareholder Agreement also states that it is binding on Schembri and Way's heirs in perpetuity.</P>
<P>99. The Non-Competition Clause is in force until such time as Schembri Financial divests its shares in Triumph Financial. As constituted, the Shareholder Agreement does not allow Schembri or Schembri Financial to divest of its shares in Triumph Financial without the consent of Way. Therefore the clause is in effect until Way consents otherwise and is purportedly binding on future generations of the Way and Schembri families.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1864, q. 1839&ndash;1841.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>100. During cross-examinations, Way was asked for his understanding of when the Non-Competition Clause terminates. According to Way there is no end date to the clause's application.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1861, q. 1822.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>101. In fact, Way has taken the position that the Non-Competition Clause extends beyond his and/or Schembri's death and applies to both Way and Schembri's heirs:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Q.Just so I understand your perspective, this is binding on you and Gord and it's binding on your daughter and Gord's kids and your daughter's kids and Gord's kids' kids and potentially, their kids' kids; is that where we are?</EM></P>
<P><EM>A. That is what it says</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015, p. 1864, q. 1838.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>102. The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed that a Non-Competition Clause in a commercial contract must have a temporal limit. In this regard, the Court in <BOLD><EM>Payette</EM></BOLD> stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>A non-competition clause in a commercial contract must of course be limited as to time, or it will be found to contrary to public order and a Court will refuse to give effect to it</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Payette</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 63, DBA at Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>103. Additionally, the Court of Appeal has found that a restrictive covenant has no temporal limits where it is dependent upon a party to make a determination as to its end. Such clauses are unenforceable for that reason alone.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Martin</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 6, 59, DBA at Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>104. There is no basis to support the necessity or enforceability of the indefinite time period in the Non-Competition Clause or that it is necessary to protect any legitimate business interest of Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial while binding Schembri and Way's children and grandchildren. The time period is indeterminate and accordingly unreasonable and must be deemed unenforceable as against public interest, in accordance with the binding authority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Payette</EM> and the Court of Appeal in <EM>Martin</EM>.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Payette</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 63, DBA at Tab 4; <EM>Martin</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 6, 59, DBA at Tab 3.</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>United Rentals of Canada Inc. v.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>An Inherent Stalemate</UNDER></TI>
<P>105. Additionally, the Shareholder Agreement expressly provides at Article 2 (c) (xv):
<QUOTE><SEC><N>2.</N><SECP>The parties hereto agree,
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>that during the currency of this Agreement, the parties agree that without the consent of the shareholders representing not less than ONE HUNDRED (100%) per cent of the voting shares of the capital stock of the corporation:
<SPARA><N>(xv)</N><SPARAP>no projects will be undertaken or initiated by the Corporation [Triumph Financial] without project feasibility studies and construction budget approvals.</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA></SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>106. Through his examinations for discovery, Way has confirmed that without Schembri's approval of a project feasibility study and construction budget, no projects could be pursued by Triumph Financial. This supports Schembri's interpretation of the Clause that it would only apply if the parties agreed to all terms.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of A. Way dated January 16, 2015 at pp.1897&ndash;1900, qq.2021&ndash;2035.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>107. Accordingly, without Schembri's approval, no future development is possible. Schembri has made clear that he will not work with Way in the future and so no approval will be granted.</P>
<P>108. The Non-Competition Clause is again practically unworkable unless the parties agree to develop together and agree on all terms of such a development.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>CLAUSE UNNECESSARY TO PROTECT LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>109. As set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <BOLD><EM>Payette</EM></BOLD>, a non-competition covenant is unreasonable if it is not necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the party in whose favour it was granted. Since all of its assets were placed in Receivership, Triumph Financial is no longer in business and accordingly has no legitimate interests to protect. Kingsley Financial is not and never was a developer. It is a company used solely by Way as a conduit for the movement of monies. It has no legitimate interest to protect.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Payette</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 61, DBA at Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>110. Way and the Way Group have continued conduct significant business since entering into the Shareholder Agreement without Schembri's involvement.</P>
<P>111. During the course of the Main Action, the corporate tax returns filed by Triumph Financial, for the period June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2016, were produced. They listed approximately 36 of Way's &ldquo;related and associated corporations.&rdquo; Way, during cross-examination, admitted that the assets of those associated companies is accurately listed a just over $172,000,000.00, the capital is $88,169,000.00, the revenues are $24,773,000.00, and that a portion of the said capital, assets, and revenues generated, were generated through Way's real estate development business.

<P>112. Since it is only Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial that have the benefit of the Non-Competition Clause, Way's other business interests do not require protection.</P>
<P>113. Additionally, during his examinations, Way admitted that:
<P1>(a) Prior to meeting Schembri, he had never &ldquo;as an investment, went out, acquired land, assembled it, re-zoned it, developed it as a student housing business</P1>
<P1>(b) Except in the joint venture with Schembri, never carried on the business of student housing in the Waterloo Region;</P1>
<P1>(c) Since the development of 345 King Street, (1) he continues to carry on business as a developer, (2) he has the resources necessary to carry on business, (3) he has continued to build apartment buildings, some of which have students in them, (4) he has not been restricted from looking for properties for development purposes in the Waterloo area, and (5) nothing that Schembri did or didn't do in breach of the Non-Competition Clause prevented him from further development.

<P>114. In fact, the Region of Waterloo Planning, Development and Legislative Services, Community Planning Report prepared with respect to &ldquo;<EM>2017 Building Permit Activity and Growth Monitoring</EM>&rdquo; sets out that there has been approximately $10-11 billion dollars of value in building permits issued between 2008 and 2017. In the face of this information at cross-examinations, Way refused to answer whether there was a &ldquo;<EM>lack of opportunities for [him] to develop real estate in the Region of Waterloo</EM>&rdquo; and refused to agree that there is &ldquo;<EM>plenty of development opportunities in the Region of Waterloo</EM>.&rdquo; This Court ought to draw an adverse inference from Way's refusals. In any event, Way's own financial filings suggest that there are plenty of opportunities for Way and/or his entities to develop real estate.

<P>115. Although Way does not personally receive the benefit of the Non-Competition Clause he has joined as a Plaintiff in any event. Way has:
<P1>(a) Acknowledged that he does not have the capacity to do an endless number of developments. He confirmed that he can only develop 1-2 properties in a given year and that since 2009, he has developed at least 8 properties. In this regard, Way has been operating at max capacity and has suffered no losses as he would not have been able to participate in any development in the Waterloo Region proposed by Schembri or he replaced them with his own development opportunities. If he has damages, he has mitigated them;

<P1>(c) Attempted to revise his evidence two years later by saying that the legitimate business interest that he was protecting was his interest with respect to &ldquo;redevelopment&rdquo;. Way again confirmed that Triumph Financial is defunct and Kingsley Financial is not a developer, and despite the Clause he remains free to develop any property that he wants in the Region of Waterloo.

<P>122. Way's Affidavit sworn March 16, 2018, states that Schembri was in breach of the Non-Competition Clause for failure to present to Kingsley Financial or Triumph Financial a prospective real estate opportunity with respect to 359 King Street (the Waterloo Property&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Way Affidavit sworn March 16, 2018, PMR, Tab A, at para. 398.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><TI>The Receivership Proceedings relating to the Waterloo Property</TI>
<P>123. Way includes the Waterloo Property in This Action notwithstanding that it was the subject of numerous Court Orders and the fact that the Court of Appeal ordered that the Receiver sell it to Schembri</P>
<P>124. The parties in the Receivership Proceedings consented to a &ldquo;Sales Process Order&rdquo; with respect to the London and Waterloo Properties.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at paras. 37-38.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>125. The Honourable Justice Mesbur's (&ldquo;Justice Mesbur&rdquo;) Sale Process Order contemplated a two stage sales process. The first stage was solicitation of offers from Way and Schembri to purchase the said Properties. In the event that no acceptable offers were received in stage one from Way or Schembri, then the Receiver was to market and sell the Properties on the open market.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 39.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>126. Schembri complied with Justice Mesbur's Sales Process Order and submitted an offer to the Receiver to purchase the Waterloo Property. Way did not submit any offer. The Receiver accordingly brought a motion to approve the sale of the Waterloo property to Schembri.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 42.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>127. Instead, of complying with the agreed upon Sales Process Order:
<P1>(a) Way brought a frivolous motion to remove the Receiver (the &ldquo;Removal Motion&rdquo;) and derailed the Sales Process with respect to Schembri's purchase of the Waterloo Property;</P1>
<P1>(b) Well after the Court imposed deadline and after Schembri had disclosed his offers, Way submitted confusing offers to purchase the Waterloo, London and Oshawa Properties. None of the offers made by Way were made pursuant to the Sales Process Order; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Used the Removal Motion tactically, and engaged in secret negotiations with the Receiver (without Schembri's knowledge) convincing the Receiver to support and approve Way's offers to purchase the Properties in exchange for Way's agreement to abandon the Removal Motion without costs.
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at paras. 44-45, 49&ndash;53.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>128. Way abandoned the Removal Motion and the Receiver brought a motion to have an amended Sales Process approved before Justice Mesbur.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR Tab 2, at para. 53.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>129. In her Endorsement, Justice Mesbur made significant findings of fact regarding Way's conduct and the relationship as between Way and Schembri. In this regard, Justice Mesbur found, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) <BOLD>Because of the falling out between Mr. Schembri and Mr. Way and the likelihood they would fail to cooperate with one another, both agreed that a neutral third party was necessary, but Mr. Way resisted appointing a receiver.</BOLD> Roberts J. found it just and convenient to appoint a receiver in order to &ldquo;<EM>protect the positions of the parties pending the completion of the projects and the final determination of the parties' disputes</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) Way <BOLD>&ldquo;<EM>attacked the Receiver's impartiality and integrity</EM>&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>I am troubled by the way the original sales process has got off the rails</EM> ... <BOLD><EM>Mr. Schembri complied with the sales order. Mr. Way did not.&rdquo;</EM></BOLD></P1>
<P1>(d) &ldquo;<EM>Removing a Receiver is a serious matter. Mr. Way had called the Receiver's integrity into question, and this issue had to be determined. From Mr. Schembri's point of view, the removal motion was tactical, and designed to derail the sales process so that Mr. Way could gain an advantage in it. To some extent, I tend to agree</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(e) <BOLD>&ldquo;<EM>When I look at the timing of the removal motion, coupled with Mr. Way's later unsolicited bids for the three properties, I see a tactical move to rest control of the process from the Receiver, and to prevent Mr. Schembri from purchasing Waterloo or to force him to pay significantly more for it than its appraised value</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(f) &ldquo;<EM>What troubles me is that accepting the Receiver's recommendations in large part rewards Mr. Way and condones his behaviour. He had the opportunity to prevent a proper bid as contemplated by the sales order. He chose not to. Instead, he made unsolicited bids while attacking the Receiver's integrity</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(g) &ldquo;<EM>But this is not about Mr. Schembri and Mr. Way</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Their bitterness and ill will towards one another is palpable and will no doubt continue and colour all of their future decisions. It is not the Court's function to facilitate or enable their bitterness and anger</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>Instead, the Court must determine whether the Receiver's proposal is in the overall interest of the Estate and is commercially reasonable</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(h) &ldquo;<EM>As to the fairness or unfairness of the process, both parties have legitimate complaints</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Those complaints, however, have more to do with their own behaviour and wish to crush the other than with the Receiver's exercise of reasonable judgment on the context of the sales process</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(i) &ldquo;<EM>Although this case cries out to be settled, the parties seem to have little appetite for a reasonable settlement</EM>, <BOLD><EM>and would prefer to litigate until all their assets have been spent&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 55.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>130. Despite Justice Mesbur's findings, the revised Sales Process was approved and the Sales Process Order amended. Justice Mesbur's decision was, however, quickly overturned by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal which ordered that Schembri was entitled to buy the Waterloo Property from the Receiver and also made adverse findings with respect to Way's conduct:
<P1>(a) <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;The conduct of Mr. Way had a negative impact on the integrity of the Court supervised sales process&rdquo;;</EM></BOLD></P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>His (Way's) conduct, as it impacted on the integrity of the sales process, should have been given significant weight when deciding whether the Receiver's recommendation to accept Mr. Way's proposal should be approved by the Court</EM>.&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 56.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>131. Ultimately, because it was impossible for Way and Schembri to be partners, the Waterloo and London Properties were sold to Schembri and/or corporations which he controlled pursuant to the Sales Process Order. Way and/or a numbered company which he controls purchased the Oshawa Property.</P>
<P>132. Of significance and the reason why this is relevant is that at no time did Way raise the issue of or even reference the Non-Competition Clause during the Sales Process as it relates to the Waterloo Property.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, MMR Tab 2, at para. 59.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>133. Additionally, Way consented to the Honourable Mr. Justice Campbell signing a Vesting Order in the form prescribed by the <EM>Land Titles Act</EM> and/or the <EM>Land Registry Reform Act</EM> be registered, vesting the sale to Schembri clean of any claims.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at para. 58.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>134. Accordingly, the sale of the Waterloo Property to Schembri was done pursuant to a Court Ordered process. The issue was determined by the Court of Appeal. Way never raised the Non-Competition Clause during the entire process. Way had the opportunity to purchase the Waterloo Lands, if he wished, subject to compliance with the Sales Process Order. Way chose not to do so.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at para. 59.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>135. Importantly, paragraph 3 of the Vesting Order expressly states, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<QUOTE><P><EM>3. THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that upon the delivery of a Receiver's certificate to the Purchaser substantially in the form attached as Schedule A hereto (the &ldquo;Receiver's Certificate&rdquo;), all of the Receiver's or 359 King Ontario Inc.'s right, title and interest in and to the property described in the Sale Agreement and listed on Schedule B hereto (the &ldquo;Purchased Property&rdquo;) hereto shall vest absolutely in the Purchaser</EM>, <BOLD><EM>free and clear of and from any and all security interests (whether contractual, statutory, or otherwise), hypothecs, mortgages, levies, charges, or other financial or monetary claims, whether or not they have attached or been perfected, registered or filed and whether secured, unsecured or otherwise (collectively, the &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;)</EM>.</BOLD> [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at paras. 58&ndash;61, Exhibit H.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>136. Way's attempts to obtain an interest in the Waterloo Property through this Action is an abuse of process and a collateral attack on the Order of the Court of Appeal of Ontario and the Order of Justice Campbell, wherein the Waterloo Property was vested in a company operated by Schembri. In this regard, Way continues his practice of ignoring or disregarding Court Orders.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at para. 62.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>137. During his cross-examinations, Way was asked why he never raised the Non-Competition Clause with Justice Mesbur or the Court of Appeal. Way refused to answer.</P>
<P>138. Despite the fact that Way has confirmed that &ldquo;<EM>paragraph 3</EM> [of Justice Campbell's Order dated August 2, 2012] <EM>speaks for itself</EM>&rdquo;, and that he consented to the Sales Process and Vesting Orders, Way still refuses to dismiss the action with connection to the Waterloo Property.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018, at pp. 79&ndash;85, qq. 287&ndash;310.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Columbia Street Lands</UNDER></TI>
<P>139. Way's Action as it relates to 61 Columbia Street ought to be summarily dismissed as Way chose not to participate in the development. The record before this Court is also clear that the claim is statute barred pursuant to the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>.</P>
<P>140. Prior to Schembri's discovery of Way's frauds, Schembri advised Way that he was intending to develop student housing on Columbia Street. Way advised Schembri that he had no interest at all in the acquisition or development of student housing in the Waterloo Region.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at paras. 70, 71.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>141. This is particularly so with respect to 61 Columbia Street. The evidence is clear that it was in fact Triumph Financial that entered into the Agreement of Purchase and Sale for 61 Columbia Street. Schembri asked Way to use Triumph Financial as purchaser in an effort to disguise him as the real purchaser from the vendor in an attempt to keep the cost of acquisition down. Way did so. Way had no interest in developing 61 Columbia Street and accordingly he agreed to assign the Agreement of Purchase and Sale from Triumph Financial to one of Schembri's corporate entities, 1765998 Ontario Inc. (&ldquo;176&rdquo;). 176 ended up purchasing 61 Columbia Street and building student houses thereon.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri's Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1, at para. 72.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>142. Through cross-examination, Way has admitted that 61 Columbia Street was under contract with Triumph Financial in trust and it was eventually purchased by a company controlled by Schembri, being 1765998 Ontario Inc.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018, at pp. 144&ndash;148, qq. 579&ndash;597.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>143. It is difficult to understand Way's Action regarding this property since he knew of it, tied it up, assigned the APS to Schembri and &ldquo;took a pass&rdquo; on the development. Additionally, the APS with respect to 61 Columbia Street was entered into more than two years from the date upon which the within Action was commenced. This action as it relates to 61 Columbia is statute barred pursuant to the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>BIFURCATION&mdash;LIABILITY AND DAMAGES</UNDER></TI>
<P>144. Schembri submits that if this motion is dismissed the issue of liability ought to be bifurcated from the issue of damages.</P>
<P>145. Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> sets out as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>With the consent of the parties, the court may order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including separate hearings on the issues of liability</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg. 194, Rule 6.1.01</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>146. Despite the text of Rule 6.1.01, the Court has held that in non-jury cases, the Court has discretion to order bifurcation without the consent of the parties.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Duggan v. Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corporation</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 1811</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(&ldquo;Duggan&rdquo;), DBA at Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>147. In his <EM>Civil Reform Project: Summary of Findings &amp; Recommendations</EM>, the Honourable Coulter A. Osborne stated as follows with respect to the bifurcation of proceedings:
<QUOTE><P><EM>While I view bifurcation to be the exception, cost considerations militate in favour of bifurcation in some cases</EM>. <BOLD><EM>In commercial litigation, for example, when dealing with damages will expose a party and sometimes all parties to significant costs, it may make sense to separate the issues of liability and damages and deal with liability first</EM>.</BOLD> <EM>Upon the determination of one issue, the parties may be inclined to settle the balance of the issues in dispute. This can result in a significant savings of time, money and judicial resources. It would also be of a particular benefit to those litigants who cannot afford a trial of all issues</EM>. [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Duggan</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 3, DBA at Tab 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>148. In this Action, Way seeks significant production with respect to various properties acquired by Schembri and/or his entities following entering into the Shareholder Agreement. Similarly, Schembri would require production by way of all of the documents relating to developments his companies did to see if he mitigated damages. None of the requested information is required to determine whether or not the Non-Competition Clause is enforceable or if Schembri is liable to Way for any breaches thereof.</P>
<P>149. Schembri respectfully submits that bifurcating the issues of liability and damages in the present Action is, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) efficient and may promote settlement; and</P1>
<P1>(b) in the interests of justice; and</P1>
<P1>(c) consistent with the overarching purpose enunciated in Rule 1.04 which provides that the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure are to &ldquo;be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.&rdquo;</EM> [para 69]
<P2><BOLD><EM>Duggan</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 69, DBA at Tab 12; <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg. 194 at Rule 1.04.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P>150. Schembri respectfully seeks:
<P1>(a) A declaration that the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable and of no force and effect;</P1>

<P1>(c) In the alternative, an Order that the Action be dismissed as it relates to the properties known as 359 King Street and 61 Columbia Street;</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> This motion involves, among other things, the duties owed by the defendant, Gordon Schembri <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;)</BOLD> in his capacity as a director and officer of the plaintiff, Triumph Financial Holdings Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;Triumph&rdquo;);</BOLD> a company that he incorporated with the plaintiff, Al Way <BOLD>(&ldquo;Way&rdquo;),</BOLD> his fellow director and officer, to carry out multi-million dollar real estate developments.</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> Schembri and his companies, commenced an action in February, 2010 against, among others, Way and Triumph (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>3.</BOLD> The plaintiffs commenced the within action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;)</BOLD> six years ago in respect of Schembri's numerous independent premediated breaches of certain of his fiduciary duties over many years, and consequent diversion of corporate opportunities (individually, a <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Breach&rdquo;;</BOLD> and collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Breaches&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>4.</BOLD> By orders on consent, the Main Action and the ROFR Action are to be tried together. Schembri set the Main Action down for trial in June, 2017.</P>
<P><BOLD>5.</BOLD> Schembri orchestrated the ROFR Breaches both before and after the Main Action by acquiring twenty-seven properties at a cost of more than $15 million (as particularized in <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto) that he subsequently developed into six separate properties that have made him very wealthy; concurrently, the funds belonging to Mr. Way from the JV Project (defined in paragraph 13(a) below) remain tied up in the receivership proceedings, while Schembri refuses to comply with documentary disclosure requirements in furtherance of his efforts to bankrupt Way.</P>
<P><BOLD>6.</BOLD> After failing to bankrupt Way (together with the plaintiffs, Kingsley Financial Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;KFI&rdquo;)</BOLD> and Triumph, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Group&rdquo;)</BOLD> by:
<P1>(a) refusing to provide approximately $3 million as required by the Contribution Clause (defined in paragraph 27 below);</P1>
<P1>(b) breaching his fiduciary duties as an officer and director of Triumph and its' three subsidiaries; and</P1>
<P1>(c) engaging in scorched earth litigation tactics;</P1></P>
<P>Schembri has brought belatedly the within motion seeking summary dismissal of the ROFR Action in an attempt to avoid: (i) complying with his disclosure obligations; (ii) scrutiny of his oppressive conduct; and (iii) liability for the ROFR Breaches.</P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> Schembri (together with the corporate defendants, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri Group&rdquo;)</BOLD> is doing so:
<P1>(a) while refusing to produce numerous relevant documents and answer relevant questions (in breach of the Rules of Civil Procedure) that will:
<P2>(i) expose the scope of the ROFR Breaches; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) reveal the quantum of damages suffered by the Way Group; and</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) without ever explaining his inordinate delay after representing to the Way Group and the Court in 2014 that they were bringing a motion for summary judgment in the ROFR Action that year (the <BOLD>&ldquo;2014 Schembri ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>8.</BOLD> The Schembri Group seeks to persuade this Honourable Court that the dispute in the ROFR Action is simply an issue of contract interpretation; a contract (namely, a unanimous shareholder agreement (described in paragraphs 27 and 28 below)) that Schembri has and continues to seek to uphold and enforce against the Way Group throughout the course of eight years of litigation in the Main Action.</P>
<P><BOLD>9.</BOLD> Schembri's assertion that the ROFR Clause (defined in paragraph 27 below) in the unanimous shareholder is ambiguous is inconsistent with:
<P1>(a) Schembri's conduct prior to commencement of the Main Action; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Schembri's position asserted in the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim delivered in the spring of 2010.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> While commencing and participating in various motions in the Main Action over several years, Schembri concealed the ROFR Breaches and never sought to be relieved of his obligation under the ROFR Clause.</P>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> Schembri attempts to support the within motion on the basis of his unproven allegations in the Main Action, and the improper use of interlocutory decisions in the Main Action.</P></BLOCK1>

<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> The events that are the subject matter of the Main Action date back to 2006; whereas, the events that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action date back to 2008. At the material times, Way's companies employed around 100 people; whereas Schembri had one employee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Alven J.

<P><BOLD>13.</BOLD> The document intensive and protracted dispute between Way and Schembri revolves around:
<P1>(a) one completed real estate development at 345 King Street, Waterloo, Ontario <BOLD>(&ldquo;345 King&rdquo;)</BOLD> that was carried out as a joint venture (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Project&rdquo;)</BOLD> pursuant to a joint venture agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Agreement&rdquo;)</BOLD> entered into in April, 2007 (as depicted in <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto); and</P1>
<P1>(b) three interrupted real estate developments in Waterloo, London and Oshawa, Ontario (individually, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Waterloo Lands&rdquo;,</BOLD> the <BOLD>&ldquo;London Lands&rdquo;</BOLD> and the <BOLD>&ldquo;Oshawa Lands&rdquo;,</BOLD> respectively; and collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Lands&rdquo;)</BOLD> that were carried out pursuant to a shareholder agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Shareholder Agreement&rdquo;)</BOLD> entered into in April, 2008 (as depicted in <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, pages 10 and 11, paragraph 34</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>14.</BOLD> Schembri is:
<P1>(a) disputing the costs associated with the JV Project, in part based on the budget that formed part of the JV Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Accounting Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(b) disputing the use of monies from the sale of 345 King to fund the acquisition and commence the redevelopment of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rollover Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD> pursuant to an oral agreement between Way and Schembri to do so (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Rollover Agreement&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) alleging that his receipt, directly or indirectly, of $1.4 million in the spring of 2009 was an advance against profits as opposed to a short-term loan (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Loan Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(d) disputing 172's repayment of funds advanced by Way's companies prior to 172 obtaining construction financing (the <BOLD>&ldquo;JV Repayment Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(e) disputing certain of the costs associated with the redevelopment of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Costs Dispute&rdquo;);</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(f) disputing his obligation to contribute to the costs associated with the redevelopment of the Triumph Lands (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Triumph Contribution Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD> as provided for in the Contribution Clause; and</P1>
<P1>(g) disputing his obligation to present all real estate development opportunities which he acquired in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo to the Way Group (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Dispute&rdquo;)</BOLD> as required by the ROFR Clause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, pages 11 and 12, paragraph 35</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The JV Agreement</TI>

<P><BOLD>92.</BOLD> These two disputes are intertwined.</P>
<P><BOLD>93.</BOLD> Regarding the Triumph Contribution Dispute, Schembri has alleged that Way was required to fund the Triumph Lands, at no interest, unless Way obtained financing elsewhere supported, if necessary, by guarantees from Way and his companies but not Schembri or his companies. As Schembri has now admitted, there is no such requirement in the Shareholder Agreement. Moreover, Schembri's allegation in this regard was not asserted in the Statement of Claim, but rather the Amended Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 102, paragraphs 362 and 363</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>94.</BOLD> Regarding the Rollover Dispute, Schembri has acknowledged he injected funds into Triumph pursuant to the Rollover Agreement (as stated in paragraph 51 above). The only issue is the amount of the amount of his injection, which Schembri alleges depends on the determination of the JV Accounting Dispute.</P>
<P><BOLD>95.</BOLD> It is absurd to suggest that Way would bear the risk of funding the development of the Triumph Lands (estimated to cost approximately $74,000,000 in the aggregate) in exchange for a 55% interest in Triumph, while Schembri would have no risk (according to his alleged interpretation of the Contribution Clause) in exchange for a 45% interest in Triumph.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 102, paragraph 364</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The Loan Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>96.</BOLD> Regardless of whether the $1.4 million was a short term loan (as it was) or an advance against his share of the profits from the JV Project (as Schembri alleges), the fact is that Schembri received the benefit of $1.4 million. Moreover, Schembri still filed claims for $5 million in the receivership proceedings as against each of the Triumph subsidiaries.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 102, paragraph 364</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>

<P><BOLD>97.</BOLD> Schembri knows that 172 did not have any funds of its own to purchase the five properties that he had tied up previously. Schembri also knows that the JV Agreement permitted 172 to repay advances prior to any distribution. Both were addressed in the Deloitte Report and commented upon by Justice Turnbull.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 102, paragraph 366</P>

<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>The Triumph Costs Dispute</TI>
<P><BOLD>98.</BOLD> As stated above, the Receiver conducted a claims procedure. Both Way and Schembri consented to the claims procedure and caused substantial claims to be filed. The Receiver reviewed the claims filed, made certain determinations and reported on these activities to the Court. The Court approved the activities of the Receiver, without exception. The Receiver allowed various third party claims and paid them in full, on consent of Way and Schembri and with the approval of the court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 103, paragraphs 369 to 371</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>99.</BOLD> Subsequently, Schembri sought to amend the Amended Statement of Claim in the Main Action to allege fraud in respect of claims Way caused to be filed with the Receiver for &ldquo;unauthorized and unapproved services&rdquo; as asserted in paragraph 86A (a), (b) and (c) of the Amended Amended Statement of Claim. Only Premier provided services; whereas &lsquo;Kingsley Financial&rsquo; and &lsquo;1725030 Ont.&rsquo; provided funds. This was addressed in the Deloitte Report.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, page 103, paragraphs 372 and 373</P>

<P><BOLD>101.</BOLD> Schembri is not an employee of Triumph; he is a director and officer. As such, Schembri owes fiduciary duties to Triumph and his fellow director and officer, Way. Schembri also has a contractual obligation to KFI pursuant to the ROFR Clause.</P>
<P><BOLD>102.</BOLD> Schembri admits that he did not comply with the ROFR Clause when he acquired twenty-six properties in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo that he has since developed. There are likely more properties that Schembri has acquired.</P>
<P><BOLD>103.</BOLD> It is clear that Schembri has breached his: (a) fiduciary duties to Triumph; (b) fiduciary duties to Way; and (c) contractual duty to KFI.</P>
<P><BOLD>104.</BOLD> It is essential to note that Schembri breaches of his duties above both preceded the Main Action and continued for at least four more years, while he reaped the financial benefits and Way laboured under the financial burden of having millions of dollars in capital stranded in the receivership proceedings.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><N>1.</N><TI>Fiduciary Duty of a Director</TI>
<P><BOLD>105.</BOLD> As stated in paragraphs 26(a), and 29(b) and (c) above, Schembri is an officer and director of Triumph and each of its' three subsidiaries. As stated in paragraph 24(a) above, Schembri, through Schembri Financial Limited, is a forty-five percent (45%) shareholder of Triumph, which itself is the sole shareholder of the three subsidiaries.</P>
<P><BOLD>106.</BOLD> The fiduciary duty of a director and officer to a corporation arises from statute and common law. Section 134(1) of the Ontario <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM> provides that:

<P><BOLD>114.</BOLD> The Way Group has not been able to find much authority analyzing s. 134(2) of the OBCA.

<P><BOLD>116.</BOLD> As stated in paragraph 27 above, Schembri agreed in the Shareholder Agreement (that confirmed his appointment as a director and officer of Triumph) to present to Triumph all real estate development opportunities which he may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. Schembri admits he did not present to Triumph twenty-six properties in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo that he acquired and developed.</P>
<P><BOLD>117.</BOLD> It is clear that Schembri breached his fiduciary duties to Triumph repeatedly over many years by:
<P1>(a) committing a ROFR Breach in March, 2009 (as detailed in paragraph 48 above);</P1>
<P1>(b) failing to disclose his interest in the Taylorwood Property at the Director's Meeting held on April 12, 2010 (as detailed in paragraph 53 above);</P1>
<P1>(c) committing a ROFR Breach in April, 2010 (as detailed in paragraph 55 above);</P1>
<P1>(d) refusing to contribute (as detailed in paragraphs 56 and 57 above);</P1>
<P1>(e) blocking arbitration in July, 2010 (as detailed in paragraph 58 above);</P1>
<P1>(f) filing improper claims in the receivership proceedings in March, 2011 (as detailed in paragraphs 59 to 66 above);</P1>
<P1>(g) committing a ROFR Breach in August, 2011 (as detailed in paragraph 68 above);</P1>

<P1>(a) blocking arbitration in July, 2010 by failing to swear the affidavit referred to in the Notice of Motion that was served but never filed (as detailed in paragraph 58 above);</P1>
<P1>(b) filing fraudulent and improper claims in the receivership proceedings in March, 2011 (as detailed in paragraph 61 above);</P1>

<P1>(d) blocking payment to CRA (as detailed in paragraphs 72 and 73 above); and</P1>
<P1>(e) the 2014 Schembri ROFR SJ Motion (as detailed in paragraphs 76 to 80 above).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>130.</BOLD> Regarding the 2014 Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, Schembri never explained his deception, nor sought any amendments to the ROFR Timetable Order. Instead, Schembri carried on as if:
<P1>(a) he never represented repeatedly that he was bringing the 2014 Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P1>
<P1>(b) there was no schedule for the 2014 Schembri ROFR SJ Motion in the ROFR Timetable Order;</P1>
<P1>(c) it is just a game to represent repeatedly that a motion for summary judgment is being brought to dismiss a claim seeking damages in the amount of $30 million dollars; and</P1>
<P1>(d) he is above the Rules of Civil Procedure and orders of this Honourable Court.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>131.</BOLD> Schembri has breached the following Rules of Civil Procedure:
<P1>(a) Rule 30.02(1) which requires Schembri to disclose &ldquo;[e]very document relevant to any matter in issue in an action that is or has been in [his] possession, control or power&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>(b) Rule 30.07(b) which requires, after serving the ROFR AoD, discovers that it is inaccurate or incomplete must &ldquo;forthwith serve a supplementary affidavit specifying the extent to which the affidavit of documents requires modification and disclosing additional docuents;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) Rule 31.06(1) which requires Schembri to &ldquo;answer, to the best of his...knowledge, information and belief, any proper question relevant to any matter in issue in the action&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Rule 31.07(1)(c) which requires Schembri to provide an answer to an undertaking within 60 days.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>132.</BOLD> As a consequence of Schembri's breaches of the Rules of Civil Procedure, this Honurable Court has the authority to make such order as is just.</P>
<P><BOLD>133.</BOLD> The Way Group submits that it is just for this Honourable Court to make an order:
<P1>(a) declaring that the defendant, Schembri Financial Limited <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri Financial&rdquo;)</BOLD> is in breach of the Contribution Clause;</P1>
<P1>(b) declaring that Schembri Financial and Schembri are in breach of the ROFR Clause;</P1>

<P1>(f) requiring the corporate defendants in the ROFR Action to serve an affidavit of documents in the ROFR Action.</P1></P>

<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> This factum is supplementary to the factum of the plaintiffs dated October 17, 2018, and is being delivered in response to:
<P1>(a) the defendants:
<P2>(i) withdrawing certain allegations that the plaintiff, Al Way <BOLD>(&ldquo;Way&rdquo;)</BOLD> and his companies have committed fraud (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Withdrawn Fraud Allegations&rdquo;);</BOLD> and</P2>
<P2>(ii) abandoning their &ldquo;fall back&rdquo; position that was based on the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Abandoned Fallback Position&rdquo;);</BOLD></P2>
without notice, and while counsel was in the midst of oral submissions methodically refuting the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the request of the Honourable Mr. Justice Sloan sent October 22, 2018.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> The Withdrawn Fraud Allegations and the Abandoned Fallback Position are simply another scorched earth litigation tactic in a series of scorched earth litigation tactics that Schembri has been engaged in for more than eight years in furtherance of his efforts to bankrupt Way; while Schembri amasses significant wealth through the acquisition of at least twenty-eight properties in Waterloo Region in breach of:
<P1>(a) his fiduciary duties as a director and officer of Triumph; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the ROFR Clause.</P1></P></BLOCK1>

<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> During the course of oral submissions over two days (namely, October 18<SUP>th</SUP> and 19<SUP>th</SUP>), counsel for Schembri repeatedly alleged fraud and other &ldquo;bad behaviour&rdquo; by Way in his attempts to smear Way before this Honourable Court.</P>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> Following the morning break on October 19<SUP>th</SUP>, counsel for the plaintiffs began his responding submissions and methodically addressed the allegations of fraud and other &ldquo;bad behaviour&rdquo; asserted by Schembri in support of his motion, and advanced by his counsel over two days of submissions to this Honourable Court.</P>
<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> Upon resuming following the afternoon break, counsel for Schembri rose and announced, without prior notice, the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations and the Abandoned Fallback Position.</P>
<P><BOLD>13.</BOLD> In response to this Honourable Court's email on October 22<SUP>nd</SUP> requesting clarification regarding the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations, counsel for Schembri confirmed in writing by letter dated October 25, 2018 that Schembri will no longer be relying upon:
<P1>(a) paragraphs (u), (v) and (w) in the Notice of Motion; and</P1>
<P1>(b) paragraph 3 of the Schembri Factum.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>14.</BOLD> Following a request by counsel for the Way Group, counsel for Schembri confirmed in writing by letter dated October 30, 2018 that Schembri will no longer be relying upon paragraphs (q)(v) in the Notice of Motion. However, Schembri is apparently continuing to rely upon paragraphs 7, 30 and 31 of the Schembri Factum.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES, LAW &amp; AUTHORITIES</TI>
<P><BOLD>Issue 1: What are the consequences of the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations and the Abandoned Fallback Position?</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Issue 2: Is the ROFR Clause invalid and unenforceable as asserted by Schembri?</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Consequences of the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations and the Abandoned Fallback Position</TI>
<P><BOLD>15.</BOLD> Rule 20.06 provides that:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The court may fix and order payment of the costs of a motion for summary judgment by a party on a substantial indemnity basis if</EM>,</P>
<P><EM>(a) the party acted unreasonably by making or responding to the motion; or</EM></P>
<P><EM>(b) the party acted in bad faith for the purpose of delay</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>16.</BOLD> It is plain and obvious that Schembri made a calculated decision to allege fraud by Way in:
<P1>(a) the Notice of Motion dated May 11, 2017 (as detailed in paragraph 4 above);</P1>
<P1>(b) his affidavit sworn May 17, 2017 (as detailed in paragraph 5 above);</P1>
<P1>(c) his affidavit sworn April 5, 2018 (as detailed in paragraph 7 above);</P1>
<P1>(d) the position taken at his cross-examination on September 17, 2018 (as detailed in paragraph 8 above); and</P1>
<P1>(e) the Schembri Factum dated October 9, 2018 (as detailed in paragraph 9 above);</P1>
in an effort to smear Way, thereby distracting this Honourable Court from Schembri's own wrongful conduct. This is not surprising as Schembri has failed to comply with his disclosure obligations under the Rules of Civil Procedure, and is attempting to avoid liability for his repeated breaches of his fiduciary duty estimated at $30 million.</P>
<P><BOLD>17.</BOLD> It is trite law that the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations may attract an award of substantial indemnity costs<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Future Health Inc. v. General Accident Assurance et al</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4834</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>; and such &ldquo;<EM>allegations have been found to be prejudicial to characters or reputations of those to whom they are directed and to attract a higher scale of costs</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Hawkins v.

<P><BOLD>18.</BOLD> In <CASEREF><SOC>1312217 Ontario Ltd v. Atrens</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court found the defendant entitled to costs on a substantial indemnity basis as a result of the Plaintiff discontinuing allegations of conspiracy, but leaving the rest of the claim intact. Justice Kiteley wrote: <EM>&ldquo;For over four years, [the Defendant] was confronted with those serious allegations</EM>. <BOLD><EM>Equally serious cost consequences ought to befall litigants who make such allegations</EM>.</BOLD>&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1312217 Ontario Ltd v.

<P><BOLD>19.</BOLD> In <CASEREF><SOC>Re Cogan</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court wrote:
<QUOTE><P><EM>In summary, a major financial institution has alleged fraud against a solicitor and when the solicitor responded vigorously to defend his reputation, the proceedings (but not the allegations) were abandoned</EM>, <BOLD><EM>thereby depriving the solicitor of the opportunity of obtaining any adjudication or vindication.

<P><BOLD>20.</BOLD> The Way Group submits that imposing serious costs consequences on Schembri for the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations and the Abandoned Fallback Position is inadequate condemnation of Schembri's unacceptable course of action.</P>
<P><BOLD>21.</BOLD> The Way Group submits further that the only adequate condemnation of Schembri's unacceptable course of action (in alleging fraud and advancing that allegation until responding oral submissions) is to dismiss Schembri's motion, so that the Main Action and the ROFR Action may proceed to be tried together (in accordance with the Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014) and afford Way the opportunity to obtain vindication.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The ROFR Clause is valid and enforceable</TI>
<P><BOLD>22.</BOLD> The Way Group reiterates their position that the ROFR Clause is valid and enforceable.</P>
<P><BOLD>23.</BOLD> The ROFR Clause is valid and enforceable as it merely makes clear that Schembri's statutory fiduciary duty (and that of Schembri Financial, a company he controls and is a 45% shareholder of Triumph) to <EM>&ldquo;act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of [Triumph]&rdquo;</EM> includes presenting to Triumph (and KFI, the 55% shareholder of Triumph) all real estate development opportunities which he (through Schembri Financial or otherwise) may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.</P>
<P><BOLD>24.</BOLD> It is not in dispute that Schembri complied initially with his statutory fiduciary duty in this regard. However, Schembri subsequently wilfully breached this fiduciary duty in March, 2009; almost one year before he commenced the Main Action.</P>
<P><BOLD>25.</BOLD> The Way Group submits that the ROFR Clause is not a restrictive covenant<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia Forest Products Limited v. Gay et ux.</SOC><CITE>1978 CarswellBC 116</CITE></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, and therefore the analysis and case law presented by Schembri is inapplicable.</P>
<P><BOLD>26.</BOLD> It is trite law that an alleged restrictive covenant is assessed using a four-stage inquiry as follows:
<P1>(a) Stage One&mdash;is the covenant under review in restraint of trade?;</P1>
<P1>(b) Stage Two&mdash;is the restraint one which is against public policy and, therefore, void?;</P1>
<P1>(c) Stage Three&mdash;can the restraint be justified as reasonable in the interest of the parties?; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Stage Four&mdash;can it be justified as reasonable with reference to the interests of the public?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tank Lining Corp. v. Dunlop Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1982 CarswellOnt 780</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>27.</BOLD> The standard of the assessment to be applied differs according to the contract at issue and the relative bargaining power of the parties to that contract. More specifically, the common law distinguishes between non-competition clauses found in employment agreements and those found elsewhere.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Stage One</TI>
<P><BOLD>28.</BOLD> The generally accepted definition of restraint on trade is as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>A contract in restraint of trade is one in which a party (the covenantor) agrees with any other party (the covenantee) to restrict his liberty in the future to carry on trade with other persons not parties to the contract in such a manner as he chooses</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Petrofina (Great Britain) Ltd. v. Martin</SOC><CITE>[1966] Ch. 146</CITE><PAGENUM>at p 180</PAGENUM></CASEREF> cited in <CASEREF><SOC>Stephens v. Gulf Oil Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1975 CarswellOnt 809</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>29.</BOLD> The ROFR Clause does not restrict Schembri (or Schembri Financial) from carrying on trade with other persons not a party to the Shareholder Agreement in such a manner as he chooses; rather, it imposes on Schembri (and Schembri Financial) a specific fiduciary duty to present real estate development opportunities in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo to Triumph (and KFI). The result being that Schembri (directly or indirectly) will have either:
<P1>(a) a 45% interest in the real estate development opportunity if Triumph (or KFI) indicates in writing within 15 days that it is taking on the real estate development opportunity; or</P1>
<P1>(b) a 100% interest in the real estate development opportunity if Triumph (and KFI) does not indicate in writing within 15 days that it is taking on the real estate development opportunity.</P1></P>
<P>Neither (a) nor (b) affects other persons not a party to the Shareholder Agreement.</P>
<P><BOLD>30.</BOLD> The Way Group submits that it is disingenuous and improper for Schembri, as a director and officer of Triumph, to assert that:
<P1>(a) he ought to be able to acquire a real estate development opportunity in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo;</P1>
<P1>(b) present it to Triumph (and KFI) as required by the ROFR Clause; and then</P1>
<P1>(c) subvert the ROFR Clause, and his fiduciary duty, by withholding his consent for Triumph to indicate in writing within 15 days that Triumph is taking on the real estate development opportunity.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Stage Two</TI>
<P><BOLD>31.</BOLD> The second stage of the inquiry assesses whether the restraint is against public policy as <EM>&ldquo;not every restraint of trade is void&rdquo;</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tank Lining Corp. v. Dunlop Industries Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>32.</BOLD> The Way Group submits that public policy has been expressed insections 1(1), 108(2), 115(1) and 134(1) and (2) of the <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM>. As a result, even if the ROFR Clause is found to be in restraint of trade, it is not against public policy; and, therefore, continues to be valid and enforceable.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Stages Three and Four</TI>
<P><BOLD>33.</BOLD> Only if the ROFR Clause is found to be a restrictive covenant (Stage 1) that is void against public policy (Stage 2), does the court then assess whether the ROFR Clause is justified as reasonable in the interests of:
<P1>(a) Way and Schembri, and their companies, KFI and Schembri Financial (Stage Three); and</P1>
<P1>(b) public policy (Stage Four).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>34.</BOLD> Often stages three and four are considered together.</P>
<P><BOLD>35.</BOLD> It is at stage three that the court considers:
<P1>(a) geographic coverage (i.e. spatial)</P1>
<P1>(b) duration (i.e. temporal); and</P1>
<P1>(c) extent of activity (i.e. scope).</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>36.</BOLD> Regarding geographic coverage, it is limited to the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.</P>
<P><BOLD>37.</BOLD> The &ldquo;Regional Municipality of Waterloo&rdquo; imposes clearly defined geographic limits that are set out in the <EM>Regional Municipality of Waterloo Act</EM> (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Act&rdquo;</BOLD>). Those geographic limits include:
<P1>(a) the City of Cambridge;</P1>
<P1>(b) the City of Kitchener;</P1>
<P1>(c) the City of Waterloo;</P1>
<P1>(d) the Township of North Dumfries;</P1>
<P1>(e) the Township of Wellesley;</P1>
<P1>(f) the Township of Wilmot; and</P1>
<P1>(g) the Township of Woolwich.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>38.</BOLD> The properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action are located in: (a) the City of Kitchener (i.e. 5 Rittenhouse); and (b) the City of Waterloo (i.e. 61 Columbia, 41 Columbia, 1 Columbia, 69 Columbia and 274 Larch). There is no ambiguity that these properties are within the Region of Waterloo, and the geographic limits overseen by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in accordance with the Act.</P>
<P><BOLD>39.</BOLD> Regarding duration, a distinction must be made between S [Missing text] Schembri.</P>
<P><BOLD>40.</BOLD> The ROFR Clause requires Schembri Financial:

<P><BOLD>41.</BOLD> Based on the evidence before the court on this motion, Schembri Financial has not acquired any real estate development opportunities within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. Regardless, if Schembri Financial wishes to be relieved of its' obligation to present real estate development opportunities it should take steps to cease being a shareholder of Triumph. Instead of doing so, Schembri Financial is taking steps in the Main Action to increase its' shareholding interest in Triumph from 45% to 55%.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Compendium of the Defendants, Amended Amended Statement of Claim, Tab E, page 495, subparagraph (k)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>42.</BOLD> Based on the evidence before the court on this motion, Schembri has acquired many real estate development opportunities within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, through other companies he controls<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Motion Record, Schembri May, 2017 Affidavit, Tab 2, page 12, paragraph 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. If Schembri wishes to be relieved of his fiduciary obligation to Triumph he should resign as an officer and director. Schembri has elected not to resign, and, as a result, he continues to owe a fiduciary duty to Triumph as mandated by the <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM> and specified by the ROFR Clause.</P>
<P><BOLD>43.</BOLD> Regarding extent of activity, the ROFR Clause requires Schembri Financial and Schembri:
<QUOTE><P><EM>to present to [KFI] and [Triumph] all real estate development opportunities (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) which it may have acquired within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo</EM><BOLD><EM>...[KFI] and [Triumph] shall have FIFTEEN (15) days following the presentation of the Project to them to determine if it is economically feasible using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances</EM>...</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>44.</BOLD> It is clear that the activity is:
<P1>(a) restricted to real estate development opportunities; and</P1>
<P1>(b) such opportunities are to be assessed <EM>&ldquo;using the typical budget model consistently utilized by them in such circumstances&rdquo;</EM>.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>45.</BOLD> Way and Schembri had a typical budget model that they used to determine economic feasibility of, among other opportunities, the Waterloo Lands, the London Lands and the Oshawa Lands<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Alven J.

<P><BOLD>46.</BOLD> More importantly, it hardly lies in Schembri's mouth to assert that a &ldquo;real estate opportunity&rdquo; that he had acquired was not &ldquo;economically feasible&rdquo;, after proceeding with multiple &ldquo;real estate opportunities]&rdquo; to the exclusion of Triumph (and KFI)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Volume 1, pages 105 to 110, paragraphs 380 to 400</P>

<P><BOLD>47.</BOLD> Finally, it is clear from the independent evidence of Frank Volpini (obtained by Schembri under oath and submitted to the court on this motion) that the ROFR Clause is justified as reasonable in the interests of Way and Schembri, and their companies (KFI and Schembri Financial).</P>
<P><BOLD>48.</BOLD> Counsel for Schembri examined Mr. Volpini under oath in connection with Schembri's motion to compel Way to guarantee construction financing for the development of the Oshawa Lands (which motion Justice Mesbur dismissed and awarded costs to Way).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Way Affidavit, RMR, Tab A, page 76, paragraphs 267 and 268</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. This factum is being filed with leave of the Court in reply to the Supplementary Factum of Way dated October 31, 2018, wherein he takes the position that Section 134 of the <EM>Business Corporations Act (&ldquo;OBCA&rdquo;)</EM>, prevents Schembri from conducting business independent of Triumph Financial. There is no evidentiary or legal basis for this position. A full and careful reading of the Statement of Claim clearly indicates that Way's claim is grounded on an alleged breach of the Non-Competition Clause. Way's action therefore stands or falls on the enforceability of the Non-Competition Clause in the Shareholder Agreement. If the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable, then the action fails.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Business Corporations Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c.B.16 (&ldquo;<EM>OBCA</EM>&rdquo;), Section 134; Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 2, at para. 66. Compendium filed by the Defendant/Moving Party (&ldquo;Compendium&rdquo;) at Tab E, pg. 487&ndash;581.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>2. While Schembri acknowledges the duty imposed by Section 134, he has not breached it and there is no evidence to suggest he has. Accordingly, Way's &ldquo;new&rdquo; argument does not change the result. The Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable and the action ought to be dismissed.</P>
<P>3. In any event, Schembri is only an officer and director of Triumph. Way and Kingsley Financial can have no Section 134 claim. The question is, does Triumph Financial have a Section 134 claim? It does not.</P>
<P>4. Section 134 imposes a duty on a director to act honestly and in good faith. It does not restrict a director's ability to earn a living independent of his role as director. At common law a director cannot misappropriate a &ldquo;mature&rdquo; or &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; business opportunity of the corporation. Schembri did not do that and there is no evidence that any of the properties he acquired constituted a mature or ripe business opportunity of Triumph Financial. Even on this new theory the action fails.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Way's filing of a Supplementary Factum</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The entire &ldquo;law portion&rdquo; of Schembri's Factum (being paragraphs 51&ndash;149), related to the legal arguments regarding the enforceability of the Non-Competition Clause. Way's first Factum ignored these legal issues raised and these issues still remain, by and large, unaddressed.</P>
<P>6. Way submits that the Supplementary Factum was <EM>requested</EM> by the Honourable Justice Sloan in his email of October 22, 2018. This is incorrect. Justice Sloan only sought Mr. Whiteley's <UNDER>confirmation or correction</UNDER> with respect to the fact that Way's Original Factum did not address the Non-Competition Clause:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Would Mr. Whitely please confirm or correct the following</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>3&mdash;Way's factum does not appear to address the issues raised by Schembri in paragraph 2 above</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>7. Justice Sloan was correct that Way's original Factum did not address Schembri's arguments as to why the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable. Justice Sloan has subsequently granted leave and accepted delivery of Way's Supplementary Factum.</P>
<P>8. Way also submits that his Supplementary Factum is necessary as a result of Schembri's withdrawal of allegations of fraud. This is a misstatement of what occurred. Schembri did not withdraw such allegations, rather he advised the Court that he would not rely on his &ldquo;fallback&rdquo; legal argument that the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable because of Way's repudiation of the Agreement by reason of his &ldquo;bad conduct&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Fallback Position&rdquo;). Schembri did this to ensure that the Motion could be heard in the 2 days allocated and agreed upon. The Fallback Position was addressed in a very minor fashion in Schembri's Factum (only 1 paragraph).</P>
<P>9. The allegations of fraud remain very much alive in the Main Action. To the extent that Mr. Whiteley wants to make submissions as to costs at the conclusion of the Motion, that does not require the delivery of a Supplementary Factum at this time.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>10. The only motion before This Honourable Court is Schembri's Motion seeking, <EM>inter alia</EM>, a declaration that the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable and of no force and effect, and granting summary judgment as a result thereof.</P>
<P>11. Way has attempted to hijack the Motion by seeking various relief not contemplated by the Parties when this Motion was timetabled by the Court on February 8, 2018.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn April 5, 2018, RMR, Tab A, at paras 38&ndash;68, 111;</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn April 5, 2018, RMR, Tab A, at paras 6&ndash;11, Exhibit 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Instead of responding to Schembri's Motion, Way decided to focus upon the relief that he had not properly sought from the Court. This is evident from:
<P1>a. Way's 10 volume, Responding Motion Record, which contains a 110 page, 404 paragraph affidavit, which appends 154 Exhibits, which does not address the enforceability of the Non-Competition Clause; and</P1>
<P1>b. Way's 63 page original Factum which does not respond to the Defendant's arguments.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Commencement of the Motion and Reason for the Withdrawal of the Fallback Position</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. The Motion was to commence on October 18, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Mr. Whiteley lost his car keys and was approximately 90 minutes late. Mr. Wortzman finished his oral argument in the one day that was allocated to him.</P>
<P>14. Mr. Whiteley's oral argument responded to the Fallback Position and little else.</P>
<P>15. Given that the time period for arguing the Motion (as agreed upon by the parties) was running out, and the disproportionate amount of time spent by Mr. Whiteley on the Fallback Position, Mr. Wortzman advised the Court that Schembri was prepared to withdraw the Fallback Position.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Schembri's Position at the Original Attendance</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. As was made clear to the Court at the return of the Motion and in written correspondence, it is Schembri's position that Way's ROFR Action stands or falls on the enforceability of the Non-Competition Clause and that the Non-Competition Clause is not valid or enforceable for the following seven reasons:
<P1>(a) It is contrary to public policy (paras. 51&ndash;55 of Schembri's Factum);</P1>
<P1>(b) Since it is ambiguous on its face and, Way cannot satisfy his onus of demonstrating the reasonableness of the clause in the face of such ambiguity (paras. 56-57 of Schembri's Factum);</P1>
<P1>(c) It is ambiguous in relation to geographical location, development opportunities acquired and the absence of a typical budget model (paras. 58&ndash;77 of Schembri's Factum);</P1>
<P1>(d) If the Court finds that the said Clause is not contrary to public policy and is not ambiguous, then it is unenforceable because it is merely an agreement to agree, (paras. 78&ndash;90 of Schembri's Factum);</P1>
<P1>(e) If the Court finds that the said Clause is not contrary to public policy, is not ambiguous, and is not merely not an agreement to agree, then the Clause is enforceable because it is unreasonable on its face with respect to geographic scope, temporal limits and activities prohibited (paras. 91&ndash;108 of Schembri's Factum);</P1>
<P1>(f) If the Court finds that the said Clause is not contrary to public interest, is not ambiguous, is not an agreement to agree, and is not unreasonable, then the Clause is unenforceable because it is not necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial (paras. 109&ndash;120 of Schembri's Factum); and</P1>
<P1>(g) From a practical point of view, the said Clause is unworkable and of no force or effect.</P1></P>
<P>17. None of these issues were addressed in Way's original Factum. Schembri will not re-visit those submissions herein.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Way's New Issue&mdash;Section 134</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. The within factum assumes that the Non-Competition Clause is unenforceable for the reasons stated in paragraph 16 herein. Accordingly, this Factum addresses Way's argument that even if the said Clause is unenforceable, Schembri is precluded from doing business (outside of the business contemplated by the Shareholder Agreement) as a result of a Section 134 statutory duty.</P>
<P>19. Way's position is not supported by the evidence or the law and is commercially unreasonable.</P>
<P>20. Way has no claim arising from the alleged breach of the Non-Competition Clause since he is not a party to it. Kingsley Financial (Schembri is not an officer or director of Kingsley Financial) and Way (who is not a corporation) can have no claim arising out of a breach of Section 134 as a matter of law. Therefore the only question is whether Triumph Financial has a claim grounded on the theory that Section 134 prohibited Schembri from conducting business independent of Triumph Financial.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES, LAW &amp; AUTHORITIES</TI>
<P>21. This Reply Factum addresses the following issues raised in Way's Responding Factum:
<P1>a) Did Schembri breach any fiduciary duty owed to Triumph Financial?</P1>
<P1>b) What are the consequences (if any) of Schembri withdrawing his Fallback Position?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>No Breach of Fiduciary Duty</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. A review of the jurisprudence with respect to a director's breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the corporation highlight various principles applicable to the relationship between Schembri and Triumph Financial. In summary a director cannot misappropriate a mature or ripe corporate opportunity without breaching his Section 134 duty:
<P1>(a) Directors of a corporation <EM>are precluded by their fiduciary duty from obtaining, for themselves, &ldquo;either secretly or without approval of the company, any property or business advantage</EM> <UNDER><EM>either belonging to the company or for which it has been negotiating</EM></UNDER>, <EM>and especially is this so where the director or officer is a participant in the negotiations on behalf of the company.&rdquo;;</EM>

<P1>(c) A mere idea is not a business opportunity. It is a &ldquo;maturing&rdquo; or &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; business opportunity, immediately available to the corporation that constitutes a business advantage or opportunity that the fiduciary may not appropriate to himself;
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Tracey v. Tracey</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 3144</CITE><PARANUM>56</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>DSBA at Tab 1;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Donor Gateway Inc. v. Passero</SOC><CITE>2007 CanLII 3677</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>DSBA at Tab 4.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>(d) A &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; business opportunity has been described by the Court as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>By &ldquo;ripe&rdquo;, I understand the case law to mean that the opportunity available to the corporation is a prize ready for immediate grasping&mdash;not a general course of future conduct which is merely being explored</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>23. Schembri acknowledges that directors owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation for which they serve. The new issue before this Court is whether the conduct of Schembri contravened such duty owed to Triumph Financial. Put another way, did Schembri's development of real estate contravene his Section 134 duty to Triumph Financial. It did not, because such developments did not &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to Triumph Financial and did not constitute a maturing business opportunity of Triumph Financial. Section 134 does not prevent a director from conducting business outside the Corporation without more. The &ldquo;more&rdquo; is evidence of dishonesty or bad faith. There is none here.</P>
<P>24. It is clear from these principles that Schembri did not breach his Section 134 duties owed to Triumph Financial. There is no general prohibition on directors from having other business interests. Way has developed numerous properties since the action was commenced. By so doing, he has not breached his Section 134 duty owed to Triumph Financial. That is because such development opportunities were not ripe or mature opportunities of Triumph Financial. Way is legally entitled to pursue other business opportunities. So is Schembri. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Schembri did not Usurp any Maturing Opportunities</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. Despite Way's lengthy affidavit (110 pages with 154 exhibits), there is no evidence whatsoever before This Honourable Court that Schembri usurped for himself or for another person or company <BOLD><EM>a maturing business opportunity</EM></BOLD> of Triumph Financial. This is because it never happened. In the absence of such evidence there can be no breach of any duty.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of A. Way sworn March 16, 2018, PMR, Tab A</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><TI>The Oshawa, London and Waterloo Properties</TI>
<P>26. The parties to the Shareholder Agreement agreed that the Non-Competition Clause would govern the development of only the Oshawa, Waterloo, and London Properties. In this regard, the Oshawa, Waterloo, and London Properties can be seen as the only <EM>maturing</EM> or <EM>ripe</EM> business opportunities of the corporation.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of G. Schembri dated April 2, 2018, at p. 1759, q. 6819, Compendium at Tab D, pg. 313.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Those <EM>ripe</EM> business opportunities were sold pursuant to a consent Sales Process Order during a Commercial Court supervised liquidation of Triumph Financial's assets. The Waterloo and London Properties were sold to Schembri corporations. The Oshawa Property was sold to a Way company. Particulars of the Sales Process Order are included at paragraphs 121&ndash;138 of Schembri's original Factum. Vesting Orders were made. Acquisitions of these properties by Way and Schembri which were sanctioned by Court orders (that were not appealed) cannot constitute a breach of any Section 134 duties. Way's acquisition of the Oshawa Property and Schembri's acquisition of the Waterloo and London Properties could not constitute any breach of Section 134 duties.

<P>28. Schembri did not usurp any maturing business opportunity of Triumph with respect to any properties. Any claim that he did is without evidentiary foundation and constitutes a collateral attack on the Order of the Court of Appeal and the Vesting Orders.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>61 Columbia Street</TI>
<P>29. The only potential <EM>maturing</EM> or <EM>ripe</EM> business opportunity is with respect to the property known as 61 Columbia Street.</P>
<P>30. As particularized at paragraphs 139&ndash;143 of Schembri's Factum, the evidence before this Honourable Court is clear that any claim is statute barred and that it was in fact Triumph Financial that entered into the Agreement of Purchase and Sale for 61 Columbia Street. Schembri asked Way to use Triumph Financial as purchaser in an effort to disguise him as the real purchaser from the vendor in an attempt to keep the acquisition costs down. Way did so. Way had no interest in developing 61 Columbia Street, and accordingly he assigned the said Agreement of Purchase and Sale from Triumph Financial to one of Schembri's corporate entities which purchased 61 Columbia Street. 61 Columbia Street was pursued by Schembri with informed consent and not in breach of any Section 134 duty.

<BLOCK4><TI>Article 22 of the Shareholder Agreement Expressly Permits Way and Schembri to Conduct Other Business</TI>
<P>31. Additionally, it is important to note that the Shareholder Agreement, at Article 22, is clear that the agreement as between the parties would not create any partnership whatsoever. In this regard, Article 22 of the Shareholder Agreement stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any way or for any purpose to constitute any party a partner of any other party to this Agreement in the conduct of any business or otherwise, or a member of a joint venture or joint enterprise with any other party to this Agreement</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of A. Way sworn March 16, 2018, PMR, Tab A, at para 145, Exhibit 54; Compendium at Tab A, pg. 11&ndash;36.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. This is consistent with Schembri's evidence that the Shareholder Agreement was only to apply to the Oshawa, Waterloo and London Properties (being the projects contemplated by the parties at the time that the Shareholder Agreement was entered into).
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of G. Schembri dated April 2, 2018 at p.1759, q.6819, Compendium at Tab D, pg.313.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. Article 22 clearly indicates that it was the parties' intentions and express agreement that both Way and Schembri could pursue other business interests. By so doing they cannot be in breach of any Section 134 duties.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Why Section 134 Cannot Apply</UNDER></TI>
<P>34. The evidence before This Honourable Court is also clear that:
<P1>(a) Triumph Financial has not carried on any business whatsoever since the Receiver was appointed over all of its assets in September of 2010. It is defunct, has no employees, and is not active; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The reality is that Triumph Financial had no &ldquo;maturing&rdquo; or &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; business opportunities since 2010 and has not even been engaged in the business of real estate development since 2010.
<P2><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1 at para 79; Transcript from the Cross-Examination of A. Way dated July 17, 2018, pp. 24-25, qq.25&ndash;31, pp.32&ndash;33, qq 69-70.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>35. Triumph Financial seeks the benefit of all of Schembri's hard work over the last 8 years without having carried on business, invested any capital, taken any risks, or performed any services.</P>
<P>36. Schembri is entitled to use the skills, talent, and knowledge that he brought into the Shareholder Agreement with Way, and following a complete breakdown of their relationship, to earn a living for him and his family.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Donor Gateway Inc. v. Passero</SOC><CITE>2007 CanLII 3677</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>DSBA at Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. It is commercially unreasonable to maintain that Schembri is unable to pursue any real estate development opportunities, on the sole basis that he is a director of Triumph Financial. There is no legal rationale let alone evidence to support such a principle.</P>
<P>38. To interpret Section 134 as Way seeks to interpret it, being that a director cannot conduct business independent of a corporation, would create significant new law, impose an impossible and unacceptable burden on directors, and cause considerable upheaval and confusion within corporate law. It would also create havoc in that business people would no longer be willing to act as directors of corporations for the fear that the Section 134 duty owed to the corporation would bar them from acting independently of the corporation to secure new business opportunities. Clearly, this is not the meaning of or the intention of Section 134 of the <EM>OBCA</EM>.</P>
<P>39. In any event, the Non-Competition Clause purports to bind Schembri as a &ldquo;shareholder&rdquo; of Triumph Financial not as a director of Triumph Financial. Shareholders owe no fiduciary duty to the corporation. There is no evidence that Schembri breached his Section 134 duty because he never acted dishonestly or contrary to the best interests of Triumph Financial. In fact, Justice Roberts found it was in Triumph Financial's best interests for a Receiver to be appointed.
<P1><BOLD>Schembri Affidavit sworn May 17, 2017, DMR, Tab 1 at para 35; Endorsement of Justice Roberts dated September 24, 2010 at para 5, Compendium at Tab B, pg. 105&ndash;112.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Way Misinterprets the Non-Competition Clause</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>Stage One</TI>
<P>40. Way states that the Non-Competition Clause imposes on Schembri a specific fiduciary duty to present real estate opportunities (Way's Supplementary Factum at paragraph 29). This is not so and it begs the question as to the Non-Competition Clause's enforceability. The Non-competition Clause is merely a contractual term in a Shareholders Agreement. Whether the Non-Competition Clause is enforceable or not is a matter of contract law. The Non-Competition Clause cannot and does not impose a fiduciary duty on Schembri. It imposes a contractual obligation if and only if the Non-Competition Clause is enforceable. It is not.</P>
<P>41. Way says that the Non-Competition Clause affects no persons not a party to the Shareholder Agreement (Way's Supplementary Factum at paragraph 29). This is not so. It effects any entity with which Schembri is directly or indirectly related (including public companies) and Schembri's offspring, and his offspring's offspring and so on.</P>
<P>42. Way says that it is improper for Schembri to withhold his consent to Triumph Financial taking on a real estate opportunity (Way's Supplementary Factum at paragraph 30(c)). This is not so. The Shareholders Agreement specifically and expressly requires both of Schembri's and Way's consent for Triumph Financial to take on any real estate opportunity:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The parties hereto agree:</EM></P>
<P><EM>(c) That during the currency of this Agreement, the parties agree that without the consent of the shareholders representing not less than ONE HUNDRED (100%) per cent of the voting shares of the capital stock of the Corporation:</EM></P>
<P><EM>(xiv) the Corporation shall not commit to any financing arrangements with third parties;</EM></P>
<P><EM>(xv) no projects will be undertaken or initiated by the Corporation without project feasibility studies and construction budget approvals</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of A. Way sworn March 16, 2018, PMR, Tab A, at para 145, Exhibit 54; Compendium at Tab A, pg. 11&ndash;36.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. It also makes no commercial sense for Schembri or Way to be forced to do future deals with each other if they choose not to do so based on the express provision in the Shareholder Agreement.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>Stage Two</TI>
<P>44. This was addressed in Schembri's original Factum. The Non-Competition Clause is contrary to public policy.</P>
<P>[Missing text]</P>
<P>support that proposition. Firstly, Way personally does not receive the benefit of the Non-Competition Clause, only Triumph Financial and Kingsley Financial do. Secondly, Way left out a significant portion of Volpini's evidence that immediately preceded the passage he quoted:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Q.43.</BOLD> <EM>&ldquo;All right. Do you recall any discussion that if Mr. Way didn't agree to a 50/50 shareholder split in the event that the corporation was self-financing, then Mr. Schembri could just say no more developments?&rdquo;</EM></P>
<P><BOLD>A.</BOLD> <EM>&ldquo;Yes. The two of them could say that at any time.&rdquo;</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript from the Examination of Frank Volpini, dated February 14, 2011, q.43, pg. 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>49. This is completely consistent with Schembri's evidence that both he and Way must agree on the terms of any future development or they could walk away. It is also completely consistent with commercial reality and common sense. Unless the parties come to an agreement on many issues, no future development could proceed or be possible. It is also completely consistent with the only commercially reasonable manner in which the Non-Competition Clause can be construed.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Consequences of Withdrawing the Fraud Allegations</UNDER></TI>
<P>50. The Fallback Position was withdrawn by Schembri in an effort to expedite the hearing of the within Motion. It is Schembri's main position that the Non-Competition Clause is void, because it is against public policy, ambiguous, unreasonable, and impractical. The allegations of fraud were for the purposes of providing necessary background facts to explain why Schembri terminated his relationship with Way and why a Receiver had to be appointed.</P>
<P>51. Way argues that the &ldquo;<EM>only adequate condemnation of Schembri's unacceptable course of action (in alleging fraud and advancing that allegation into responding oral submissions) is to dismiss Schembri's motion, so that the Main Action and the ROFR Action may proceed to be tried together and afford Way the opportunity to obtain vindication</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>52. There is no reason let alone need to &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; Schembri's decision to withdraw a single fallback legal argument. The Non-Competition Clause is enforceable or not. Schembri's withdrawal of a position was intended to facilitate and expedite the hearing of the motion. Such decisions ought to be commended not condemned by the Court.</P>
<P>53. This is merely an attempt by Way to avoid an interpretation of the Non-Competition Clause by This Court and to prolong the ROFR Action.</P>
<P>54. Despite the fact that the Fallback Position has now been withdrawn with respect to the Summary Judgment Motion, the issue of fraud will be squarely before the trier of fact in the Trial of the Main Action (and the Trial of this Action, if it proceeds). At either Trial, Way will have the opportunity to seek <EM>vindication</EM> for himself and to address any allegations of fraud made against him by Schembri and as has already been found by the Courts. This is not a reason to dismiss Schembri's Motion.</P>
<P>55. To the extent that Way wishes to argue that the withdrawal of the Fallback Position has resulted in wasted costs with respect to the Motion, he can do so. The proper time and forum for that argument is after a decision is rendered in the Summary Judgment Motion and when the parties make their costs submissions.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<FREEFORM>
<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> The Defendants (collectively, <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;)</BOLD> seek costs in the amount of $499,933.06 on a partial indemnity basis.</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> The Plaintiffs (collectively, <BOLD>&ldquo;Way&rdquo;)</BOLD> submit that the amount sought is grossly excessive as it is based on, among other things: (a) an arbitrary approach in determining the time spent (as well as disbursements incurred) and applying greater than maximum rates, without providing any dockets or invoices; and (b) is inconsistent with section 131(1) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> (the <BOLD>&ldquo;CJA&rdquo;)</BOLD> and the factors contained in Rule 57.01. Put simply, the amount sought is unfair, unreasonable, disproportionate and ignores Schembri's allegations of fraud withdrawn, without notice, while Way's counsel was in the midst of oral submissions (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Withdrawn Fraud Allegations&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Arbitrary Approach to Determining Time Spent (and Disbursements)</TI>
<P><BOLD>3.</BOLD> Schembri seeks costs based on 1296.8 hours (as summarized in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; hereto) having been spent &ldquo;in relation to the ROFR Action&rdquo; with certain items being &ldquo;shared 50%&mdash;50% with the Main Action&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Defendants' Cost Submissions, paragraph 19 and Tab A, Costs Outline</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. Such shared items (Second and Third Fee Items) total 959.3 hours, and represent 74% of the total hours certified.</P>
<P><BOLD>4.</BOLD> A 50/50 split with respect to the Second and Third Fee Items is arbitrary and inconsistent with: (a) the number of disputes in the litigation between Way and Schembri: and (b) the time spent at the examinations for discovery of Way (and Schembri conducted to date) regarding these disputes.</P>
<P><BOLD>5.</BOLD> Regarding (a) in paragraph 4 above, there are seven disputes; six in the Main Action and one in the ROFR Action<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Responding Factum of Way, pp. 8 and 9, paras 14 and 15</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. As such, there is limited impact on the litigation between the parties. Moreover, the &ldquo;further productions&rdquo; Schembri has now avoided producing had been required to be disclosed by Schembri under Rule 30 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</P>
<P><BOLD>6.</BOLD> Regarding (b) in paragraph 4 above, Way was examined for thirteen days and gave approximately 600 undertakings. A review of the transcripts and related &lsquo;Undertakings and Refusals Charts&rsquo; reveal that Schembri's counsel spent little time on the ROFR Action (at times during Day 11 and 13) with few undertakings given. This was also the situation at the five days of re -attendance arising from answers to undertakings. In contrast, the majority of time spent and undertakings given related to a single dispute in the Main Action (namely, the &lsquo;JV Accounting Dispute&rsquo;).</P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> The situation described in the paragraph 6 above is similar for the examinations for discovery of Schembri conducted to date.</P>
<P><BOLD>8.</BOLD> Regarding the Second Fee Item totaling 402.1 hours, included therein is 69.5 hours for Mr. Kulathungam. To Way's knowledge, Mr. Kulathungam's involvement has been limited to &lsquo;Fee items&rsquo; in respect of which the court received submissions and awarded costs that footnote 1 in the Costs Outline states has &ldquo;been deducted and not included&rdquo;. If so, this means that Mr. Kulathungam has purportedly spent at least 240 hours on the litigation between Way and Schembri<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>69.5 hours x 2 (based on the 50/50 split) plus 101.7 hours (based on Schembri's Summary of Costs submitted in connection with the Cost Endorsement of Mr. Justice Sloan dated January 30, 2017 (Appendix A) and aggregated in Tab B to the Cost Submissions of Way (Appendix B))</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. That cannot be 4 correct. There appears to be significant double-counting.</P>
<P><BOLD>9.</BOLD> Further, the Second Fee Item references &ldquo;Motion preparation and Court Attendances&rdquo; without particularizing such motions and attendances. Way is not aware of any prior motions where costs of such motions were ordered reserved to the trial judge<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>There is an order in the Receivership Proceedings made &ldquo;without prejudice to the rights of [Way and Schembri] to ultimately argue who or what should be responsible for the cost of the Receivership&rdquo; (Responding Motion Record, Volume 9, Tab 119, Exhibit &ldquo;119&rdquo;)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, which is consistent with the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; scheme under the current costs regime in place since 2009.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Hession v. Black Construction Services Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7047</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> (Appendix C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Moreover, &ldquo;when a matter is disposed of on a motion...with no mention of costs, it is as though the judge had said that he &lsquo;saw fit to make no order as to costs.&rsquo;&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mark M. Orkin, <EM>The Law of Costs</EM> (Canada Law Books: 2001) at pp. 1 to 15 (Appendix D)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> Consequently, the time spent in respect of the Second and Third Fee Items and the disbursements in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the Costs Outline are overstated significantly.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Greater Than Maximum Rates</TI>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> The Costs Sub-Committee of the Civil Rules Committee published an Information Notice in July of 2005 which provides some guidance as to maximum partial indemnity rates. The rates are shown in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; hereto.</P>
<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> Not only will courts treat the rates shown in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; as maximum rates, [i]t is further anticipated that the maximum rates would apply only to the more complicated matters and to the more experienced counsel within each category.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Watson &amp; McGowan's Ontario Civil Practice</EM> (Thomson Reuters; 2019) at p. 1248 (Appendix E)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<BLOCK2><TI>Section 131(1) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM></TI>
<P><BOLD>16.</BOLD> Section 131 of the CJA states:

<P><BOLD>17.</BOLD> The Court of Appeal has interpreted this section to mean that:
<QUOTE><P><EM>the court hearing a proceeding or a step in a proceeding will fix those costs. The use of the definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; as opposed to the indefinite article &ldquo;a&rdquo; reinforces that implication. This implies that the court hearing the appeal should decide the costs of the appeal. Nothing in the CPA suggests the contrary</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Society of Essex v.

<P><BOLD>18.</BOLD> Accordingly, this court does not have jurisdiction to fix or award costs in a matter that is not before it. There is a significant risk that the court will do so if it accepts Schembri's arbitrary 50/50 split with the Main Action.</P>
<P><BOLD>19.</BOLD> Given the foregoing, Schembri's partial indemnity costs without considering the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations ought to be less than $100,000.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Withdrawn Fraud Allegations</TI>
<P><BOLD>20.</BOLD> Schembri alleged fraud and other &ldquo;bad behaviour&rdquo; by Way in the Notice of Motion and the supporting affidavit causing Way to respond vigourously in his affidavit. In his reply affidavit, Schembri reiterated his allegation that Way defrauded him. During cross-examination, Schembri's counsel made it clear that Schembri was seeking from this court a finding of fraud by Way. Schembri then reiterated his allegations of fraud in his factum. Finally, Schembri's counsel made submissions before the court in support of Schembri's allegations of fraud.</P>
<P><BOLD>21.</BOLD> It was only when Way's counsel was about to continue addressing the allegations of fraud following the afternoon break, that Schembri's counsel announced, without prior notice, the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations.</P>
<P><BOLD>22.</BOLD> Given the Withdrawn Fraud Allegations, it is clear that Schembri was not entirely successful on the motion.</P>

<FREEFORM>
<P>1. While Way submits that Schembri's Cost Submissions are &ldquo;grossly excessive,&rdquo; &ldquo;unfair,&rdquo; &ldquo;unreasonable,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsubstantiated,&rdquo; he has not produced his own Cost Outline or any other documentation whatsoever which supports that position. An adverse inference ought to be drawn that Way incurred as much or more in costs (he had 3 gowned lawyers at the Motion).</P>
<P>2. Way submits that the costs sought by Schembri are &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; and &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo;. Yet, Way was seeking $30,500,000.00 against Schembri based upon serious allegations of conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy. Essentially, Way tried to turn the tables against Schembri by utilizing the strategy &ldquo;<EM>the best defence is a good offence</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Similar conduct by Way has been previously identified by Justice Sloan in his Endorsement dated December 23, 2016 at para 58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Way's decision was costly and ultimately unsuccessful. Way ought to pay the price.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Schembri's Approach is Not Arbitrary</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. Since the Actions were Ordered Tried together with common discoveries by Justice Broad on September 4, 2014, the costs incurred have related to the matters at issue in both Actions. It is impossible to divide such costs with precision. Way accuses Schembri of being arbitrary in calculating costs yet he has not provided the Court with any assistance or alternative method to do so. The issues in the Main Action regarding Way's &ldquo;bad&rdquo; conduct were all relevant to the enforceability of the Non-Competition Clause.</P>
<P>4. Way submits that the costs &ldquo;<EM>ought to be less than $100,000</EM>&rdquo; without providing any rationale (This submission is without merit as Justice Sloan awarded over $94,000 in costs against Way on an undertakings motion). The &ldquo;<EM>50/50 split</EM>&rdquo; for post September 2014 work as proposed by Schembri is the most efficient, fair and reasonable way to apportion the costs of Schembri and Way's competing claims and to indemnify Schembri for his costs of the unmeritorious litigation pursued by Way.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Cost Calculations are Accurate</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. At paragraph 8, Way submits that it cannot be correct that Mr. Kulathungam has spent &ldquo;<EM>at least 240 hours on the litigation between Way and Schembri</EM>&rdquo;. The time set out in Schembri's Cost Outline was carefully calculated. Mr. Kulathungam worked 240.6 hours on this Action over the last 5 years. Schembri seeks no costs that were subject to the Cost Endorsement of Justice Sloan dated January 30, 2017. There is no duplication.</P>
<P>6. At paragraph 9, Way submits that he is not aware of any prior motions where costs were ordered reserved. This is inaccurate. The parties attended at a Motion for Directions before Justice Sloan on February 8, 2018. The motion was resolved on consent and Justice Sloan's Endorsement specifically provided that costs would be in the cause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement of Justice Sloan dated February 8, 2018 appending the executed Consent. See paragraph 11 <BOLD>(Tab 1)</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These costs are now payable to Schembri.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Lawyer Rates are Reasonable</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Way wrongly states the maximum rates that apply to counsel fees. Way cites commentary from Watson &amp; McGowan's Ontario Civil Practice (&ldquo;Commentary&rdquo;) for that proposition.</P>
<P>8. The Commentary expressly states that it is &ldquo;<EM>anticipated</EM>&rdquo; that in considering rates &ldquo;<EM>courts will normally treat the rates as maximum rates</EM>&rdquo; Professor Watson was incorrect. The cost grid was abolished in 2005. The case produced by Way confirms the fact that the <UNDER>guidelines are not mandatory and are outdated</UNDER>. In this regard, in <EM>First Capital</EM>, Justice R. Smith approved hourly rates in excess of those included in the guidelines stating as follows, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) <EM>The maximum hourly rates . . .</EM> <UNDER><EM>are intended to provide guidance and are not mandatory</EM></UNDER>;</P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>The</EM> <UNDER><EM>amount involved in the dispute was substantial</EM></UNDER> <EM>as the matter involved a commercial dispute related to a shopping centre with</EM> <UNDER><EM>31 million dollars</EM></UNDER>;</P1>
<P1>(c) <UNDER><EM>Both parties retained well respected Toronto firms</EM></UNDER> <EM>where hourly rates and office overhead costs are higher than the provincial average. I also infer that both parties would be incurring similar full indemnity costs and</EM> <UNDER><EM>their reasonable expectations of the unsuccessful party would be to partial indemnity costs in excess of the maximum</EM></UNDER>...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>First Capital (Canholdings) Corp. v. North American Property Group</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 1359</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>First Capital</EM>&rdquo;) at Paras 13&ndash;16, <BOLD>Appendix F</BOLD> to Way's Responding Cost Submissions [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>9. The amount at issue in the ROFR Action was $30,500,000.00. Way and Schembri retained well respected Toronto firms.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mr. Whiteley was formerly a Partner of Gowlings LLP who had or assisted with carriage of this matter.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Way has two law firms acting on his behalf and had three gowned lawyers attending at the Motion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mr. Whiteley and Laughlin J. Campbell and Trevor Moum of Campbell Bader LLP attended on behalf of Way.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Way did not produce a Cost Outline to assist the Court in determining the reasonableness of the rates claimed by Schembri's counsel. In the circumstances, it is apparent that (1) Way knew (or reasonably ought to have known) that if unsuccessful in the ROFR Action, he would be ordered to pay Schembri's partial indemnity costs in the amount sought,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>First Capital</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 14-15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and (2) that if Way's counsel had prepared a Cost Outline, it would have not been of any assistance to him.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>No Dockets or Invoices Provided</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. Rule 57.01 (7) mandates that the Court &ldquo;<EM>shall</EM>&rdquo; adopt the simplest, least expensive and most expeditious process for fixing costs after receiving written submissions. Rule 57.01(6) requires that a party seeking its costs of a proceeding &ldquo;<EM>shall</EM>&rdquo; submit a Cost Outline identifying the costs sought, the work performed, and the hourly rate to be applied to each counsel for whom fees are requested. Schembri has complied with these Rules.</P>
<P>11. Way complains that time dockets and invoices were not provided. The Rule does not require this. Since Way has failed to provide any information regarding his costs, his position should be seen for what it is&mdash;nothing more than &ldquo;<EM>an attack in the air</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Higgins Cohn Brand Management v. Kinnikinnick Foods Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 2701</CITE><PARANUM>38&ndash;40</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>(Tab 2)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Withdrawal of Allegations Mischaracterized</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. It was Schembri's primary position at the Motion that the Non-Competition Clause was void as a matter of law (&ldquo;Primary Position&rdquo;). Schembri's fallback position was that the Non-Competition Clause should not be enforced by Way given his &ldquo;bad&rdquo; conduct (&ldquo;Fallback Position&rdquo;).</P>
<P>13. Way wrongly says that Schembri withdrew fraud allegations. Schembri's allegations of fraud and bad behaviour were not withdrawn, rather the legal Fallback Position was withdrawn. Had Schembri been unsuccessful at the Motion, the allegations of Way's bad behaviour would have been pursued at Trial. These allegations will also be front and center at the Trial of the Main Action. Way will have his chance to seek vindication if the allegations are not proven.</P>
<P>14. Schembri's withdrawal of the Fallback Position at the Motion was intended to facilitate and expedite the hearing of the Motion. Such decisions ought to be commended not condemned by the Court. In any event, given Justice Sloan's decision, the Fallback Position would not have been even necessary to argue because Schembri was entirely successful at the Motion on his Primary Position. The withdrawal therefore saved everyone time and money.</P>
<P>15. Way submits that Schembri's withdrawal of the Fallback Position requires &ldquo;<EM>serious cost consequences</EM>.&rdquo; Each of the cases relied upon by Way are not applicable because the Court grappled with the issue of whether or not costs should be awarded on a substantial indemnity where a party withdrew or was unsuccessful in their claim for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, unlawful conduct, and inducing breach of contract.</P>
<P>16. Schembri withdrew the Fallback Position (being a legal position) for the purposes of the Motion only. This does not attract cost consequences. Way, on the other hand, pursued the ROFR Action for over 6 years alleging that Schembri committed <UNDER>conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty, and conspiracy</UNDER>. Those allegations were unfounded and have been determined to be <UNDER>unmeritorious</UNDER> by Justice Sloan. Although he could have, Schembri did not seek his costs on a substantial indemnity basis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Future Health Inc. (Trustee of) v. General Accident</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4834</CITE><PARANUM>9&ndash;12</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appendix I</BOLD> to Way's Responding Cost Submissions.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such an award remains in the discretion of the Court.</P>
<P>17. Way has produced no authority that there should be &ldquo;<EM>serious cost consequences</EM>&rdquo; because Schembri withdrew a legal position, that in the end, would have been moot given the Courts decision on Schembri's Primary Position.</P>

<FREEFORM>
<P>1. The within action (the &ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;) is a companion action to Court File No. C-42-11 wherein Schembri sued Way for fraud (the &ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reference to &ldquo;Schembri&rdquo; and &ldquo;Way&rdquo; include reference to the various relevant corporations that the parties control.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In response to the Main Action, Way commenced the ROFR Action seeking to enforce a non-competition clause. <UNDER>Way sought damages from Schembri in the amount of $30,500,000.00</UNDER> based upon allegations of breach of contract, and intentional torts of conversion, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy.</P>
<P>2. The Actions were ordered to be tried together by Justice Broad.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order of the Honourable Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 <BOLD>(Tab 1)</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The actions are complex and the issues interwoven. There has been 36.5 days of examinations in the Actions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Not including the examinations for discovery conducted with respect to the Defendants Faye Patterson and the Way Family Trust.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. This summary judgment motion (&ldquo;Motion&rdquo;) was heard over four days. Schembri was entirely successful in having Way's $30,500,000.00 claim dismissed. Costs of the entire ROFR Action should follow the event. Schembri seeks the sum of $411,180.00 for fees, $53,453.40 for H.S.T., and $31,299.66 for disbursements, for a total of $499,933.06 with respect to the dismissal of the ROFR Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mo v.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Rule 57.01(1)&mdash;The Factors</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. Section 131 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> gives the Court broad discretion to award costs. This discretion is informed by the factors in Rule 57.01(1).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, RSO 1990, cC43, s. 131; <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg 194., R.57.01(1).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Schembri's costs are fair, reasonable and proportionate in light of these factors, and in particular, the principle of indemnity, what the unsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay, the amount claimed; the complexity of the proceeding; the importance of the issues, conduct tending to lengthen the proceeding unnecessarily, and the fact that Way made serious allegations of illegal conduct against Schembri, including allegations of conversion, misappropriation and conspiracy.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Amount and Importance of the Issue</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The issue raised at the motion was of critical importance to Schembri. Way sought over $30,500,000.00 in damages. Way's position in the ROFR Action was that he was entitled to participate with Schembri on all real estate developments in &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo; forever and on an undetermined and undefined basis. Way sought an interest in properties Schembri had developed over 10 years. Not only was Schembri facing a claim of $30,500,000.00 in damages, his business interests were at considerable risk over the past 10 years and forever thereafter.</P>
<P>6. In addition to the quantum of the damages sought in the ROFR Action and its impact on Schembri's continuing business endeavours and upon his family, the summary dismissal of the ROFR Action is also important as it will lead to the Main Action's more orderly resolution and to judicial efficacy.</P>
<P>7. The ROFR Action's dismissal is one step towards ending the <EM>war</EM> between the parties and:
<P1>(a) Will allow the parties to focus on moving the Main Action towards Trial;</P1>
<P1>(b) Will streamline the issues that require adjudication;</P1>
<P1>(c) Has alleviated the necessity of countless further productions and days of examinations; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Limits the need for further Court intervention. As set out above, there was already 36.5 days of examinations between Schembri and Way. This took place over nearly 4 years and required significant Court intervention.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Complexity of the Issue/ The Parties' Conduct</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. While the issue advanced by Schembri was narrow, Way expanded them. The allegations in the ROFR Action were serious, widespread and complex. Way sought $30,500,000.00 in damages arising from the profits related to Schembri's development of 26 properties. In defence of the ROFR Action, Schembri had to rely on Way's &ldquo;bad conduct&rdquo; which meant that the issues in the Main Action were inextricably intertwined with the ROFR Action.</P>
<P>9. Despite the significance of the claim amount and the fact that the ROFR Action was with respect to, <EM>inter alia</EM>, 26 properties, the main issue at the motion &ldquo;<EM>boil[ed] down to the contractual interpretation of Clause 13 of the Shareholders Agreement</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Sloan dated February 1, 2019 at para 101.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Schembri's position on the Motion was thorough, detailed and focused on the law surrounding restrictive covenants and its application to the facts of this case. Way's conduct, on the other hand, unnecessarily lengthened the proceeding and added significantly to the costs of the Motion. This ought to be considered in addressing the appropriate quantum of costs.</P>
<P>11. In compliance with his obligation to &ldquo;<EM>lead trump or risk losing</EM>&rdquo; on the Motion, Schembri filed a succinct Motion Record that focused on the application of Clause 13 of the Shareholders Agreement. Way, on the other hand, served a 10-volume Responding Motion Record that included a 111 page, 404 paragraph affidavit, and which appended 154 exhibits. Way's Responding Record did not respond to Schembri's position on the Motion (with less than 15% of the 404 paragraphs related to the Motion). Rather, Way, through an affidavit (with no Notice of Motion), sought significant relief (some of which related to the Main Action) that was not contemplated when the Motion was scheduled, raised irrelevant matters and unduly complicated and lengthened the hearing. Schembri had no option but to prepare substantive responding materials given Way's insistence on pursuing such relief.</P>
<P>12. Schembri served a factum in compliance with the Rules that focused squarely on the enforceability of Clause 13. Way waited until the afternoon before the return of the Motion to serve <UNDER>a 63 page factum that ignored Schembri's entire legal position</UNDER> and instead argued a brand new position that Schembri had breached a fiduciary duty owed to Way under section 134 of the <EM>OBCA</EM>. That was &ldquo;<EM>the first time [that] Schembri became aware of any allegation concerning section 134</EM>,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 143 and 154.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a position that was never pleaded by Way, that was not supported by any evidence, and that was untenable in law. The argument was an &ldquo;<EM>afterthought</EM>&rdquo; without merit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras. 180.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This position was taken by Way because Way knew that Clause 13 was unenforceable. The <EM>afterthought</EM> argument was nothing more than an attempt to obfuscate the matters at issue on the Motion in an attempt to avoid summary dismissal.</P>
<P>13. Despite Way's breach of the Rules, Schembri was intent on having the Motion heard. Mr. Wortzman concluded his oral argument in one day (as contemplated when the Motion was scheduled on consent). It quickly became apparent that Mr. Whiteley's submissions were going to take &ldquo;<EM>more than a day or two</EM>&rdquo; as he intended to take the Court through Way's 10-volume Responding Record.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 96-97.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mr. Wortzman advised that Court that in an effort to expedite the Motion, Schembri was prepared to withdraw his fallback legal position of bad conduct, <EM>&ldquo;except for the general purpose of saying that Schembri did not want to proceed with any business arrangements with Mr. Way</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 97.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Those issues were still alive if the ROFR Action went to Trial.</P>
<P>14. Following the first two days of submissions, Way served a supplementary factum that for the first time attempted to address the enforceability of Clause 13. Through Way's supplementary factum he also again attempted to obfuscate the matters at issue on the Motion through a new argument that the Motion ought to be dismissed to &ldquo;<EM>condemn</EM>&rdquo; Schembri's conduct (being the withdrawal of his fallback position to expedite the Motion).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 139.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Again, Schembri was forced to prepare responding materials to reply to Way's ever changing position at the Motion and costs were further increased.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Reasonable Expectations/ The Principle of Indemnity</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. Way is no stranger to the costs of litigation. In this highly contentious litigation between Schembri and Way alone, the Courts have, <EM>inter alia</EM>, ordered costs against Way in the Main Action in the total amount of at least $338,052.33 and he has posted another $100,000 into Court because &ldquo;<EM>the court has to have some means of enforcing its processes, particularly where there is a wealthy party who does not follow court orders and appears to this court, that he would rather pay legal fees to complicate and delay matters than simply get on with the action</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of the Honourable Justice Sloan dated December 23, 2016 at para 207.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Way has vigorously pursued this Action. Way is a sophisticated litigant who had three gowned lawyers at the Motion, while Schembri had one. Way knows the costs of commencing and pursing such an Action and the consequences of failure. As set out by Justice Sloan, the parties have been at <EM>war</EM> since 2010. Way's Motion materials make it clear that he was prepared to defend his position in the ROFR Action at all costs and on any basis, reasonable or not. Way lost this &ldquo;war&rdquo; and accordingly, must now bear the burden.</P>
<P>17. Way sought $30,500,000.00 from Schembri arising from serious allegations of wrongdoing. It was reasonable for Schembri to defend himself, his family and his businesses from such unsubstantiated allegations.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Quantum of Costs</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. As set out above, the ROFR Action was ordered tried together with the Main Action and common discoveries were ordered. The matters at issue in both Actions are interrelated and complex and to sever the costs associated with each Action and each step of the proceedings is, at times, impossible to do with precision.</P>
<P>19. The Bill of Costs is conservative and has been prepared to carefully reflect only time spent and costs incurred in relation to the ROFR Action. Certain costs, such as discoveries and the costs related to both Actions were shared 50%&mdash;50% with the Main Action in the Bill of Costs.</P>
<P>20. The amounts claimed by Schembri with respect to the ROFR Action and the Motion are reasonable, in accordance with the principles of indemnity, and should come as no surprise to Way. While such unfounded allegations typically result in substantial indemnity costs being awarded, Schembri seeks his costs on a partial indemnity scale.</P>
<P>21. Schembri is, <EM>prima facie</EM>, entitled to the entirety of his costs of the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mo v. Johnson</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 6307</CITE><PARANUM>23-24</PARANUM></CASEREF> (Tab 2).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no reason to depart from the general rule or from the mandatory wording of Rule 57.03(1) which requires that the cost of a motion be paid within 30 days.

<P>The plaintiffs (collectively, the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way&rdquo;</BOLD>) will make a motion before Mr. Justice Sloan on February 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. or as soon after that time as the motion can be heard at the court house at 85 Frederick Street, Kitchener, Ontario, N2H 0A7.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The motion is to be heard orally.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>1.</BOLD> A hearing together with a parallel motion (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Parallel Motion&rdquo;)</BOLD> in a related action bearing Court File No. CV-42-12 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;)</BOLD>;</P>
<P><BOLD>2.</BOLD> An Order:
<P1>(a) setting aside the order of the Local Registrar dated May 25, 2017 dismissing the within action for delay;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring the defendant, Gordon Schembri <BOLD>(&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;)</BOLD> to attend an examination for discovery in the within action and the Main Action from February 12 to 23, 2018, inclusive, or such further and/or other dates as fixed by this Honourable Court;</P1>
<P1>(c) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis payable forthwith; and</P1>
<P1>(d) such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court deem just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>3.</BOLD> The motion is being brought as efforts by counsel for the plaintiffs to reach a resolution with counsel for the defendants in respect of the foregoing relief have been unsuccessful;</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<P><BOLD>4.</BOLD> Schembri commenced the Main Action in Toronto in February, 2010;</P>
<P><BOLD>5.</BOLD> The Main Action was transferred to Kitchener in 2011;</P>
<P><BOLD>6.</BOLD> Schembri amended the Statement of Claim in the Main Action in 2012 and again in 2013;</P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> Presently in the Main Action, Schembri and his companies are claiming relief including damages for tens of millions of dollars;</P>
<P><BOLD>8.</BOLD> The Main Action is defended;</P>
<P><BOLD>9.</BOLD> In addition, Way asserts a counterclaim, in part, to the effect that Schembri breached a shareholders' agreement by failing to comply with the right of first refusal provisions contained therein (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Provisions&rdquo;)</BOLD> so as to allow Way to participate in the acquisition and development of other properties located in Waterloo;</P>
<P><BOLD>10.</BOLD> Schembri's breach of the ROFR Provisions are now the subject matter of the ROFR Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>11.</BOLD> There are orders, on consent, in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action that these actions are to be tried together;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Documentary Disclosure</TI>
<P><BOLD>12.</BOLD> Way swore an affidavit of documents on February 27, 2014.</P>
<P><BOLD>13.</BOLD> Counsel for Way notified Wortzman counsel for Schembri on February 20, 2014 of the types of documents Way expected Schembri to produce.</P>
<P><BOLD>14.</BOLD> Schembri swore an affidavit of documents on September 30, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri AoD&rdquo;)</BOLD>.</P>
<P><BOLD>15.</BOLD> The Schembri AoD ignored the outline set out in Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; and, for the most part, lists court documents in the Main Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>16.</BOLD> Of note, Schembri did not even list the agreements of purchase and sale for the properties that are the subject matter of the ROFR Action (which would reveal the dates on which Schembri offered to purchase the properties);</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Schembri's Deception</TI>
<P><BOLD>17.</BOLD> Counsel for Way made extensive efforts, unsuccessfully, over several months to conclude an agreement with Schembri in respect of numerous procedural matters in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action;</P>
<P><BOLD>18.</BOLD> During the course of those extensive efforts, counsel for Schembri represented that Schembri would be bringing the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>19.</BOLD> Consequently, Way caused motions to be brought in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action for various relief, including another revised timetable in the Main Action and a timetable in connection with the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>20.</BOLD> Despite suggesting otherwise, Schembri did not serve any responding materials or conduct any cross-examination, and the orders in the Main Action and the ROFR Action were issued on consent</P>
<P><BOLD>21.</BOLD> By Order of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Timetable Order&rdquo;)</BOLD>, the Court, among other things, imposed a timetable for the conduct of the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion, including the requirement that the motion record had to be served on or before September 30, 2014;</P>
<P><BOLD>22.</BOLD> The timetable in Main Action (for the examinations for discovery) had to accommodate the timetable for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion (including the cross-examinations in connection therewith);</P>
<P><BOLD>23.</BOLD> Schembri breached the ROFR Timetable Order by failing to serve his motion record by September 30, 2014;</P>
<P><BOLD>24.</BOLD> Notwithstanding his breach, Schembri continued to represent he would be bringing the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>25.</BOLD> Schembri deceived Way and this Honourable Court for the purpose of avoiding his examination for discovery in the Main Action and increasing the amount of costs being incurred by Way;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Examinations for Discovery</TI>
<P><BOLD>26.</BOLD> Way has been examined over eighteen days and asked more than 15,000 questions in connection with both the Main Action and the ROFR Action (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Way Examination&rdquo;);</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>27.</BOLD> Following the completion of the Way Examination on April 26, 2017, Schembri subsequently set the Main Action down for trial, and, as a result, the Main Action was placed on the To Be Spoken To Court list for October 27, 2017;</P>
<P><BOLD>28.</BOLD> After various delays and cancellations by Schembri, the examination for discovery of Schembri finally commenced on June 28, 2017;</P>
<P><BOLD>29.</BOLD> Following extensive efforts over many months, the Parallel Motion is being brought to fix dates for the continuation of the examination for discovery of Schembri;</P>
<P><BOLD>30.</BOLD> The dates being sought in the Parallel Motion are from February 12 to 23, 2018, inclusive;</P>
<P><BOLD>31.</BOLD> Further and other dates available to the counsel for the plaintiffs are the weeks of February 26<SUP>th</SUP> and March 19<SUP>th</SUP>;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Registrar's Dismissal Order</TI>
<P><BOLD>32.</BOLD> By Order dated May 25, 2017, the ROFR Action was dismissed by the Registrar for delay (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Dismissal Order&rdquo;)</BOLD>;</P>
<P><BOLD>33.</BOLD> Upon learning of the Dismissal Order, counsel for the plaintiffs requested promptly that counsel for the defendants consent to an order setting aside the Dismissal Order;</P>
<P><BOLD>34.</BOLD> The defendatns are willing to consent to setting aside the Dismissal Order provided that a timetable be set for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion;</P>
<P><BOLD>35.</BOLD> The plaintiffs object to a timetable being set for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion as:
<P1>(a) It ignores the relief sought in the September 2016 Affidavit;</P1>
<P1>(b) the examination for discovery of Schembri in the Main Action and the ROFR Action has yet to be completed; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the plaintiffs have failed to comply with the Rules of Civil Proceeding concerning documentary disclosure;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Relief Sought</TI>
<P><BOLD>36.</BOLD> The palintiffs seek an Order:
<P1>(a) setting aside the Dismissal Order;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring Schembri to attend an examination for discovery in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action from February 12<SUP>th</SUP> to 23<SUP>rd</SUP>, inclusive, or such other and/or further dates as may be fixed by this Honourable Court;</P1>
<P1>(c) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis forthwith;</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>37.</BOLD> Rules 1.04, 1.05, 30, 31, 37, 60.12 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>; and</P>
<P><BOLD>38.</BOLD> Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of motion:</P>
<P><BOLD>39.</BOLD> The affidavit of Alven J. Way sworn September 16, 2016;</P>
<P><BOLD>40.</BOLD> The affidavit of Alven J. Way sworn January 18, 2018; and</P>
<P><BOLD>41.</BOLD> Such further and other evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF ALVEN J. WAY (sworn January 18, 2018)</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, ALVEN J. WAY,</BOLD> businessman, of the City of Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario, make oath and say as follows.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Preliminary Comments</TI>
<P>1. I am a plaintiff, and a director of each of the corporate plaintiffs, in this proceeding (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo;</BOLD>), and a defendant, plaintiff by counterclaim in a related action bearing Court File No Court File No. C-42-11 (the &ldquo;Main Action&rdquo;). I am being sued personally in the Main Action for at least $30,000,000. As such, I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to herein except where knowledge of such facts is stated to be on information and belief and, where so stated, I verily believe those facts to be true.</P>
<P>2. Previously, I swore an affidavit on September 16, 2016 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;September 2016 Affidavit&rdquo;)</BOLD> in support of a request for an order, among other things, requiring the plaintiff, Gordon Schembri (&ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;) to attend his examination for discovery for three weeks on fixed dates in late 2016. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto is a true copy of the September 2016 Affidavit, without exhibits.</P>
<P>3. Unless otherwise defined herein, defined terms shall have the same meaning as defined in the September 2016 Affidavit. All dates referred to herein relate to 2017 unless stated otherwise.</P>
<P>4. I repeat and rely on the September 2016 Affidavit in support of the request of the plaintiffs at this time for an order:
<P1>(a) that the order of the Local Registrar dated May 25, 2017 dismissing the within action for delay be set aside;</P1>
<P1>(b) requiring Schembri to attend his examination for discovery in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action on February 12th through 23rd, inclusive, or such other and further dates as may be fixed by this Honourable Court; and</P1>
<P1>(c) costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis payable forthwith.</P1></P>
<P>5. This motion is being brought as efforts by my counsel to reach a resolution with counsel for Schembri in respect of the foregoing relief have been unsuccessful. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto are true copies of the correspondence exchanged between my counsel and counsel for Schembri since June.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Background to Motion</TI>
<P>6. As provided for in the Orders (2) of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 in the Main Action and in the ROFR Action (attached as Exhibits &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; to the September 2016 Affidavit), the Main Action and the ROFR Action are to be tried together.</P>
<P>7. Counsel for Schembri completed my examination for discovery in the Main Action and the ROFR Action on April 26<SUP>th</SUP>. Subsequently, Schembri set the Main Action down for trial.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The Registrar's Dismissal Order</TI>
<P>8. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that he was informed by counsel for Schembri in June that the ROFR Action had been dismissed for delay by the Registrar. I am further informed by Whiteley and believe that that was the first notice that he received of the Registrar's dismissal of the ROFR Action. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto is a true copy of the Order Dismissing Action for Delay dated May 25, 2017 provided by counsel for Schembri on July 26, 2017.</P>
<P>9. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that Schembri will consent to the Dismissal Order being set aside provided that I agree to a timetable for the conduct of a motion by Schembri in the ROFR Action for summary judgment (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Schembri ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;).</BOLD></P>
<P>10. I do not agree to a timetable being set for the Schembri ROFR SJ Motion for three reasons.</P>
<P>11. First, setting a timetable ignores the relief sought in the September 2016 Affidavit that Schembri be prohibited from bringing a motion for summary judgment, in whole or in part.</P>
<P>12. Secondly, my counsel has yet to complete the examination for discovery of Schembri, whereas counsel for Schembri has completed an examination for discovery of me (in both the Main Action and the ROFR Action). In total, my examination for discovery in the Main Action and the ROFR Action took place over eighteen days and I was asked more than fifteen thousand questions.</P>
<P>13. Thirdly, as stated in paragraph 12 of the September 2016 Affidavit, I believe that Schembri has failed to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure concerning documentary disclosure.</P>
<P>14. I have learned subsequently that Schembri caused the property purchased by the defendant, 5 Rittenhouse Inc., to be sold. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that 5 Rittenhouse Inc. has not produced any documents whatsoever relating to the purchase and sale of this property as appears from the Affidavit of Documents sworn September 30, 2014 by Schembri (being Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the September 2016 Affidavit).</P>
<P>15. In June, I was informed by Joe Benninger, a real estate agent in Kitchener-Waterloo, and believe that Schembri: (a) purchased a property at the corner of Bridgeport Road and Weber Street in Waterloo with the intent to build a high-rise apartment building; and (b) owned another property in Kitchener on which he is constructing a medical building. I am informed by Whiteley and believe that Schembri has not produced any documents relating to the purchases of these properties.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Examination for Discovery of Schembri</TI>
<P>16. Today I have sworn an affidavit in the Main Action, among other things, addressing the background to and history of the examination for discovery of Schembri, along with the extensive efforts by my counsel to continue with that examination at the earliest possible opportunity (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Main Action Affidavit&rdquo;).</BOLD> Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> hereto is a true copy of the Main Action Affidavit, without exhibits.</P>
<P>17. I repeat and rely on the Main Action Affidavit in support of the request herein that Schembri attend for discovery on February 12th through 23rd, inclusive, or such other and further dates as may be fixed by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>18. I swear this affidavit for the purpose stated in paragraph 2 above, and for no other improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, John Paul Ventrella, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a Lawyer with the law firm of Teplitsky, Colson LLP, the lawyers for the Plaintiffs in the Main Action (as that term is hereinafter defined) and the Defendants to the ROFR Action (as that term is hereinafter defined) (collectively &ldquo;Schembri&rdquo;), and, as such, have knowledge of the matters contained in this affidavit. Where I do not have personal knowledge, I have stated the source of my knowledge and do verily believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. There are two companion actions being case-managed by the Honourable Mr. Justice Sloan:
<P1>(a) The &ldquo;Main Action&rdquo; bearing Court File no. C-42-11 which was commenced in Toronto in 2010 and transferred to Kitchener in 2011; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The &ldquo;ROFR Action&rdquo; bearing Court File No C-457-12, which was commenced by way of Notice of Action dated May 25, 2012.</P1></P>
<P>3. On September 4, 2014, the Honourable Mr. Justice Broad ordered on consent, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Main Action and the ROFR Action be tried together. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit are true copies of the Orders of Justice Broad dated September 4, 2014 in both the Main Action and ROFR Action (&ldquo;Broad Order&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. Pursuant to the Broad Order in the ROFR Action, a timetable was set for the delivery of materials related to the Plaintiffs' proposed motion for Summary Judgment.</P>
<P>5. I am advised by Mr. Wortzman and do verily believe that Schembri did not pursue the summary judgment motion in the ROFR Action at that time, and instead proceeded to examine the Defendants in the Main Action for discovery. I am further advised by Mr. Wortzman and do verily believe that Schembri never abandoned their intention to pursue the summary judgment motion.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>PROCEEDING IN THE MAIN ACTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. Between late 2014 and late 2016, the Plaintiffs experienced significant difficulty in proceeding with the Main Action as a result of, <EM>inter alia</EM>, Way's conduct throughout examinations for discovery. A more complete and particularized history of the delay experienced as a result of Way's conduct is outlined in my affidavit sworn on January 23, 2018, and filed in support of the Plaintiffs' motion returnable on February 8, 2018, with respect to the Main Action (&ldquo;Original Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. The &ldquo;<EM>tortured</EM>&rdquo; history of this matter is also clearly summarized in various Endorsements of the Honourable Justice Sloan, including His Honour's Endorsement dated December 23, 2016 at, <EM>inter alia</EM>, paragraphs 181 through 197, wherein Justice Sloan found, among other things, that:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;<EM>trying to get the defendants' undertakings answered has been akin to &lsquo;pulling teeth&rsquo;</EM>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;<EM>It is evident an I find as fact, that Mr. Way did not fulfill his obligations to answer his undertakings in anything close to an appropriate fashion and in an appropriate time frame</EM>&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;<EM>Mr. Way put in an extremely lacklustre effort to comply with his obligations with respect to his undertakings and refusals</EM>.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>8. Attached hereto and marked collectively as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the Endorsement of Mr. Justice Sloan dated December 23, 2016 (&ldquo;December 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Endorsement&rdquo;) along with a copy of the corresponding Cost Endorsement of Justice Sloan dated January 30, 2017 (&ldquo;Cost Endorsement&rdquo;).</P>
<P>9. The December 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Endorsement, and Cost Endorsement were released by Justice Sloan following, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the hearing of a Motion to Strike Way's pleadings in the Main Action. The said motion was argued over 5 days in September, November and December 2016 (&ldquo;Motion to Strike&rdquo;).</P>
<P>10. In preparation for the Motion to Strike, the parties participated in a conference call with Justice Sloan on or about August 25, 2016, at which time a timetable was established for the hearing of Schembri's Motion to Strike.</P>
<P>11. In this regard, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is true copy of a letter from Mr. Kulathungam to Mr. Whiteley dated August 25, 2016, clearly setting out the timetable for the Motion to Strike as confirmed by Justice Sloan as follows, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) Schembri to serve motion materials by August 29, 2016;</P1>
<P1>(b) Way to serve responding materials by September 6, 2016;</P1>
<P1>(c) Motion returnable on September 21, 2016.
<P2>(the &ldquo;Timetable&rdquo;)</P2></P1></P>
<P>12. I am advised by Mr. Kulathungam that at the time of the August 25, 2016, conference call, Way did not in any way advise Justice Sloan or our office that they intended to proceed with any motions with respect to the Main Action, ROFR Action or otherwise.</P>
<P>13. In accordance with the Timetable, Schembri served their materials with respect to the Motion to Strike returnable September 21, 2016. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of a letter from myself to Mr. Whiteley dated August 29, 2016, serving the said motion materials (without attachments).</P>
<P>14. Way breached the Timetable in that they failed to serve any responding materials with respect to the Motion to Strike by September 6, 2016.</P>
<P>15. On or about September 8, 2016, our office received a letter by way of e-mail from Mr. Whiteley, <EM>inter alia</EM>, serving:
<P1>(a) a Notice of Motion in the Main Action for a motion returnable on September 21, 2016; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the affidavit of Way sworn September 6, 2016 (without attachments) in support of Way's proposed motion.</P1></P>
<P>16. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Whiteley's letter of September 8, 2016 (with Notice of Motion only).</P>
<P>17. On or about September 9, 2016, Mr. Wortzman wrote to Mr. Whiteley, among other things:
<P1>(a) Confirming that his office's never previously advised our office or Justice Sloan that Way would be bringing a motion on September 21, 2016; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Advising that our office would be objecting to Way's proposed motion being heard on September 21, 2016.</P1></P>
<P>18. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Wortzman's letter dated September 9, 2016 to Mr. Whiteley.</P>
<P>19. Following service of Way's motion materials for a motion returnable on September 21, 2017, with respect to the Main Action, Mr. Whitely also served a Motion Record with respect to a motion in the ROFR Action which was also to be returnable on September 21, 2016.</P>
<P>20. Way's proposed motion with respect to the ROFR Action sought, among other things, that Schembri be barred from bringing a summary judgment motion, in whole or in part, in the ROFR Action. An affidavit sworn by Way on September 16, 2016 was provided in support of Way's proposed motion.</P>
<P>21. Again, Way's proposed motion in the ROFR Action was not canvassed during the August 25, 2016, conference call with Justice Sloan or contemplated when the September 21, 2016 motion date was set. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the Notice of Motion with respect Mr. Whiteley's proposed motion in the ROFR Action (&ldquo;ROFR Motion&rdquo;)</P>
<P>22. Ultimately, Justice Sloan refused to hear any arguments with respect to Way's ROFR Motion during the hearing of the Motion to Strike and adjourned the said motion to a date to be set by the Trial Coordinator.</P>
<P>23. After arguing the Motion to Strike over a 4 <TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> day period and the release of Justice Sloan's December 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Endorsement, Mr. Whitley has taken no steps whatsoever to have Way's ROFR Motion heard. It would appear that the said motion has been abandoned and that Way was no longer seeking an Order to bar Schembri from bringing a summary judgment motion in the ROFR Action.</P>
<P>24. Way's ROFR Motion, while served in September 2016, was never again pursued. It has been dormant for about 15 months.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>MAY 19, 2017 CONFERENCE CALL</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. Following issuance of the December 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Endorsement and Cost Endorsement, Schembri continued to encounter difficulties in moving the Main Action forward. Particulars of the difficulties encountered by Schembri in moving the Main Action forward are set out in my Original Affidavit beginning at paragraph 31.</P>
<P>26. A conference call was scheduled before Justice Sloan on May 19, 2017.</P>
<P>27. One of the main issues that Schembri sought to address during the said conference call was with respect to obtaining an Order from the Court allowing Schembri to set the Main Action down for Trial <UNDER>without prejudice to their rights to bring a summary judgment motion in the ROFR Action.</UNDER></P>
<P>28. In this regard, on or around May 18, 2017, our office served Mr. Whiteley's office with a Motion Record in support of Schembri's summary judgment motion in the ROFR Action (&ldquo;ROFR SJ Motion&rdquo;) and advised Mr. Whitely that we would be seeking a return date for the said motion during the May 19, 2017, conference call. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of our letter to Mr. Whiteley (without attachments).</P>
<P>29. On or around May 19, 2017, the parties participated in a telephone conference call with Justice Sloan to address various issues with respect to the Main Action and ROFR Action. I was a participant in the conference call along with Messrs. Wortzman, Kulathungam and Whiteley.</P>
<P>30. During the May 19 conference call, the parties specifically addressed Schembri's proposed ROFR SJ Motion. At the conclusion of the May 19 conference call, Justice Sloan, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<P1>(a) Ordered that Schembri be entitled to set the Main Action down for Trial without prejudice to their rights to bring the ROFR SJ Motion;</P1>
<P1>(b) Directed Mr. Wortzman to circulate a draft Order with respect to setting the Main Action down for Trial without prejudice to bring the ROFR SJ Motion; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Advised counsel to seek the assistance of the Trial Coordinator to schedule the return date for the ROFR SJ Motion.</P1></P>
<P>31. Justice Sloan's Order with respect to the ROFR SJ Motion was partly confirmed in a letter to our office from Mr. Whiteley's office dated May 19, 2017, which stated, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<QUOTE><P><EM>I confirm that Justice Sloan has directed you to prepare and circulate a draft Order providing for the matter to be set down for trial, subject to a carve out for the Motion Record in the ROFR Action containing the Notice of Motion dated May 11, 2017 and the affidavit of Mr. Schembri sworn May 17, 2017</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr., Whiteley's letter dated May 19, 2017.</P>
<P>33. On or about May 23, 2017, I provided Mr. Whiteley with a draft Order in accordance with Justice Sloan's direction of May 19, 2017. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of my said letter to Mr. Whiteley with draft Order attached.</P>
<P>34. On or about May 24, 2017, Mr. Wortzman also wrote to Ms. Cox, being the Trial Coordinator seeking available dates for the ROFR SJ Motion. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Wortzman's letter to Ms. Cox.</P>
<P>35. Mr. Whiteley disagreed with the draft Order provided by our office and, in this regard, served us with a copy of his proposed draft Order. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Whiteley's letter dated May 24, 2017, including draft Order.</P>
<P>36. It is important to note that Mr. Whiteley's proposed draft Order expressly provided for leave for Schembri to set the matter down for trial without prejudice to the ROFR SJ Motion. Of contention was the fact that Mr. Whiteley's preamble to the proposed draft Order was inaccurate and the Order sought to include, <EM>inter alia</EM>, relief that was not granted by Justice Sloan, including an Order that Schembri set the matter down for Trial by no later than May 31, 2017.</P>
<P>37. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Wortzman's letter written to Mr. Whiteley dated May 25, 2017, in response to Mr. Whiteley's May 24 letter which states, <EM>inter alia</EM>:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Your Order makes it seem as though a motion was heard on May 19, 2017 to compel Mr. Schembri to set the action down for trial. That never happened</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Furthermore, paragraph 2 of your</EM> <UNDER><EM>draft</EM></UNDER> <EM>Order is not sufficient</EM>. <BOLD><EM>What we requested and what we received, was an Order granting Mr. Schembri leave to continue with the summary judgment motion and the ROFR action notwithstanding the fact that he sets the main action down for trial</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>Please approve the</EM> <UNDER><EM>draft</EM></UNDER> <EM>Order we sent to you as to form and content so that we can set the main action down for trial</EM>.</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. Mr. Whiteley would not approve the draft Order dated May 19, 2017 prepared by our office as to form and content. The draft Order remains unissued and un-entered.</P>
<P>39. Attached hereto and marked collectively as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is further correspondence as between our office and Mr. Whiteley's office with respect to the draft Order. In an attempt to resolve matters and have the draft Order issued, Mr. Wortzman expressly advised Mr. Whiteley that the Order could be &ldquo;<EM>without prejudice to you seeking whatever order you want, if and when you formally bring on for hearing the motions that had been adjourned last September</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>40. On or about May 31, 2017, Mr. Wortzman also wrote further to Ms. Cox, <EM>inter alia</EM>, again seeking return dates for the ROFR SJ Motion. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of Mr. Wortzman's letter to Ms. Cox dated May 31, 2017.</P>
<P>41. We never received motion dates from Ms. Cox and this may be, as will be set out below, because the ROFR Action was dismissed for delay.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE ROFR ACTION IS DISMISSED</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. Schembri intended to set the Main Action down for Trial. Out of an abundance of caution, they could not do so as Way would not approve the draft Order of Justice Sloan dated May 19, 2017, allowing Schembri to set the matter down for Trial without prejudice to their rights to bring a summary judgment motion in the ROFR Action.</P>
<P>43. Schembri's Trial Record was served upon counsel for the Defendants on or about June 6, 2017. I specifically advised Mr. Whiteley that we would not be filing the Trial Record with the Court until such time as the draft Order was approved as to form and content and issued and entered by the Court. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of my letter to Mr. Whiteley in this regard.</P>
<P>44. In or around June of 2017, our office received an Order dismissing the ROFR Action for delay by mail from the Court. I cannot recall the exact date that the Order was received. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a true copy of the Registrar's Order dated May 25, 2017 (&ldquo;Dismissal Order&rdquo;).</P>
<P>45. Given that the ROFR Action was dismissed for delay, the ROFR SJ Motion was no longer necessary. Schembri filed the Trial Record with respect to the Main Action. Attached hereto and marked collectively as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit are true copies of correspondence from Mr. Wortzman to Mr. Whiteley dated July 5 and 10, 2017.</P>
<P>46. Schembri has continually and consistently advised Way that they would consent to an Order setting aside the Dismissal Order subject to Way agreeing to a reasonable timetable for the hearing of the ROFR SJ Motion. Way refused to do so.</P>
<P>47. Attached hereto and marked collectively as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo; to</BOLD> this my affidavit are true copies of correspondence from our office to Mr. Whiteley's office, <EM>inter alia</EM>, with respect to setting aside the registrars dismissal and establishing a timetable for the ROFR SJ Motion.</P>
<P>48. Despite the fact that Schembri's motion materials for the ROFR SJ motion were served in May of 2017, Way will not agree to a timetable for the said motion and has not bothered to serve any responding materials.</P>
<P>49. Way had also not served any motion material to set aside the Dismissal Order until last week.</P>
<P>50. Schembri remains prepared to consent to set aside the Dismissal Order, subject to a timetable for the ROFR SJ Motion being agreed upon or ordered.</P>
<P>51. I swear this affidavit in response to the motions brought by the Defendants returnable on February 8, 2018, and in support of the Plaintiffs' cross-motion, and for no other or improper purpose.</P>
