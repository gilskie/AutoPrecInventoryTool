<BLOCK2><TI>The Cosmos Towers Project (Origin and Cancellation)</TI>
<P>13. In or about 2016, Liberty promoted the sale of pre-construction condominium units in three proposed towers for a Liberty project called the Cosmos Condominiums or Cosmos Towers (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;), to be located in Woodbridge, at premises legally described as part of Lots 1 and 2, Registered Plan 7977, City of Vaughan, Regional Municipality of York in the Province of Ontario. The Project was comprised of approximately 1,100 units.</P>
<P>14. The Project quickly sold out, meaning all condominium units available for sale were sold to the applicants and other purchasers, prior to any of the three towers in the Project being constructed.</P>
<P>15. In or around the month of May, 2016 until in or about the month of November,2016,all applicants signed a standard form agreement of purchase and sale (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;) with one of the two numbered company Vendors. The Contracts were drafted by the Vendors and contained identical terms and conditions including Condition #2.</P>
<P>16. All applicants provided a deposit and made all requisite installment payments/deposits in accordance with the Contract.</P>
<P>17. In or around April, 2018, (some two years after the applicants had committed to purchasing a unit in the Project and seen the price for condominium units in Vaughan drastically increase), the applicants were notified by Liberty and the Vendors that the Project was cancelled. The Contracts were terminated, ostensibly based on Condition #2.</P>
<P>18. A cancellation letter was mailed to the applicants and all other purchasers. The letter was written on Liberty letterhead, including Liberty's trademark/logo and signed by Shawn Richardson, Director of Sales and Marketing for Liberty, for and on behalf of the Vendors. The letter for and on behalf of 1945086 Ontario Inc. reads:
<QUOTE><P>PLEASE NOTE THAT:</P>
<P>1. The Early Termination Condition #2 contained on page 5B of the Tarion Addendum attached to die Purchase Agreement described as follows:</P>
<P><UNDER><EM>The Purchase Agreement is conditional upon receipt by the Vendor of confirmation that financing for the project on terms satisfactory to the Vendor has been arranged</EM>.</UNDER> <EM>The Approving Authority (as that term is described in Schedule A) is:</EM> <UNDER><EM>n/a, the determination of the Vendor in its sole, absolute and unfettered discretion, (note the underlining appears in the letter)</EM></UNDER></P>
<P>Pursuant to paragraph 6(d) of the Tarion Addendum, the date by which the Early Termination Condition #2 must be satisfied is July 2, 2019, which is 90 days before the First Tentative Occupancy Date.</P>
<P>2. Please take note that Early Termination Condition #2 has not been satisfied nor waived within the required period under the Purchase Agreement despite us having taken all commercially reasonable steps to satisfy same.</P>
<P>3. In accordance with Section 6 and 10(d) of the Tarion Addendum attached thereto, the Purchase Agreement is hereby terminated.</P>
<P>4. Following this notice via a subsequent letter in the next 10 days will be a cheque representing reimbursement of all deposit monies paid by you together with any interest as prescribed by the <UNDER>Condominium Act, 1998</UNDER> to the same Purchaser address herein.</P>
<P>Yours truly, For and on behalf of 1945086 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>Per:</P>
<P>Shawn Richardson, Director of Sales and Marketing</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. In addition to the cancellation letter, Liberty also forwarded a letter to the applicants and all other purchasers. Liberty claimed that the &ldquo;Vendors&rdquo; were forced to cancel all Contracts and that the Vendors would be returning all deposits. The letter was also signed by the same Shawn Richardson, Director of Sales &amp; Marketing for Liberty. This letter read in part:
<QUOTE><P>While the Cosmos project earned strong sales success, support from realtors, and encouragement from key stakeholders, we are advised by the project vendor that at this time financing for the project on terms satisfactory to the Vendor cannot be arranged.</P>
<P>As the financing arrangements on satisfactory terms to the project vendor cannot be obtained it will force the project vendor to now cancel all Agreements of Purchase and Sale in keeping with the terms of these agreements and the Early Termination Conditions in the agreement's Tarion Addendum. As such, the project vendor shall be returning all purchaser deposits collected to date in the days to come. The required Tarion notice effecting same is attached.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>We recognize that today's decision will impact our purchasers and the project vendor would have preferred an alternative to cancelling agreements. Unfortunately there is no alternative. Accordingly, working with the vendor we must move to cancel all agreements, distribute refund of deposits, and work to ensure the process for return of these funds is smooth, efficient and easy for those affected.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>20. As of the date of this Notice of Application, Liberty is planning a new condominium project adjacent to the cancelled Project (being the project cancelled ostensibly for lack of satisfactory financing) and will be redeveloping its recent acquisition of the Promenade Mall to modernize the mall and construct three residential apartment towers of 28 to 35 stories with 1,006 units, as well as offices and a hotel with a combined 24,392 square metres of space.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Condition #2 is prohibited by Tarion.</TI>
<P>21. Each applicant entered into a standard form contract with one of the respondent Vendors to purchase one or more units in the Project The Contract was drafted by the Vendors, including Condition #2.</P>
<P>22. For purchasers of units in Towers A and B, the purchaser entered into the Contract with the respondent 1945086 Ontario Inc. For purchasers of units in Tower HI, the purchasers entered into the Contract with the respondent 1945087 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>23. The Contract provides that the purchaser will make down payments of specified amounts on a specified number of days following the execution of the Contract. Under the heading &ldquo;CLOSING&rdquo;, the Contract provides that the purchase and sale of the condominium unit will be completed and the unit will be transferred to the purchaser &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on a date (the &ldquo;Unit Transfer Date&rdquo;) that is the later of (i) the Occupancy Date and (ii) a date fixed by the Vendor upon which the transfer of the Unit acceptable for registration is delivered to the Purchaser or his solicitor.&rdquo;</P>
<P>24. In each instance, the Contract is signed by both the purchaser(s) and the respondent Vendor.</P>
<P>25. The Contract includes a twelve page Tarion Condominium Form (&ldquo;Tarion Addendum&rdquo;), which by regulation is incorporated into all pre-construction condominium contracts in Ontario and constitutes a form of consumer protection legislation.</P>
<P>26. Tarion Warranty Corporation (&ldquo;Tarion&rdquo;) is a not-for-profit corporation incorporated under the <EM>Corporations Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38, which is responsible for administering the warranties under the <EM>Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c 0.31, for new home buyers including purchasers of condominium units.</P>
<P>27. The Tarion Addendum provides in paragraph 6(b) for certain defined early termination conditions that may be included by the Vendors in the Contract, which are set out in Schedule A to the Tarion Addendum. No early termination condition can be included in the Contract other than the conditions authorized in Schedule A by Tarion.</P>
<P>28. The early termination condition authorized by Tarion is set out in paragraph 1.(b)(ii) of Schedule A and reads as follows:
<QUOTE><P>1. <BOLD>The Vendor of a condominium home is permitted to make the Purchase Agreement conditional as follows:</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>(b) upon:
<QUOTE><P>(ii) receipt by the Vendor of confirmation that financing for the project on terms satisfactory to the Vendor has been arranged by a specified date;</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. The Vendors' version of the permitted early termination condition is set out in an Appendix located at page 5B of the Tarion Addendum, which is reproduced below:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI>Condition #2</TI>
<P>Description of the Early Termination Condition: <UNDER>The Purchase Agreement is conditional upon receipt by the Vendor of confirmation that financing for the project on terms satisfactory to the Vendor has been arranged.</UNDER></P>
<P>The Approving Authority (as that term is defined in Schedule A) is: <UNDER>n/a, the determination of the Vendor in its sole, absolute, and unfettered discretion.</UNDER></P>
<P>The date by which Condition #2 is to be satisfied is the &ellip10; day of &ellip10;, 20 &ellip10;.</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. Condition #2 was reproduced in the cancellation letter sent to all applicants as the basis for cancelling the Contract, as described in paragraph 18 of this Notice of Application.</P>
<P>31. Condition #2 is not authorized/permitted by Tarion. It does not comply with paragraph 6(a) or 6(b) of the Tarion Addendum. Paragraph 6(a) reads as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(a) The Vendor and Purchaser may include conditions in the Purchase Agreement that, if not satisfied, give rise to early termination of the Purchase Agreement, but only in the limited way described in this section.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. Condition #2 includes &ldquo;the determination of the Vendor in its sole, absolute, and unfettered discretion.&rdquo; The Vendors have therefore included one or more conditions which do not conform with the limited way early termination of the Purchase Agreement is authorized in paragraph 6(a).</P>
<P>33. Paragraph 6(b) reads as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(b) The Vendor is not permitted to include any conditions in the Purchase Agreement other than: the types of Early Termination Conditions listed in Schedule A; and/or the conditions referred to in paragraphs (i), (j) and (k) below. Any other condition included in a Purchase Agreement for the benefit of the Vendor that is not expressly permitted under Schedule A or paragraphs (i), (j), and (k) below is deemed null and void and is not enforceable by the Vendor, but does not affect the validity of the balance of the Purchase Agreement</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. The permitted early termination condition, as set out in 1(b)(ii) of Schedule A, is limited to confirmation that financing for the Project on terms satisfactory to the Vendor has been arranged. Condition #2 includes additional terms and conditions, &ldquo;the determination of the Vendor in its sole, absolute, and unfettered discretion.&rdquo; Financing on terms satisfactory to the Vendor is not the same type of condition as Condition #2.</P>
<P>35. Paragraph 6(f) of the Tarion Addendum provides:
<QUOTE><P>(f) The Vendor agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps within its power to satisfy the Early Termination Conditions identified in subparagraph (d) above.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. The Tarion Addendum provides for an all-commercially-reasonable-steps standard, which the Vendors must satisfy before exercising and when exercising early termination condition 1(b)(ii). Condition #2 effectively contracts the Vendors out of the commercially reasonable standard, in favour of a sole/absolute/unfettered discretion standard.</P>
<P>37. Pursuant to paragraph 6(b), Condition #2 is therefore deemed null and void and is not enforceable by the Vendors because &ldquo;any other condition included in a purchase agreement for the benefit of the Vendor that is not expressly permitted under Schedule A...is deemed null and void and not enforceable by the Vendor.&rdquo;</P>
<P>38. The Vendors therefore breached the Contracts by terminating the Contracts based on Condition #2.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Damages</TI>
<P>39. The applicants have all sustained damages for breach of contract, including the loss of the market value of the unit at closing compared to the purchase price, or alternatively, the loss of the market value of the unit at the time of the breach, compared to the purchase price; loss of use and enjoyment of the unit once built; loss of their promised home; lost rental income; enhanced carrying charges and the enhanced cost to replace the unit with a comparable alternative condominium unit in Vaughan at today's prices or in some cases the complete loss of the ability to purchase a condominium unit, as current prices have made it unaffordable.</P>
<P>40. The applicants claim that the damages for breach of contract can be determined on an aggregate damages basis.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Liberty induced the Vendors to breach the Contracts</TI>
<P>41. The Contracts between the Vendors and applicants were valid and enforceable contracts.</P>
<P>42. Liberty knew of the Contracts between the applicants and Vendors.</P>
<P>43. Liberty was the developer of the Project and promoted the sale of the condominium units to the applicants and other purchasers.</P>
<P>44. Liberty and the Vendors have always operated as one joint enterprise where Liberty completely controlled the operations of the Vendors in all respects. Liberty made the decision to cancel the Project and made the decision to justify the cancellation based on Condition #2. Liberty then induced and directed its Vendor numbered companies to breach the Contracts.</P>
<P>45. Liberty exercised complete control over the Vendors directly or alternatively did so indirectly, through means of affiliated corporations or family members, and/or through owning or controlling the majority of the common shares in the Vendor corporations.</P>
<P>46. The applicants suffered damages as a result of Liberty inducing a breach of the contracts.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>A certificate of pending litigation is warranted.</TI>
<P>47. 1834371 Ontario Inc. and the Vendors are controlled by Liberty and operated together as one economic unit in making all decisions about the Project, including its cancellation.</P>
<P>48. 1834371 Ontario Inc. formed part of the organization who unlawfully cancelled the Contracts.</P>
<P>49. On or about January 31, 2012, 1834371 Ontario Inc. purchased the Lands municipally described as 2951 Highway #7 West, Vaughan; 180 Maplecrete Road, Vaughan; and 190 Maplecrete Road, Vaughan.</P>
<P>50. On January 26, 2017, a charge was registered against the Lands in the amount of $100 million in favour of The Guarantee Company of North America. It continues to be a charge on title as of the date of pleading. The Chargor is 1834371 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>51. Schedule 2 of the Charge includes a collateral mortgage dated January 24, 2017, regarding an indemnity agreement between 1945086 Ontario Inc. and 1945087 Ontario Inc., the Chargee and 1834371 Ontario Inc. As of the date of pleading, the applicants do not know the terms of the indemnity agreement.</P>
<P>52. The respondent 1834371 Ontario Inc. knew that the Vendors and Liberty were promoting the Project and knew that the Vendors sold condominium units to the applicants, thereby providing the applicants with an interest or beneficial interest in the Lands.</P>
<P>53. 1834371 Ontario Inc. held the Lands in trust for the Vendors, on the basis that the Lands would be conveyed to a condominium corporation at closing.</P>
<P>54. A certificate of pending litigation issued against the Lands is warranted as the applicants have an equitable interest in the Lands; the Vendors have no assets; 1834371 Ontario Inc. is a third party beneficiary to the Contracts; and 1834371 Ontario Inc. holds the Lands in trust for the Vendors to complete the Contracts. Liberty deliberately arranged for a corporation, which it completely controls, to hold title to the Lands knowing that if the Vendors breached the contracts, the Vendors are shell corporations without assets. Therefore, in the circumstances, the justice of the case is such that this Court should disregard the separate corporate existence of 1834371 Ontario Inc. for the purposes of issuing a certificate of pending litigation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The applicants may bring this proceeding as an application under rule 14.05 of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</TI>
<P>55. The applicants can bring this proceeding as an application because the applicants are seeking a determination of the applicants' rights that depend on the interpretation of a contract and/or the interpretation of a statute, being the <EM>Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c 0.31 and regulations thereunder, pursuant to Rule 14.05(3)(d) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>56. The applicants can further bring this proceeding as an application because:
<P1>a. the applicants are seeking a declaration that the respondent Vendors breached the contract, pursuant to Rule 14.05(3)(g) of the <EM>Rules</EM>;</P1>
<P1>b. with respect to the claim for breach of contract against the Vendors, there are not likely to be any material facts in dispute, pursuant to Rule 14.05(3)(h) of the <EM>Rules;</EM> and</P1>
<P1>c. the applicants seek as ancillary relief to the declaration a certificate of pending litigation, pursuant to Rule 14.05(3)(g) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The applicants and respondents are proper parties to the Application.</TI>
<P>57. All the applicants may join their claims against the respondents in one application, pursuant to rule 5.01(1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (&ldquo;<EM>Rules</EM>&rdquo;)</P>
<P>58. The applicants can bring different claims against the respondents in the same application, and it is not necessary for each of the applicants to have an interest in all of the relief claimed or in each of the claims against the respondents, pursuant to rule 5.01(2) and (3) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>59. The applicants may join each of their claims against the respondents in this Application because they are asserting claims that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences; there are common questions of law or fact; and joining the claims in the same application will promote the convenient administration of justice, pursuant to rule 5.02(1) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>60. Liberty is a proper party to the Application pursuant to rule 5.03(1) of the <EM>Rules</EM> because it has an interest in participating in the Application to determine the declaratory relief sought in paragraphs 1 and 2. In the event that the relief is granted, the applicants seek a trial of an issue against Liberty.</P>
<P>61. The applicants may join their claims against all the respondents including Liberty in this Application because they are asserting claims against the respondents which arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; there are common questions of law or fact; damage or loss has been caused to the applicants by more than one of the respondents including by Liberty and there is doubt as to the respondents whom the applicants are entitled to relief or the respective amounts for which each respondent may be liable; and joining the claims in the same Application will promote the convenient administration of justice, pursuant to Rule 5.02(2) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>62. The respondent 1834371 Ontario Inc., as owner of the Lands, is a proper party to the Application because the applicants seek a certificate of pending litigation pursuant to Rule 42 of the <EM>Rules</EM> and section 103 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, in the event that the declaratory relief is granted.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The applicants seek to have the issue of whether the Vendors breached the Contracts determined on this Application with the remaining issues ordered to proceed to a trial of an issue.</TI>
<P>63. The applicants are seeking on this Application a declaration that Early Termination Condition #2 (on which the Vendors solely relied to terminate the Contract) is null and void and not enforceable, and therefore the Vendors breached the Contract in terminating the Contract.</P>
<P>64. In the event that the Court finds that the respondent Vendors breached the Contracts and grants declaratory relief, the applicants then seek to have the cause of action against Liberty for inducing breach of contract and the applicants' damages against the Vendors and Liberty proceed to a trial of an issue, pursuant to Rules 1.05, 38.10(1)(b) and 38.10(3) of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>65. Determining the interpretation of the Contract and consequent question of whether the Vendors breached the Contract by cancelling the Project, is the central issue in these proceedings. The application is therefore the most proportionate, expeditious, and least expensive means of determining the merits of this proceeding, pursuant to Rule 1.04 of the <EM>Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>66. The <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended, including Rules 1.04, 1.05, 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 13.1.02, 14.05, and 38.</P>
<P>67. The <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, includes section 103.</P>
<P>68. The <EM>Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c O.31, and,</P>
<P>69. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the application:</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF SANJAY REDDY</TI>
<P>I, SANJAY REDDY, of the City of Brampton, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am an applicant in these proceedings and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed. Where that knowledge is based on information obtained from others, I have so indicated and believe that information to be true.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. On April 30, 2016, I purchased Unit # [#omitted] in Tower A of the Cosmos Tower project. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is my agreement of purchase and sale (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). The Vendor is the respondent 1945086 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>3. My agreement included a standard 12 page Tarion Condominium Form (the &ldquo;Tarion Addendum&rdquo;) plus page 5B (inserted by the Vendor) entitled &ldquo;Appendix Early Termination Conditions&rdquo; where Condition #2 is set out (the &ldquo;Early Termination Condition #2&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. I am advised by Kiara Sander (a law clerk at Charney Lawyers PC) and believe that the agreement I signed is a standard form, signed by all applicants in Towers A, B and III which included the Tarion Addendum and the same appendix with Early Termination Condition #2. With respect to Tower III, the Vendor was the respondent 1945087 Ontario Inc.</P>
<P>5. I am advised by Ms. Sander and believe that all applicants signed the Agreement as detailed in Schedule A to the Notice of Application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>THE CANCELLATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. On or about April 4<SUP>th</SUP> and 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018, I received two letters. I received one from the respondent Liberty Development Corporation and one from the respondents 1945086 Ontario Inc. and 1945087 Ontario Inc., (albeit on Liberty stationary) informing me the project was cancelled. The basis for the cancellation was Early Termination Condition #2. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> are the letters.</P>
<P>7. I am advised by Ms. Sander that all applicants received the same two letters.</P>
<P>8. I am advised by Ms. Sander and believe that Bratty and Partners also mailed a letter to all applicants returning deposits, while reiterating how the vendor exercised its right to terminate the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the Tarion Addendum. A sample of the letter is included here as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>9. I am advised by Ms. Ina Cici, an applicant in this proceeding, and believe that she purchase Unit [#omitted] Tower B of the Cosmos Tower Project on May 5, 2016. Her agreement is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>. Ms. Cici received the same cancellation letters as I did.</P>
<P>10. I am advised by Ms. Carla Gravina, an applicant in this proceeding, and believe that she purchased Unit [#omitted] Tower III of the Cosmos Tower Project on October 1, 2016. Her agreement is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD>. Ms. Gravina received the same cancellation letters as I did.</P>
<P>11. I understand that Tarion has a mandate to provide warranties to Ontario purchasers of new homes and protect consumers who are purchasing new homes. As part of its work in fulfilling its mandate, it publishes information to educate consumers of their rights. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is an explanation of the &ldquo;tentative occupancy date&rdquo; requirements under the Tarion Addendum, which includes an explanation of the early termination conditions.</P>
<P>12. I have sustained damages because the project was cancelled. Since 2016 the market price for condominiums in Vaughan has significantly increased. The increase in pre-construction market prices for condominiums in Vaughan is well documented in the news. I have been following the price increases for new pre-construction condominium units. Current sales prices to purchase comparable units pre-construction are much higher now, as indicated in recent studies by industry associations, attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF LIBERTY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND 1834371 ONTARIO INC. BEING PROPER PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. When I was considering purchasing a unit in the Cosmos Tower Project it was being promoted to the public as a Liberty Development project. I recall going to a Liberty Development website where the project was promoted as a Liberty Development project. I attended a presentation center where the centre itself and all of the promotional material characterized the project as a Liberty Development project.</P>
<P>14. For instance, a sketch of my proposed unit includes the Liberty Development trademark/logo with a disclaimer from Liberty Development Corporation &ldquo;All rights reserved&rdquo;. The special preview price list for Tower A includes the same trademark with a slogan &ldquo;LIBERTYforall.ca&rdquo; and a footnote indicating &ldquo;Liberty Development Corporation, 2016. All rights reserved. Brokers protected.&rdquo; The Cosmos Tower A worksheet has the web address for the project <UNDER>www.cosmoscondos.ca</UNDER> but the web site no longer has the promotional information it did at the time the units were for sale. Special Preview Price List for Tower B has the same logo and slogan. These documents are collectively attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>15. I also received a glossy brochure promoting the sale of the units available in Tower A, which was available to all who attended the presentation center. The 62 page brochure includes Liberty Development's logo on the back cover and a description of Liberty's history at page 61 &ldquo;[a]s a leader in forging growth throughout the GTA...&rdquo;as well as a description of industry awards. Page 62 includes images of a number of Liberty projects. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> are the front and back covers of the brochure and pages 61-62.</P>
<P>16. The applicant Ina Cici has advised me and I believe that she received the same glossy brochure at the presentation centre. She also received a letter dated May 17, 2016, a document entitled Mortgage Approval Requirements and a document entitled &ldquo;Cosmos Condominiums RBC Royal Bank working with Liberty Development&rdquo;, which is a solicitation for mortgage financing. These documents are collectively attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>17. The applicant Carla Gravina has advised me and I believe that she received a 48 page glossy brochure with the same references to Liberty Developments as in my brochure. Her brochure came in an envelope where the logo for Liberty Development is prominently displayed. She also received a letter dated February 22, 2017 and a special preview price list. The envelope, letter and price list are attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>18. On the Liberty Development Website, the company provides a company profile which includes a history of its projects and the role of the founders. A print-out of the Company Profile, as of September 13, 2018 is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>19. The Corporate Profile Reports for the four respondents are attached as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;O&rdquo;, &ldquo;P&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD>. The officers and directors of the four respondents are virtually the same. I am advised by Ms. Sander that the searches were conducted on August 1, 2018.</P>
<P>20. Liberty Development is registered with Tarion as an Umbrella Group. As stated by Tarion:
<QUOTE><P>An Umbrella Group is a group of builders sharing at least one common officer, director, principal or partner. It is used by Tarion to identify associated past and current registered builders.</P>
<P>Umbrella Groups are shown in the Builder Directory on Tarion's website to let consumers know other names under which the builder may be operating and the communities in which it builds, and to provide a more complete history of the builder's performance.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> is a description of Umbrella Groups and Liberty Development's profile as an Umbrella Group. 1945086 Ontario Inc. and 1945087 Ontario Inc. are listed as member companies of the Liberty Development Umbrella Group.</P>
<P>21. I am advised by Ms. Sander and believe that Charney Lawyers hired a title search company to conduct an abstract search of title to the lands where the Cosmos Towers were to be constructed. The search was conducted on or about July 26, 2018. According to the search results, the municipal addresses for the project in Vaughan included 190 Maplecrest Road; 2951 Highway7 West; and 180 Maplecrest Road. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;S&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;U&rdquo;</BOLD> are the notes for each search and the abstract.</P>
<P>22. I am advised by Ms. Sander and believe that Charney Lawyers also received a copy of a registered charge/collateral mortgage registered against title to the lands where the project was to be constructed in the amount of 100 million including a Schedule 2 Collateral Mortgage attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;V&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>23. The collateral mortgage refers to an indemnity agreement dated January 13, 2017 between the respondent Vendors and the respondent 1834371 Ontario Inc. By letter dated September 20, 2018 Mr. Charney wrote to counsel requesting a copy of the indemnity agreement and all agreements between Liberty Development Corporation and the respondents. The letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;W&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>24. I understand that the Tarion Addendum to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale includes an arbitration clause at clause 15. The purchasers have concerns about this application proceeding as an arbitration, as set out in a letter sent by Mr. Charney to counsel, dated September 20, 2018, attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;X&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>25. In or about June 2018, Liberty Developments applied to the City of Vaughan for an application to construct a two tower condominium project adjacent to the cancelled Cosmos Tower project at Highway 7 and Maplecrest Road comprised of two towers, 962 units and a seven story mid-rise building. I am aware that a number of the applicants attended the planning committee hearing to voice complaints about this application, Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Y&rdquo;</BOLD> is a media article and an excerpt of the minutes of the Committee meeting dated May 23, 2018.</P>
<P>26. There have also been recent media articles documenting a Liberty Development announcement that it intends to modernize the Promenade Mall in Vaughan construct new buildings on the lands including three residential apartment towers of 8 to 35 stories with 1006 units as well as offices and a hotel with 15.203 square meters of hotel space and 24,392 square meters of office space. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Z&rdquo;</BOLD> is a media article detailing the Liberty Development announcement.</P>
