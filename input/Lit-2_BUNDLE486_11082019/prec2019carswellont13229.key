<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>SUPPLEMENTARY</UNDER> NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE DEFENDANT, TD HOME AND AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY (&ldquo;TD&rdquo;), APPEALS</BOLD> to the Court of Appeal from the Judgment of the Honourable Justice H. McArthur dated December 7, 2018, made at Toronto, granting the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park<UNDER>,</UNDER> summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20<UNDER>;</UNDER> and <STRIKE>determining</STRIKE> <UNDER>on</UNDER> a question of law pursuant to Rule 21 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. Reg. 194.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. That the Judgment dismissing the action as against the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park<UNDER>,</UNDER> be set aside;</P>
<P>2. For a finding that the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park<UNDER>,</UNDER> had possession of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident;</P>
<P>3. For a finding that the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park's<UNDER>,</UNDER> civil liability for the accident is a triable issue;</P>
<P>4. That the Judgment granting the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park costs of the entire action and of the motion<UNDER>s</UNDER> <STRIKE>hereunder</STRIKE> be set aside;</P>
<P>5. That the Appellant be granted costs of this appeal and the <UNDER>underlying</UNDER> motion<UNDER>s</UNDER> <STRIKE>hereunder</STRIKE> inclusive of all taxes and disbursements; and</P>
<P>6. For such further or other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. Justice McArthur erred in law by placing the onus on TD to establish there is no genuine issue requiring a trial when the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park<UNDER>,</UNDER> was the party moving for summary judgment.</P>
<P>2. <UNDER>Justice McArthur erred in law by failing to address the issue of <EM>res judicata</EM>, one of the grounds upon which the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park, moved for summary judgment.</UNDER></P>
<P>3. Justice McArthur erred by not applying the correct law of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint possession&rdquo; of a motor vehicle.</P>
<P>4. Justice McArthur erred in mixed fact and law because she failed to review and consider all of the facts, evidence and case law before her that the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park, had possession of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident<UNDER>.</UNDER> <STRIKE>and is thus a triable issue.</STRIKE></P>
<P>5. <UNDER>Justice McArthur erred in law when using the terms &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, &ldquo;operate&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo; and &ldquo;possession&rdquo; interchangeably.</UNDER></P>
<P>6. <UNDER>Justice McArthur erred in law when using the terms &ldquo;insured&rdquo; and &ldquo;covered&rdquo; interchangeably.</UNDER></P>
<P>7. <UNDER>Justice McArthur erred in law by not finding that Sarah Elizabeth Park's negligence is a triable issue.</UNDER></P>
<P><STRIKE>8. Justice McArthur erred in mixed fact and law by ignoring and/or failing to consider and/or review the factual and evidentiary record before her that the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park could be found at least 1% liable for the motor vehicle accident, and is thus a triable issue.</STRIKE></P>
<P>9. The costs awarded to the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park<UNDER>,</UNDER> are excessive.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. The Judgment appealed from is a final Order of a Judge of the Superior Court of Justice and leave to appeal is not required;</P>
<P>2. Section 6(1)(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990 c.C.43, as amended;</P>
<P>3. Rule 61.04 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. Reg. 194, leave to appeal not being required;</P>
<P>4. The Judgment appealed from is not an Order referred to in subsection 19(1)(a) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990 c.C.43 and no appeal lies to the Divisional Court under another Act; and</P>
<P>5. Such further and other basis of jurisdiction as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPELLANT, TD HOME AND AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant/Appellant, TD Home and Auto Insurance Company (&ldquo;TD&rdquo;), appeals the Judgment of Justice McArthur granting summary judgment to the Defendant/Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park (&ldquo;Sarah Park&rdquo;), pursuant to Rule 20; and on a question of law pursuant to Rule 21 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. Reg. 194. TD also appeals the costs granted to Sarah Park for the underlying motions and action.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 3</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. This action stems from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on August 29, 2013, in the eastbound lanes of Highway 407 near Highway 400 (the &ldquo;accident&rdquo;). Sarah Park was operating her motor vehicle on the highway while engaged in a heated argument with her passenger boyfriend, Giancarlo Hnatiuk. In the course of the argument, Giancarlo Hnatiuk yanked the steering wheel she had control of resulting in a collision with the motor vehicle carrying the plaintiff, Krista McKay, as a passenger.</P>
<P>3. As a result of the accident, Giancarlo Hnatiuk was charged with 9 offences. He pled guilty to 3 offences:
<ITEM><P>Section 249 (3) <EM>Criminal Code</EM>&mdash;unlawfully operating a motor vehicle in a dangerous manner causing bodily harm</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Section 252 <EM>Criminal Code</EM>&mdash;having care, charge or control of a vehicle involved in an accident with intent to escape civil or criminal liability, failing to stop</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Section 145 (3) <EM>Criminal Code</EM>&mdash;breach of recognizance without lawful excuse</P></ITEM></P>
<P>4. Krista McKay brought an action claiming damages for injuries arising from this accident. Sarah Park and Giancarlo Hnatiuk were named defendants in the action. TD was named as a defendant pursuant to the uninsured/underinsured/OPCF-44R provisions of Krista McKay's automobile policy. The provisions provide indemnity in situations where liability for a motor vehicle collision rests with an at-fault party who lacks and/or has insufficient insurance coverage.</P>
<P>5. Sarah Park has refused to accept responsibility for this accident. Her defence has been that at the relevant time, she did not have possession of her motor vehicle because Giancarlo Hnatiuk pled guilty for &ldquo;unlawfully operating a motor vehicle in a dangerous manner causing bodily harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;having care, charge or control of a vehicle involved in an accident.&rdquo; It was her defence that in these circumstances liability could not be re-litigated and <EM>res judicata</EM> applied.</P>
<P>6. TD's position has been that Sarah Park had possession of her motor vehicle at the time of the accident: if she did not have <BOLD><EM>sole</EM></BOLD> possession, she had <BOLD><EM>joint</EM></BOLD> possession. In addition, TD argued that <EM>res judicata</EM> did not apply because Sarah Park's liability for this accident was never considered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Sarah Park was not charged with an offence at the criminal level. No hearing was conducted over her culpability for how this accident occurred. She did not give evidence at any criminal hearing and/or proceeding. She did not give evidence in relation to Giancarlo Hnatiuk's criminal charges. No findings of fact were made by any court regarding her liability for this accident. In short, Giancarlo Hnatiuk's convictions for the accident do not preclude a finding of civil liability on Sarah Park for her own negligence.</P>
<P>7. Justice McArthur presided over the motions. She ruled in favour of Sarah Park. It is TD's position that Justice McArthur made several errors of law that warrant the intervention of this Court.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Onus</TI>
<P>8. Sarah Park was the moving party for the motions. However, Justice McArthur's Endorsement leaves the impression that TD was the moving party. Justice McArthur places the onus on TD to establish that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, when the burden was on Sarah Park, the moving party, to establish that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. Justice McArthur never pronounces that Sarah Park has met this burden. Justice McArthur does not outline what evidence she accepted from the moving party to conclude that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. The reversal of the onus, and the inadequacy of her reasons, are errors of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Possession</TI>
<P>9. Justice McArthur bases her analysis of possession entirely on the criminal case of <CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>1970 CanLII 222</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>. This is an error of law because the law of possession in motor vehicle/insurance litigation is distinct from, and broader than, the concept of possession in the criminal context. Over the years, Courts have adopted an expansive view of what constitutes &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of a motor vehicle in the civil realm. Possession of a motor vehicle is <EM>more</EM> than simply &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the car or touching the steering wheel. Possession of a motor vehicle is <EM>more</EM> than simple interference with control or operation of a vehicle. Possession of a motor vehicle can be determined through ownership of the vehicle, physical presence/occupancy inside the vehicle, control of the vehicle, permission to operate the vehicle, mere custody of the vehicle, and even occasional use of the vehicle.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>1970 CanLII 222</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 1 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. Justice McArthur reduced &ldquo;possession&rdquo; to an analysis of who was &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the motor vehicle at the time of the accident. Justice McArthur focused her analysis of Sarah Park's &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of the motor vehicle on Giancarlo Hnatiuk's act of &ldquo;grabbing the steering wheel&rdquo; and concluded that he did not have &ldquo;consent to drive the car&rdquo;. Justice McArthur disregarded the overwhelming evidence that, despite Giancarlo Hnatiuk's act of grabbing the steering wheel, Sarah Park remained in &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of the vehicle:
<ITEM><P>She was the registered owner of the vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She had the keys to the vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She put the keys into the ignition</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She was in the driver's seat</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She was driving the vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She was operating a manual/standard transmission vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She controlled the gas</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She controlled the brake</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She controlled the speed/gear of the vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She applied the clutch as needed to switch gears</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She had both hands on the steering wheel</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She always had control of the vehicle</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She never changed seats with Giancarlo Hnatiuk</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She tried to maintain control of the steering wheel when Giancarlo Hnatiuk grabbed it</P></ITEM></P>
<P>11. Justice McArthur equates &ldquo;possession&rdquo; with &ldquo;control&rdquo;. She equates &ldquo;driving&rdquo; with the momentary interference from a passenger who simply &ldquo;grabs the steering wheel&rdquo;. Justice McArthur refers to specific terms such as &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, &ldquo;operation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;control&rdquo; in a fluid manner, as if they carry the same meaning, which they do not. By using these terms interchangeably, Justice McArthur demonstrates her understanding of possession to mean who was &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the vehicle, which is an error of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Joint Possession</TI>
<P>12. Justice McArthur failed to consider that two (2) people can be in &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of a motor vehicle at the same time. Justice McArthur did not consider whether Sarah Park and Giancarlo Hnatiuk were in &ldquo;joint possession&rdquo; of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident. Justice McArthur failed to consider the following <EM>indicia</EM> of joint possession:
<ITEM><P>Giancarlo Hnatiuk was seated in the front passenger seat</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park was seated in the driver's seat</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Giancarlo Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel with only one hand</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park held onto the steering wheel with both hands at all times</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park continued to steer the vehicle even after Giancarlo Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park did not let go of the steering wheel</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park was in control of the speed</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park was in charge of the gas pedal</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park was in charge of the clutch</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park remained seated in the driver's seat at all times</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park applied the brakes when the vehicle spun out of control</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Sarah Park tried to maintain control by keeping both hands on the wheel and steering the vehicle back into her lane</P></ITEM></P>
<P>13. Justice McArthur's failure to address this issue and conduct an analysis is an error of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Res Judicata</EM></TI>
<P>14. Justice McArthur did not address the issue of <EM>res judicata</EM> even though this was <EM>one of two grounds</EM> that Sarah Park was relying on for the relief she was seeking. Justice McArthur's failure to conduct the discrete analysis into whether Giancarlo Hnatiuk's guilty plea constituted <EM>res judicata</EM> as it related to Sarah Park's civil liability is an error of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>&ldquo;Covered&rdquo; Under a Policy v. &ldquo;Insured&rdquo; Under a Policy</TI>
<P>15. Sarah Park moved for a declaration that Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; under her motor vehicle policy issued by State Farm; and that Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not entitled to indemnity under the State Farm policy.</P>
<P>16. Terms such as &ldquo;insured&rdquo; and &ldquo;coverage&rdquo; have very specific technical meanings under the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. For example, one can be an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; under a policy, and not be &ldquo;covered&rdquo; by the policy if the person falls under an exclusion. Justice McArthur uses these terms interchangeably throughout her Endorsement. It is an error of law to use these terms interchangeably because they do not mean the same thing.</P>
<P>17. Justice McArthur granted Sarah Park a declaration that Giancarlo Hnatiuk was &ldquo;not covered&rdquo; under the insurance policy. Justice McArthur does not explain how or why Giancarlo Hnatiuk is &ldquo;not covered&rdquo; under Sarah Park's insurance policy. She does not outline which sections of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> and Sarah Park's insurance policy she relied upon to come to her determination. What she does articulate is that a ruling on the summary judgment motion in favour of Sarah Park &ldquo;leads to the inevitable conclusion that Mr. Hnatiuk would not be covered by Ms. Park's insurance.&rdquo; This is wholly inadequate. It makes short shrift of an analysis that is required when a party's personal rights will be affected by the judgment. It falls below the standard of the judiciary to provide clear, transparent, and grounded reasons for decisions.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Negligence</TI>
<P>18. Sarah Park raised very discrete grounds for her summary judgment motions: &ldquo;possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>res judicata</EM>&rdquo;, but <EM>res judicata</EM> in the context of someone else's negligence that had already been determined, not her own. TD highlighted for the Court that not only did <EM>res judicata</EM> not apply, (making her negligence a triable issue), but there was enough evidence available to support the finding that Sarah Park's negligence was a triable issue.</P>
<P>19. Justice McArthur failed to conduct a fulsome or expansive analysis of Sarah Park's negligence. She failed to correctly apply principles of negligence to the facts. She failed to consider evidence from which she could draw reasonable inferences of Sarah Park's negligence. For example, she did not consider the Ministry of Transportation Driver's Guidelines (in evidence before her) that warns against operating a motor vehicle in an emotional state. She failed to consider that Sarah Park put herself and other road users in a situation of danger for operating the motor vehicle while engaged in a heated argument on the highway, contrary to Ministry of Transportation Guidelines. She failed to consider that Sarah Park was an &ldquo;equal participant&rdquo; in the argument while operating the vehicle. She failed to consider that Sarah Park refused to drop the argument and &ldquo;provoked&rdquo; Giancarlo Hnatiuk when she knew that he was capable of violent outbursts and had poor self-control. She failed to make findings that were grounded in the evidence before her; instead, she made findings of fact in the absence of actual evidence when she concluded that Sarah Park was &ldquo;driving safely&rdquo;.</P>
<P>20. Justice McArthur's ruling that Sarah Park's liability for the accident is not a triable issue is an error of law because it was not grounded in the factual/evidentiary matrix that was before her.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>91. The issues on appeal are as follows:
<P1>I. What is the applicable standard of review?</P1>
<P1>II. Did Justice McArthur err by placing the onus on TD to establish there is a genuine issue requiring a trial when the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park, was the party moving for summary judgment?</P1>
<P1>III. Did Justice McArthur err by failing to address the issue of <EM>res judicata</EM> when it was one of two grounds raised by Sarah Park on the motions for the relief she was seeking?</P1>
<P1>IV. Did Justice McArthur err by not applying the correct law of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint possession&rdquo; of a motor vehicle to the facts before her?</P1>
<P1>V. Did Justice McArthur err by using the terms &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, &ldquo;operate&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo; and &ldquo;possession&rdquo; interchangeably in her analysis?</P1>
<P1>VI. Did Justice McArthur err in using the terms &ldquo;insured&rdquo; and &ldquo;covered&rdquo; interchangeably?</P1>
<P1>VII. Did Justice McArthur err by not finding that Sarah Park's negligence was a triable issue?</P1>
<P1>VIII. Were the costs of the motions and action granted to the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park excessive?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART IV&mdash;LAW &amp; ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>I</N><TI>Standard of Review on Appeal</TI>
<P>92. The standard of review on a question of law is correctness. An appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the judge with its own.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33 (CanLII)</CITE><PAGENUM>8</PAGENUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 2 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>93. On issues involving findings of fact, inferences of fact, and questions of mixed fact and law, the standard of review is palpable and overriding error
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 25 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>55 and 302</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 3 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>94. Absent an error of law, the exercise of powers under the new summary judgment rules attract deference. A motion judge's decision that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial is a finding of mixed fact and law. On appeal, it is subject to the standard of &ldquo;palpable and overriding error.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>81</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 4 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>II</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by placing the onus on TD to establish there is a genuine issue requiring a trial when the Defendant, Sarah Park was the party moving for summary judgment</TI>
<P>95. On a summary judgment motion, the moving party <EM>always</EM> has the evidentiary burden of demonstrating there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. Only <EM>after</EM> the moving party has discharged its evidentiary burden of proving there is no genuine issue requiring a trial does the burden shift to the responding party to prove that its claim has a real chance of success.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sanzone v. Schechter</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 566 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>30</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 5 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>96. To place the onus of establishing that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial on a party responding to a summary judgment motion, instead of the moving party, is an error of law and therefore attracts the correctness standard of review.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Royal Bank of Canada v. Soci&ea;t&ea; G&ea;n&ea;rale (Canada)</SOC><CITE>2006 CanLII 42545</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at paras. 9; 35&ndash;37, Tab 6 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>97. Justice McArthur's Endorsement reads as though TD is the party moving for summary judgment. Justice McArthur makes no reference to the evidence or facts advanced by the moving party, Sarah Park, in support of her finding that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. Rather, Justice McArthur simply notes where she disagrees with the arguments advanced by TD, the responding party. For example, at paragraphs 20 and 29 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur outlines TD's position, but she does not state whether Sarah Park first discharged her burden to prove there was no genuine issue requiring a trial before moving on to TD' arguments.
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at paras. 20 and 29, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4, pg 18-19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>98. TD submits that paragraphs 20 and 29 of the Endorsement illustrate that Justice McArthur reversed who had the onus to prove that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. This error of law tainted the proper determination of the summary judgment motion.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>III</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by not addressing whether res judicata applied vis-&ag;-vis Sarah Park</TI>
<P>99. Judges must give reasons that allow the parties to know that their claims have been heard, understood and adjudicated upon in an objective and reasonable fashion that accord with the applicable legal principles. On an appeal based on the judge's failure to give reasons, the appellate court must measure the adequacy of the reasons against the requirement that the reasons permit meaningful appellate review of the decision. If the reasons serve that function, any shortcomings from a due administration of justice perspective, do not justify appellate intervention. However, reasons that frustrate meaningful appellate review constitute an error in law. That error requires the quashing of the verdict unless the trial record as a whole permits effective appellate review of the verdict.

<P>100. Where the record, including the reasons for judgment, disclose a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly a complete disregard of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede.

<P>101. Justice McArthur was obliged to address one of the two substantive grounds upon which Sarah Park sought summary judgment: <EM>res judicata</EM>. However, there is a complete absence of any analysis with respect to this ground. There is no consideration or mention of this issue. There is no analysis as to whether <EM>res judicata</EM> applied to preclude a finding of civil liability vis-&ag;-vis Sarah Park. Although Justice McArthur goes on to discuss Sarah Park's lack of civil liability for the accident, it is unclear how she arrived at that determination when she failed to address the threshold issue of <EM>res judicata</EM>. The complete absence of this discussion highlights the inadequacy of her reasons.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>IV</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by not applying the correct law of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint possession&rdquo; of a motor vehicle to the facts before her</TI>
<P>102. The onus of proving that a vehicle on a highway was in another's possession without the consent of the vehicle's owner is on the owner.

<P>103. In motor vehicle litigation, &ldquo;consent to possession of a vehicle is not synonymous with consent to operate it. Public policy considerations reinforce the importance of maintaining that distinction.&rdquo;

<P>104. In <CASEREF><SOC>Seegmiller v. Langer</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>2008 CanLII 53138</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 34, Justice Strathy confirmed the following propositions as he summarized the law of possession in relation to motor vehicle accidents:
<QUOTE><P>1. The question of whether a motor vehicle is in the possession of some person without the consent of the owner is a question of fact to be determined by the evidence in a particular case: <CASEREF><SOC>Henwood v. Coburn et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, above, at para. 25; <CASEREF><SOC>Thorne v. Prets</SOC><CITE>2003 CanLII 22084</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[2003] O.J.

<P>2. The meaning of possession is a question of law but the application of that definition to any particular set of facts is not a question of law alone: <CASEREF><SOC>Henwood v. Coburn et al.</SOC></CASEREF> above.</P>
<P>3. Possession is a concept capable of different meanings and there are different types of possession. The primary definition of possession contemplates power, control or dominion over property: see <EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM>, (8th ed., 2004).</P>
<P>4. Once ownership of a vehicle is established, the onus passes to the owner to establish that the vehicle was, without the consent of the owner, in the possession of some person other than the owner: see <CASEREF><SOC>Ross v. Vayda</SOC><YEAR>1990</YEAR><CITE>1990 CanLII 8082</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>40 O.A.C. 149</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1990] O.J. No. 1583</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>5. The owner's vicarious liability under s. 192 is based on possession, as opposed to operation of the vehicle: see <CASEREF><SOC>Thompson v. Bourchier</SOC></CASEREF>, above; <CASEREF><SOC>Finlayson v. GMAC Leaseco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, above.</P>
<P>6. &ldquo;[C]onsent to possession of a vehicle is not synonymous with consent to operate it. Public policy considerations reinforce the importance of maintaining that distinction&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Finlayson v. GMAC Leaseco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, at para. 3.</P>
<P>7. If possession is given, the owner will be liable even if there is a breach of a condition attached to that possession, including a condition that the person in possession will not operate the vehicle: <CASEREF><SOC>Finlayson v. GMAC Leaseco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Donald v. Huntley Service Centre Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1987</YEAR><CITE>1987 CanLII 4199</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>61 O.R.

<P>8. Breach of conditions placed by the owner on a person's possession of the vehicle, including conditions as to who may operate the vehicle, do not alter the fact of possession: <CASEREF><SOC>Thompson v. Bourchier</SOC></CASEREF>, above; <CASEREF><SOC>Finlayson v. GMAC Leaseco Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, above.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Seegmiller v. Langer</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>2008 CanLII 53138</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, at para. 34, Tab 11 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>105. At paras. 40&ndash;43 of <CASEREF><SOC>Henwood v. Coburn</SOC><YEAR>2006</YEAR><CITE>2006 CanLII 27869</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the Court held that the definition of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; in the context of &ldquo;possession of a motor vehicle&rdquo; should not be overly restrictive by not considering the possibility of &ldquo;joint possession&rdquo; or &ldquo;constructive possession.&rdquo; The Court further held that <UNDER>occupation</UNDER> of the vehicle demonstrated continued assertion to possession of the vehicle. In <CASEREF><SOC>Sikora v. Brown</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 30</CITE></CASEREF> <UNDER>(CanLII)</UNDER>, the British Columbia Supreme Court apportioned liability equally between a driver and interfering passenger, implying that both the driver and passenger had possession of the vehicle at the time of the accident.

<P>106. Section 192(1) of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM> imposes direct liability on drivers that are negligent in their <UNDER>operation</UNDER> of a motor vehicle. Section 192(2) of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM> imposes vicarious liability on a vehicle owner for damage caused by the negligent <UNDER>operation</UNDER> of a motor vehicle when it is in the <UNDER>possession</UNDER> of another person without the owner's consent. Section 192(1) and 192(2) of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM> states:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>192.</N>
<SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>The driver of a motor vehicle or street car is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle or street car on a highway.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>The owner of a motor vehicle or street car is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle or street car on a highway, unless the motor vehicle or street car was without the owner's consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or the owner's chauffeur.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c H.8, s. 192, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; of Factum of the Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>107. At paragraph 22, Justice McArthur equates Giancarlo Hnatiuk's intereference with Sarah Park's operation of the vehicle as taking possession. Examples of Sarah Park's custody of the vehicle, including ownership, occupation of the vehicle, control of the vehicle, and physicial presence in the vehicle are dismissed because according to her Honour, they are <BOLD>&ldquo;of no moment&rdquo;</BOLD>. This is an error of law because having custody of the vehicle is to have &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of that vehicle.
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 22, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>108. At paragraph 7 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur states that &ldquo;Giancarlo Hnatiuk did not have consent to <UNDER>drive</UNDER> Sarah Park's car&rdquo;. This is the incorrect legal test to apply to the analysis. Justice McArthur was required to determine whether Sarah Park was in sole <UNDER>possession</UNDER> or joint <UNDER>possession</UNDER> of the vehicle not whether Giancarlo Hnatiuk had her consent to drive the vehicle.
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 7, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>109. Justice McArthur erred by not addressing the submissions, arguments, or cases before her regarding the law of possession as it relates to Section 192(2) of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM>. She relies almost exclusively on the criminal case of <CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>1970 CanLII 222</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, submitted by counsel for Sarah Park. However, <EM>B&ea;langer</EM> does not apply to this matter because <EM>B&ea;langer</EM> deals with a charge of criminal negligence, not whether the passenger took possession of the vehicle.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>1970 CanLII 222</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>110. TD submits that the framework for the vicarious liability analysis provided in Section 192(2) is not the operative legal test to apply in this case because Sarah Park, the owner of the vehicle, was physically present in and operating the vehicle. She was therefore in possession of the vehicle in her own right. Alternatively, Sarah Park had joint possession of the vehicle with Giancarlo Hnatiuk</P>
<P>111. TD submits that Justice McArthur erred in law by failing to apply the correct legal principles with respect to possession and joint possession of a motor vehicle to the facts. She failed to review and discuss the seminal cases on possession before her. She failed to provide fulsome and legally correct reasons grounded in the law and evidentiary record.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>V</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by using the terms &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, &ldquo;operate&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo;, and &ldquo;possession&rdquo; interchangebly in her analysis</TI>
<P>112. The terms, &ldquo;possession&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo;, &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, and &ldquo;operator&rdquo; cannot be used interchangeably because they each have specific meaning established by both case law and the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. Conflating them, and/or using them in a fluid manner, is an error of law which attracts the correctness standard of review. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Milligan v. Dryburgh et al</SOC><CITE>[1985] I.L.R. para. 1-1960</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1985] O.J. No. 527</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> the Court found that a passenger of an automobile who reaches over and grabs the steering wheel is <UNDER>not</UNDER> involved in the &ldquo;ownership, use or operation of the said vehicle&rdquo;.

<P>113. An owner's vicarious liability under s. 192(2) of the <EM>Highway Traffic Act</EM> is based on possession, not operation of the vehicle. This is a critical distinction.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Thompson v. Bourchier</SOC><CITE>1933 CanLII 106</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 15 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>114. At paragraph 7 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur states that &ldquo;...he did not have her consent to <UNDER>drive</UNDER> the car.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 22, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>115. At paragraph 22 of the Endorsement, after quoting a passage from <CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>1970 CanLII 222</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> where the Court found that &ldquo;he was solely responsible for the dangerous <UNDER>driving</UNDER> of the cruiser...&rdquo; Justice McArthur states that &ldquo;In doing so, he (Giancarlo Hnatiuk) took control of the car&rdquo;.

<P>116. At paragraph 24 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur acknowledged that the Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Momney et al. v. The Queen in right of Ontario et al.</SOC><CITE>1971 CanLII 580</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> found the officer &ldquo;was in <UNDER>possession</UNDER> of the car&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<UNDER>operation</UNDER> of the vehicle was being done by&rdquo; the officer, but she held that was inconsequential because he was ultimately found not liable. She then considers that case to support the moving party's position that Sarah Park was not liable because &ldquo;she did not have <UNDER>control</UNDER> of the car when Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed the wheel without her consent.&rdquo;

<P>117. These examples demonstrate that Justice McArthur committed errors of law when conflating and/or using these terms interchangeably. These examples also demonstrate that her focus was on &ldquo;driving&rdquo; and not on &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of the motor vehicle, which is an error of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>VI</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred in using the terms &ldquo;insured&rdquo; and &ldquo;covered&rdquo; interchangeably</TI>
<P>118. To be an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; under a policy is different than being &ldquo;covered&rdquo; under a policy. Justice McArthur makes no findings as to whether Giancarlo Hnatiuk is an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; under Sarah Park's policy. She simply concludes that he is not &ldquo;covered&rdquo;, which was not the required analysis.</P>
<P>119. Insurance policies are statutory contracts. When interpreting legislation, courts must take into account the meaning of the legislation, in its total context.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Simison (Litigation guardian of) v. Catlyn</SOC><CITE>2004 CanLII 22313</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para. 14, Tab 17 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>120. In <CASEREF><SOC>Kahlon v. ACE INA Insurance</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 784 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>63-64</PARANUM></CASEREF>, the Court demonstrates basic principles to determining coverage. First, a determination as to whether one is an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; must take place. Then, the question of coverage is determined.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kahlon v. ACE INA Insurance</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 784</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD><UNDER>(CanLII)</UNDER>, Tab 18 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>121. In order to make a determination pursuant to Rule 21, Justice McArthur was first required to address whether or not Giancarlo Hnatiuk was an &ldquo;insured&rdquo; under Sarah Park's policy. She was then required to determine whether or not Sarah Park's insurer, State Farm, owed Giancarlo Hnatiuk any indemnity obligations. However, Justice McArthur, simply concludes that Giancarlo Hnatiuk was not &ldquo;covered&rdquo; under Sarah Park's policy.</P>
<P>122. Justice McArthur does not refer to which sections of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> or which specific sections of Sarah Park's automobile policy she relies upon in coming to her determination. There is no finding as to whether or not Giancarlo Hnatiuk is an &ldquo;insured&rdquo;, which is a preliminary issue that should have been determined in her Rule 21 analysis. There is no analysis leading up to the conclusion that &ldquo;Mr. Hnatiuk would not be covered by Ms. Park's insurance.&rdquo; There is only a reference that her ruling in Sarah Park's favour on the summary judgment motion leads to the &ldquo;inevitable conclusion that Mr. Hnatiuk would not be covered by Sarah Park's insurance.&rdquo; This decision is inadequate in both its analysis and reasons. It is not based in law, or on an actual interpretation of the terms in Sarah Park's insurance policy.

<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>VII</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by not finding that Sarah Park's negligence was a triable issue</TI>
<P>123. Justice McArthur attempted a negligence analysis that was not successful.</P>
<P>124. Justice McArthur gives little consideration to the fact that Sarah Park placed herself and others in a situation of danger while operating a motor vehicle on a high speed highway engaged in a heated argument. There is no analysis as to whether Sarah Park contravened the Ministry of Transportation's Driver Manual, warning against driving in an emotional or upset state.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Jennifer Sweitzer, at paras. 43&ndash;45 and Exhibits L and M, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 13, pg 229 - 230</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>125. There is no analysis as to whether Sarah Park's admitted emotional turmoil and stress were a breach of the standard of care, even though this Court has stated that merely having something on one's mind while operating a vehicle can constitute distracted driving.

<P>126. At paragraph 34 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur states:
<QUOTE><P>[34] Up until the point that Mr. Hnatiuk suddenly and impulsively grabbed the wheel, <UNDER>there is no question that Ms. Park was driving in a safe manner</UNDER>. <UNDER>Given the safe manner of her driving</UNDER>, but for the unexpected action of Mr. Hnatiuk in grabbing the wheel, the accident would not have occurred, [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 34, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4, pg 6, pg 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>127. Justice McArthur claims that Sarah Park was driving safely because &ldquo;She was not exceeding the speed limit. She was not tailgating. She was not veering in her lane.&rdquo; However, Justice McArthur does not address or consider that Sarah Park was operating the vehicle in an emotionally charged enclosed space, engaged in a heated argument she would not let go of; and that she continued to needle Giancarlo Hnatiuk, even after he stopped arguing, closed his eyes, and lay back in his seat.
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 36, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4, pg 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>128. Justice McArthur failed to consider the volatile atmosphere inside the vehicle. There was overwhelming evidence to reasonably infer that Sarah Park was distracted. She was emotional. She was arguing. She was an equal participant in the argument. She was stressed out. She was exchanging expletives with Giancarlo Hnatiuk. They were raising their voices at each other. She was saying things that were upsetting Hnatiuk and he was operating in kind. She would not let go of the argument, even after Hnatiuk lay back in his seat and closed his eyes. Justice McArthur does not conduct an analysis into how this emotionally charged atmosphere would impact Sarah Park's state of mind while operating the motor vehicle on a high speed highway,</P>
<P>129. Justice McArthur failed to recognize that Sarah Park created a situation of danger to herself and to other road users by operating her motor vehicle while engaged in a heated argument with an individual she knew had poor impulse control and anger issues. Justice McArthur does not discuss the intensity and duration of the argument that Sarah Park and Giancarlo Hnatiuk were engaged in while she was driving on the highway. She disregards the fact that Sarah Park knew Giancarlo Hnatiuk to be impulsive with poor behavioural control. Justice McArthur disregards the fact that just 2 months before the car accident an angry Giancarlo Hnatiuk committed an abusive act upon Sarah Park leaving her with bruises and resulting in criminal charges and a no contact order.</P>
<P>130. Justice McArthur misapprehended the test for reasonable foreseeability when she concluded that it was not reasonably foreseeable Giancarlo Hnatiuk would grab the steering wheel. At paragraph 32 of the Endorsement, her Honour states that &ldquo;he never attempted to grab the steering wheel before&rdquo;. This approach is too narrow. Reasonable foreseeability is an objective test. Justice McArthur should have considered whether it was reasonably foreseeable Giancarlo Hnatiuk would react in a physical/impulsive way when angry.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Rankin (Rankin's Garage &amp; Safes) v. J.J.</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 19 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 20 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 32, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4, pg 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>131. The evidence before Justice McArthur should have led to a determination that it was reasonably foreseeable Giancarlo Hnatiuk would react impulsively/violently in the context of a heated argument, causing injury to other drivers on the road.</P>
<P>132. Justice McArthur failed to address causation of the accident. Justice McArthur does not canvass Sarah Park's admission that she caused Giancarlo Hnatiuk to react as he did. She does not discuss the implication of Sarah Park's admission that she was an equal participant in the argument. She does not consider the evidence/admissions made by Sarah Park at discovery and on cross-examination regarding her role in provoking Giancarlo Hnatiuk. Further, Justice McArthur does not consider whether Sarah Park's actions materially contributed to the accident. The arguments advanced by TD on these issues are entirely omitted from Justice McArthur's analysis.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>VIII</N><TI>The costs of the motions and action granted to the Defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park were excessive</TI>
<P>133. Justice McArthur granted Sarah Park costs for the motions and the action in the amount of $50,000.00, payable by TD.
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated February 6, 2019 at para. 6, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 5, pg 29</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>134. A cost award should be set aside on appeal if the judge made an error in principle or if the costs award was plainly wrong.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2004 SCC 9 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 21 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>135. In <CASEREF><SOC>Young v. Young</SOC><CITE>1993 CanLII 34</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at page 134, Justice McLachlin (as she then was) writing for the majority, held that solicitor-and-client costs &ldquo;are generally awarded <EM>only</EM> where there has been reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of one of the parties.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Young v. Young</SOC><CITE>1993 CanLII 34</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>, Tab 22 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>136. While awarding costs is a discretionary exercise, attracting a high level of deference, awards must be given on a principled basis. Otherwise, appellate courts can intervene.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Fraleigh</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 555 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>., Tab 23 of BOA of Appellant</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>137. The quantum of costs should reflect an amount the court considers to be fair and reasonable rather than any exact measure of the actual costs to the successful litigant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier</SOC><CITE>2002 CanLII 25577</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para. 4, Tab 24 of BOA of Appellant.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>138. Justice McArthur erred in awarding Sarah Park costs for the motion and for the entire action because 1) The costs do not reflect the usual and customary costs that a party would expect to pay on such a motion; 2) TD did not bring Sarah Park into the action and 3) regardless of TD's involvement, Sarah Park would have had to attend and complete examinations for discovery at the request of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>139. At paragraph 45 of the Endorsement, Justice McArthur factors TD's participation in examinations for discovery into her costs award. She also states that TD was &ldquo;involved in much of the litigation&rdquo;. Outside of attending for examinations for discovery, Justice McArthur fails to provide sufficient and adequate examples of what &ldquo;much of the litigation&rdquo; she is referring to in support of a $50,000 costs award. Other than attending discoveries and the summary judgment motion, there was no other evidence before her to make a finding of &ldquo;much of the litigation&rdquo;,
<P1><BOLD>Endorsement of Justice McArthur, dated December 7, 2018 at para. 22, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellant, Tab 4 pg 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>140. TD submits that Sarah Park would have proceeded to examinations for discovery whether or not TD participated in the litigation. To apply this factor in her costs decision was an error in principle.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;NATURE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><P1>1. This action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on Highway 407 eastbound near Woodbine Avenue at approximately 7:30 p.m. on August 29, 2013.</P1>
<P1>2. At that time, the defendant/Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park was driving eastbound in the left hand lane of Highway 407 and the defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk, who was her boyfriend at the time was seated in the front passenger seat, when suddenly and without warning the defendant, Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel turning it sharply to the right into the adjacent eastbound lane of Highway 407 causing her vehicle to collide with a pickup truck in which the plaintiff Krista McKay was a front seat passenger, resulting in her sustaining personal injuries.</P1>
<P1>3. The defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park was the named insured under a standard government approved OAP-1 Ontario automobile policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company which provided coverage to her subject to its terms and conditions.</P1>
<P1>4. Contrary to paragraph 2 of the Overview in the Factum of the Appellants, there was no heated argument in progress at the time. There had been an earlier argument which had abated and Hnatiuk was lying back in his seat with his eyes shut when suddenly and without warning in response to a comment by the Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park, he deliberately and intentionally grabbed the steering wheel and turned the vehicle into the oncoming lane while the vehicle was moving at highway speed.</P1>
<P1>5. The Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park in her Statement of Defence and Crossclaim pleaded that she had been in possession of and driving her motor vehicle in a careful, lawful and prudent manner when at the relevant time the co-defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk, suddenly and without warning took possession and control of her vehicle by grabbing the steering wheel causing it to go out of control and collide with the vehicle in which the plaintiff Krista McKay was a passenger, without her consent.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Compendium</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Exhibit E to Affidavit of Samantha Higgins, Tab 2E, pages 43&ndash;47</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>6. As such, it is the position of the Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park that she is not vicariously liable as owner of the vehicle, for the actions of the defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk, which actions were the sole cause of the collision giving rise to the damages claimed in this lawsuit and that the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not an insured under her policy in respect of any claims made by either the plaintiffs or the Appellant TD Home and Auto against Hnatiuk arising from the subject accident.</P1>
<P1>7. The defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk was denied coverage by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in respect of the automobile policy issued by them to Sarah Elizabeth Park. He has not defended the allegations made by Sarah Elizabeth Park that he was in possession of her vehicle at the relevant time without her consent. The defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk represented by counsel pled guilty to and was convicted by a criminal Court of competent jurisdiction of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to Section 249(3) of the Criminal Code and of being <BOLD>the person</BOLD> having care and control of a vehicle involved in an accident with another vehicle on Highway 407 eastbound, who in an attempt to escape civil or criminal liability failed to stop his vehicle, give his name and address and offer assistance, contrary to Section 252(i) of the Criminal Code.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Respondent's Compendium Tab 2G, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; to the Affidavit of Samantha Higgins, pages 51&ndash;57</BOLD></P1>
<P1>8. The Appellant TD Home and Auto Insurance Company insured the plaintiff Krista McKay at the relevant time pursuant to an OAP-1 standard form Ontario automobile policy which provided therein uninsured as well as OPCF-44R underinsured motor coverage to the plaintiff Krista McKay for which they received a premium. The Appellant does not dispute its policy would provide coverage to the plaintiffs if there is no liability on the part of the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park. The Appellant TD Home and Auto Insurance Company has specifically denied in their Statement of Defence and Crossclaim that the accident was caused by the negligence of the operator of an uninsured or underinsured automobile and that both the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park and Giancarlo Hnatiuk were covered by a valid policy of insurance (i.e. the OAP-1 standard form automobile policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company to the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Appellant's Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8 Pages 45&ndash;59</BOLD></P1>
<P1>9. It is acknowledged that the defendant Sarah Elizabeth Park was an insured under the standard automobile OAP-1 policy provided to her by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company providing her with third party liability coverage, but it is submitted that the Judge below was correct based on mixed findings of fact and law that the Respondent has a complete defence based on Giancarlo Hnatiuk taking possession and control of her vehicle at the relevant time without her consent, to which the Judge below, is entitled to be afforded deference and which should not be overturned unless there has been an overriding and palpable error in granting summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20, dismissing the action against the defendant Sarah Elizabeth Park with costs.</P1>
<P1>10. Contrary to the reference in paragraph 5, 14 and 18 of the Appellant's Overview, it is wrongfully suggested that the Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park had argued <EM>res judicata</EM> before the Judge below. No such argument was made either in the written Factum delivered on behalf of the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park or during the course of oral arguments and it is noteworthy is that there is no reference whatsoever to <EM>res judicata</EM> anywhere in the 9 page Endorsement of the Judge below.</P1>
<P1>11. What was argued with reference to the importance and effect to be given to the acceptance of the guilty pleas by a Court of competent jurisdiction entered into with the full knowledge and consent of the defendant Hnatiuk through his lawyer, was not that there was <EM>res judicata</EM> which the Respondent agrees has no application, but rather an abuse of process in attempting to re-litigate the meaning and effect of the prior criminal convictions, which was referenced in the Factum of the Respondent before the Judge below and in oral argument, and will be referred to in Part III and IV of this Factum.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Compendium, at Tab 3, pages 114&ndash;119</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Original Factum of the Respondent as moving party which was before the Judge below, at pages 11&ndash;16</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>12. As mentioned in paragraph 33 of the above reference the position of the moving party was that there was either issue estoppel or an abuse of process (not res judicata) preventing any responding party from attempting to re-litigate the issue of whether the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk was driving the Sarah Elizabeth Park motor vehicle dangerously at the relevant time <BOLD>or to re-litigate that he was the person having the care and control of the vehicle at the relevant time</BOLD>. Only the issue of abuse of process based on the case law referred to which will also be referred to in Part III and IV of this Factum was the subject of oral argument by the moving party.</P1>
<P1>13. Contrary to paragraph 8 of the Overview contained in the Appellant's Factum with respect to <BOLD>Onus,</BOLD> it is the position of the Respondent that there is no basis for suggesting that the Judge below reversed the onus in the bringing of the motion for summary judgment, to place the onus on the Appellant TD Home and Auto to establish that there was a genuine issue requiring a trial. The Judge below had before her the Motion Record and considered a 25 page Factum of the moving party, citing authorities in support of their position that there was no triable issue and that summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20 should be granted as well hearing the oral submissions made by the moving party based on same, before hearing the responding submissions to that oral argument made by the Appellant.</P1>
<P1>14. In her Endorsement, the Judge below implicitly accepted the position as set out in the above documentation and oral submissions of the moving party as making out a prima facie case, and then proceeded to address point by point, why based on her view of the facts and law she was rejecting the responding position of the Appellant with respect to the relief sought by the moving party. This does not constitute a reversal of onus in any way. The Judge below was simply considering the Appellant's response to the arguments that had been made by the Respondent as moving party as to why there was no genuine issue for trial as put forth in the written and oral submissions which she had before her. It was not incumbent upon the Judge below to repeat every argument contained therein in her Endorsement.</P1>
<P1>15. With respect to paragraphs 8&ndash;12 of the Overview section of the Appellant's Factum, the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park disputes that the Judge below did not thoroughly consider the issue of possession as distinct from driver and the issue of joint possession and in fact devotes several paragraphs of her Endorsement to deal with the issue of possession, The Judge below specifically refers to what is submitted is the binding authority put before her by the Respondent being <CASEREF><SOC>Belanger v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>, which she quotes at paragraph 21 of her Endorsement. Moreover, it is the position of the Respondent that the issue of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; is a mixed question of fact and law and that the conclusion of the Judge below as set out in her Endorsement is to be afford deference by this Court and only disturbed if there has been a palpable and overriding error in her ultimate conclusion.</P1>
<P1>16. It is submitted that reading the Endorsement as a whole there is no palpable and overriding error in the conclusion of the Judge below which would warrant interference by this Court.</P1>
<P1>17. With respect to paragraph 18 of the Overview section of the Appellant's Factum, aside from the fact that res judicata is a non issue that was never argued by the Respondent and hence not considered by the Judge below in her Endorsement, the Endorsement made reference to all of the material facts surrounding the issue raised by the Appellant with respect to potential contributory negligence on the part of the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park and rejected same in paragraphs 29&ndash;37 of her Endorsement.</P1>

<P1>18. It is the position of the Respondents that these findings which are based on a mixed question of fact and law are to be afforded deference.</P1>
<P1>19. With respect to the issue of <BOLD>&ldquo;covered&rdquo;</BOLD> under a policy v. <BOLD>&ldquo;insured&rdquo;</BOLD> under a policy, set out in paragraph 15 of the overview in the Appellant's Factum, while the Judge below used the lay term &ldquo;not covered&rdquo; in her determination of the relief sought by the Respondent/moving party, it is important to note that the relief sought was specifically set out in <BOLD>Part VI&mdash;Order Sought</BOLD> of the original Factum before her, which is reproduced at Tab 4 of the Respondent's Compendium. As can be seen the specific relief sought with respect to the Rule 21 motion reads as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>2. A determination pursuant to Rule 21 that the defendant, Giancarlo is not an insured or entitled to indemnity under the Sarah Elizabeth Park automobile policy in respect of any claims advanced against him in this action.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>3. A determination pursuant to Rule 21 that the provisions of Section 258 of the Insurance Act, S.O. 1990, c.I.8 are inapplicable to the automobile policy insuring the vehicle of the defendant Sarah Elizabeth Park (in respect of) any claim asserted for judgment obtained against the defendant, Giancarlo Hnatiuk.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>4. Costs of the Rule 21 motion against any responding parties.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>20. While the Judge below may have used the imprecise term &ldquo;not covered&rdquo; in her determination of the Rule 21 motion, it is apparent from any reasonable interpretation of her Endorsement that it was her intention to grant the specific relief sought with costs.</P1>
<P1>21. As can be seen from the Endorsement of the Judge below, at paragraphs 39&ndash;42, her intention was to allow the specific relief sought by the Respondent/moving party pursuant to Rule 21.01(a) and in fact <BOLD>she so states in paragraph 42.</BOLD></P1>
<P1>22. It is the position of the Respondent based on the findings of fact and law made by the Judge below, that it follows that the defendant, Hnatiuk, is not an insured under the Sarah Elizabeth Park automobile policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in respect of any judgment that may be obtained against him by any party as a result of the subject accident and that in her mind the term &ldquo;not covered&rdquo; was one and the same with not being an insured under the policy. It was clearly her intention to put an end to any further litigation that might be brought pursuant to Section 258 of the Insurance Act or otherwise.</P1>

<P1>26. Until Giancarlo Hnatiuk suddenly grabbed the steering wheel and jerked it into the adjoining lane, into a collision with the vehicle in which the plaintiff Krista McKay was a passenger, the Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park had been proceeding uneventfully with the flow of traffic entirely within the left-hand eastbound lane.</P1>

Moreover, this evidence was confirmed in the sworn evidence of the plaintiff, Krista McKay on her examination for discovery with respect to these observations.</P1>

<P1>29. The judge below found as a fact that in the case before her the overwhelming evidence was that Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel suddenly, impulsively and without Ms. Park's consent, and that in so doing, he took control of the car. The Judge below further concluded that the fact that Ms. Park owned the car, had been driving it immediately before Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed the wheel and had access to the brake and gas pedals, is of no moment because when Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed he wheel he took control of the car without Ms. Park's consent.</P1>

<P1>31. The Judge below found as a fact that up until the point that Mr. Hnatiuk suddenly and impulsively grabbed he wheel there is no question that Ms. Park was driving in a safe manner, and that given the safe manner of her driving, but for the unexpected action of Mr. Hnatiuk in grabbing the wheel, the accident would not have occurred.</P1>

<P1>33. The entire event between the Respondent and Elizabeth Park driving uneventfully in the flow of traffic at Highway speed and the defendant, Hnatiuk grabbing the steering wheel and turning the vehicle into the adjoining lane into a collision with the vehicle in which the plaintiff Krista McKay was a passenger happened very fast, within a couple of seconds and was out of control of the Respondent, Sarah Elizabeth Park.</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;Position of The Respondent with Respect to Issues Raised by the Appellant</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Standard of Review on Appeal</TI>
<P><P1>37. The position of the Respondent is that the Endorsement of the Judge below is based on mixed questions of fact and law, both with respect to consent to possession of the Respondent's vehicle by the defendant Hnatiuk at the relevant time and with respect to the issue raised by the Appellant with respect to contributory negligence on the part of Sarah Elizabeth Park, both of which were rejected.</P1>
<P1>38. As such, the findings and conclusions of the Judge below are entitled to deference and should not be disturbed unless there has been an overriding and palpable error.</P1>

<P1>39. It is submitted on behalf of the Respondent that applying the standards of deference and palpable and overriding error to the Endorsement of the Judge below, there is no basis for interference with same.</P1></P>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>II</N><TI>Submission by the Appellant that Justice McArthur erred by placing the onus on TD to establish there is a genuine issue requiring a trial when the defendant Sarah Park was the party moving for summary judgment.</TI>
<P><P1>40. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Judge below placed the onus on TD to affirmatively establish that there was a genuine issue for trial. There is no such suggestion contained in her Endorsement and she had before her for consideration a 25 page factum of the moving party/Respondent Sarah Elizabeth Park setting out her position as to why there was no genuine issue for trial and why summary judgment was appropriate, as well as a Book of Authorities supporting that position. As is usual, the moving party made oral submissions in advance of the response by the Appellant to those submissions, which set out why there was no genuine issue for trial. It was not necessary for the Judge below to specifically refer to all of the arguments put forth in support of the motion for summary judgment by the moving party, Sarah Elizabeth Park, nor to refer specifically to each of the arguments made. It was perfectly proper for her to focus on the responding argument of the Appellant as to why the submissions made in support of the motion by the moving party, that there was no genuine issue for trial should be rejected. In the end result, after considering and commenting upon each of those responding arguments, the Judge below determined that same were without merit.
<P2>The Judge below was not required to specifically refer to the facts advanced by the moving party in its Factum and oral submissions.</P2>
<P2>In a decision of this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Huisman v. MacDonald</SOC><YEAR>2007</YEAR><CITE>O.J. No. 2037</CITE></CASEREF>, Armstrong J.A. in dealing with this issue refers at paragraph 58 and 59 to the Judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Sheppard</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>1 SCR 869</CITE><PARANUM>23 and 26</PARANUM></CASEREF> as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Counsel for Dr. MacDonald supplements his first ground of appeal by relying upon the Judgment of Binnie J. in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Sheppard</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>1 SCR 869</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>He submits that the Trial Judge failed to articulate the thinking process which led to a conclusion and thereby prevented meaningful Appellant review which constitutes error of law.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>
<P2>At paragraph 59 Justice Armstrong quotes Justice Binnie as follows:
<QUOTE><P>In paras 23 and 26 of Sheppard, Binnie J. said:</P>
<P><BOLD>[23] On a more specific level within the confines of the particular case, it is widely recognized that having to give reasons itself concentrates the judicial mind on the difficulties that are presented... The absence of reasons, however, does not necessarily indicate at absence of such concentration. We are speaking here of the articulation of the reasons rather than of the reasoning process itself. The challenge for the Appellate Court is to ensure that the latter has occurred despite the absence or inadequacy, of the former.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>
<P2>Armstrong J. at para 59 also refers to paragraph 26 in <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Sheppard</SOC></CASEREF> as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>[26] The Appellate Court is not given the power to intervene, simply because it thinks the trial Court did a poor job of expressing itself.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>III</N><TI>Justice McArthur erred by not addressing whether res judicata applied vis a vis Sarah Park.</TI>
<P><P1>41. As was stated in paragraphs 10&ndash;12 of the Facts portion of this Factum, the issue of res judicata was never argued or raised by the moving party before Justice McArthur. The position taken by the moving party Sarah Elizabeth Park based on the legal authority relied upon, was not that there was res judicata but rather either an issue estoppel or abuse of process, and in oral submissions the moving party relied only upon abuse of process with respect to an attempt to re-litigate the Criminal Code convictions of the defendant Hnatiuk pursuant to Section 249 (3) and 252(1) of the Criminal Code, and in particular with respect to the accepted plea of guilty under Section 252 of the Criminal Code implicitly acknowledging that Hnatiuk was <BOLD>the person having the care, charge or control of the vehicle which was involved in an accident with another vehicle on Highway 407 E with intent to escape civil or criminal liability failed to stop his vehicle...</BOLD></P1>

<P><P1>42. The Respondent agrees with the reference in paragraph 104 of the Appellant's Factum to <CASEREF><SOC>Seegmiller v.

<P1>43. <BOLD>In addition, Justice Strathy noted in paragraph 34 that possession is a concept capable of different meanings and that there are different types of possession, but that the primary definition of possession contemplates power, control or dominion over property as set out in Black's Law Dictionary (HED 2004).</BOLD></P1>

<P1>44. It is the position of the Respondent that the Endorsement of the Judge below must be read as a whole and that this Court must consider the entirety of the reasons rather than focusing on isolated introductory comments or single sentences extracted from same.
<P2>It is further the position of the Respondent that the Endorsement read as a whole clearly reflects the Judge below was well aware of the distinction between &ldquo;driving&rdquo; and &ldquo;possession&rdquo;.</P2>
<P2>In fact, the Judge below specifically states at paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Endorsement, the following:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>(21) TD argues that Ms. Park was in physical possession of her car at the time of the accident and is thus liable for the accident. In my view, however, the position of TD cannot be reconciled <EM>with</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Belanger v. The Queen</SOC><YEAR>1970</YEAR></CASEREF><BOLD>, a case that is very similar to the present one. There, a police officer who had investigated Mr. Belanger was driving him home. Mr. Belanger grabbed the steering wheel, causing an accident. Ritchie J. writing for the majority of the Court said the following at p. 574:</BOLD>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The fact is that the police cruiser was driven from its own lane directly into the lane reserved for approaching traffic because the Appellant had deliberately grabbed the steering wheel and taken control from the hands of the constable. Under these circumstances, with respect to those who hold a different view I am under the opinion that for the brief period during which the Appellant assumed control, he was solely responsible for the dangerous driving of the cruiser...</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>(22) Similarly, in the present case, the overwhelming evidence is that Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel suddenly, impulsively and without Ms. Park's consent. In so doing, he took control of the car. The fact that Ms. Park owned the car, had been driving it immediately before Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed the wheel and had access to the brake and gas pedal, is of no moment. When Mr. Hnatiuk grabbed the wheel, he took control of the car without Ms. Park's consent.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>

<P1>45. It is the position of the Respondent that the binding authority settling the issue of who had sole control of the vehicle at the relevant time giving rise to the accident has been settled by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Belanger</SOC></CASEREF>, supra, as was submitted by the moving party to the Judge below and as is accurately quoted by the Judge below in her Endorsement in paragraph 21.</P1>
<P1>46. In paragraph 116 of the Appellant's Factum, reliance is placed on the civil decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Momney et al v. The Queen in Right of Ontario</SOC></CASEREF> at Tab 16 of the Appellant's Book of Authorities. As can be noted this decision involved the same accident as <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Belanger</SOC></CASEREF>. The civil trial Judge made his decision without having been provided with the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Belanger</SOC></CASEREF>. After having that decision brought to his attention, the Judge then delivered an Addendum wherein he states that he did not mean to be in conflict with it and proceeds to suggest that there could have been joint possession and control with respect to the same subject accident, contrary to the decision of Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court of Canada at page 4, which clearly states that the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that at the relevant time, that is when the steering wheel was suddenly grabbed by the passenger, causing the accident, it was the passenger who had sole control of the vehicle for that brief period of time.</P1>

<P1>47. At paragraph 112 of the Appellant's Factum, reliance is placed on <CASEREF><SOC>Milligan v. Dryburgh</SOC></CASEREF>. That case involved a unique situation of a passenger attempting to act as a rescuer to prevent an inexperienced driver wandering into the oncoming lane. In addition, this decision relied upon <CASEREF><SOC>Momney v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>, which was incorrectly decided in view of the Supreme Court of Canada authority of <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Belanger</SOC></CASEREF>, with respect to sole control at the relevant time with the person who grabbed the steering wheel.</P1>
<P1>48. None of the decisions relied upon by the Appellant involved a guilty plea by the passenger grabbing the steering wheel to being the person having care and control of the vehicle at the time of the accident as is the situation in the case before this Court.</P1>
<P1>49. At paragraph 105 of the Appellant's Factum reference is made to an Ontario Superior Court decision in Henwood v. Coburn, which cites only that decision and not the decision of this Court which overruled same. The unique facts were that Coburn demanded to be driven to a destination several hours away and when the owner Henwood refused, Coburn took the truck keys and began to drive away. Henwood jumped in the passenger door as the truck began moving and Cobum refused to relinquish possession to Henwood and then crashed the vehicle.
<P2>This Court allowed the appeal from that decision which had concluded on a summary judgment motion Henwood was in possession of the truck simply because he was physically present, and determined that there was a <BOLD>material issue in dispute as to whether Henwood had regained possession</BOLD> of the truck at the time of the crash, given conflicting evidence in that record, which required a trial. There is no such factual dispute in the case before this Court.</P2>

<P1>50. At paragraph 105 of the Appellant's Factum, reliance is placed on a BC trial level decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Sikora v. Brown</SOC></CASEREF> at Tab 13 of the Appellant's Book of Authorities, that case has little to do with the present matter given the fact situation involved, where liability was apportioned between the driver and the passenger, where the driver actually invited the passenger to take hold of the steering wheel to feel vibrations being caused by the high rate of speed at which the vehicle was travelling, which offer was accepted by the passenger and ultimately resulted in an accident. It is respectfully submitted that those facts are completely opposite to the situation in the case at bar where the defendant, Hnatiuk has been found as a fact to have suddenly and without warning grabbed the steering wheel without the consent of the Respondent, resulting in a collision one to two seconds later.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>VI</N><TI>Whether Justice McArthur erred in using the terms &ldquo;insured&rdquo; and &ldquo;covered&rdquo; interchangeably</TI>
<P><P1>51. The Judge below found as a fact that Hnatiuk had taken control of the vehicle by grabbing the steering wheel without the consent of the Respondent Sarah Park, who was the owner of the vehicle. <BOLD>Under these circumstances, the Judge below reached the correct conclusion that Hnatiuk was neither entitled to indemnity nor an insured under the policy since Hnatiuk could only acquire status of an insured either by being listed on the policy or by being in possession of the vehicle at the relevant time with the consent of the owner, although using the lay term &ldquo;not covered&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1>

It is clear that the specific relief sought was before her, which was for a determination that the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not an insured or entitled to indemnity under the Sarah Elizabeth Park automobile policy in respect of the claims advanced against him in this action. It is also clear that she intended to grant that relief as per paragraphs 39&ndash;42 of her Endorsement.</P1>

It is respectfully submitted that while it would have been optimal if the Judge below in granting the motion under Rule 21 had referred specifically to the order being sought rather than adopting the lay language of &ldquo;not covered&rdquo;, which it is submitted is the type of terminology that any member of the public would understand to mean that neither the plaintiff nor any other party to the lawsuit, including the Appellant, would have a claim against the insurance policy of Sarah Elizabeth Park, this was not a material error given the intention of the Judge below as reflected in a reading of her Endorsement as a whole.
<P2>This Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Huisman v. MacDonald</SOC><YEAR>2007</YEAR><CITE>O.J. No. 2037</CITE><PARANUM>54&ndash;57</PARANUM></CASEREF> makes it clear that it is the interpretation of the evidence as a whole as set out in the full Endorsement that is to be considered rather than focusing on only specific paragraphs. At paragraph 56, this Court states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>It would have been preferable if the trial Judge had articulated more clearly the line of reasoning that led to the conclusion. However, is the trial Judge's conclusion so deficient that one can be satisfied that the reasons exhibit palpable and overriding error? I think not. The palpable and overriding error standard of review is an extremely high standard for any Appellant to establish. Iacobucci and Major J.J. in Housen at para 5 observed that the New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) described the meaning of palpable as &ldquo;clear to the mind or plain to see&rdquo;. See also</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>H. L. v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2005] 1 S.C. R. 401</CITE><PARANUM>69</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>, a palpable error to be overriding must discredit the result. See H. L. at para 69:</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>

<P1>54. The Appellant suggests at paragraphs 121 and 122 of its Factum that the reasons given by the Judge below for her determination that Hnatiuk was not covered under the Sarah Park motor vehicle policy was deficient in its analysis such as to require a reversal.
<P2><BOLD>This issue is dealt with in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Husiman v. MacDonald</SOC></CASEREF> <BOLD>supra at paragraph 58&ndash;60 as follows:</BOLD>
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>(ii)</N><TI>Are the reasons for judgment of the trial Judge deficient?</TI>
<P><BOLD>Counsel for Dr. MacDonald supplements his first round of appeal by relying upon the judgment of Binnie J. in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Sheppard</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>1 SCR 869</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>. He submits that the trial Judge failed to articulate the thinking process which led to her conclusion and thereby prevented meaningful Appellant review which constitutes error of law.</BOLD></P>
<P>In paras 23 and 26 of Sheppard, Binnie J. said:</P>
<P><BOLD>[23] On a more specific level, within the confines of a particular case it is widely recognized that having to give reasons itself concentrates the judicial mind on the difficulties that are presented... The absence of reasons however does not necessary indicate an absence of such concentration...</BOLD> We are speaking here of the <BOLD><EM>articulation</EM></BOLD> of the reasons rather than of the reasoning process itself. The challenge for Appellate Court is to ensure that the latter has occurred despite the absence or inadequacy of the former.</P>
<P><BOLD>[26] The Appellate Court is not given the power to intervene simply because the trial Court did a poor job of expressing itself.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>[60] For the reasons already expressed above, I am not able to say that the trial Judge in this case, given her detailed review of the evidence and the relevant law did not engage in the appropriate reasoning process that led to her conclusion.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P2>

<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>VII</N><TI>Allegation by the Appellant that Justice McArthur erred by not finding that Sarah Park's negligence was a triable issue</TI>
<P><P1>55. All of the arguments put forth by the Appellant with respect to this issue in both the facts portion of its Factum and in the submissions made to this Court in paragraph 124&ndash;132 were fully considered by the Judge below in her Endorsement and specifically rejected with contrary findings of fact made, which are entitled to deference.
<P2>The Judge below deals with these same submissions in her Endorsement to which she devotes a separate section entitled:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>(ii) Is there a genuine issue requiring a trial as to whether Ms. Park was contributorily negligent?</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>
<P2>The Judge below then discusses the applicable elements for establishing negligence upon the Respondent with specific references to the appropriate case law and then applies same to her finding of facts, dealing with each of the items raised in the Appellant's Factum and specifically concludes in paragraph 37 of her Endorsement that the record before her entitles her to make the necessary findings of fact and apply the law to those facts.</P2>
<P2>The Judge below is entitled to deference with respect to findings and conclusion with respect to that issue unless there has been a palpable and overriding error.</P2>
<P2>The Respondent submits that there has been no such error.</P2>

<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>VIII</N><TI>Were the costs of the motions and action granted to the defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park excessive?</TI>
<P><P1>56. The Respondent disagrees entirely with the submission at paragraph 138 of the Appellant's Factum that the costs awarded to the Respondent of the two motions under Rule 20 and Rule 21 combined do not reflect the usual and customary costs that a party would expect to pay on such a motion. The fact that TD did not bring Sarah Park into the action is irrelevant given that she was properly included by the plaintiffs as the owner of the vehicle, against whom liability might be asserted: it is noted that the Appellant TD immediately delivered a crossclaim against the Respondent. Moreover, TD participated fully in the productions and examinations for discovery and were required to do so given its crossclaim and position as a party defendant in the Statement of Claim issued by the plaintiffs.</P1>
<P1>57. It is to be noted as per the Endorsement of the Judge below that based on time spent, the claim for partial indemnity costs submitted was in the amount of $85,765.97, inclusive of HST and disbursements. The Judge below then used her discretion to reject the argument that the actual hourly rate charged by senior counsel of $450.00 per hour was reflective of a partial indemnity rate rather than a lawyer and his own client rate, by reason of the volume discount insisted upon in the marketplace by insurers in personal injury litigation, and also deducted 15 hours as time spent with respect to the period before the Appellant had appeared to the action and commenced their defence of same. In so doing the Judge below exercised her discretion to reduce the amount claimed from $85,765.97 inclusive of HST and disbursements to $50,000.00 inclusive of HST and disbursements. The Judge below sets out in detail the legal principles which she applied and properly sets out that an appropriate cost award is not purely a mathematical exercise. The Judge below also specifically notes in paragraph 50 of the Endorsement that she has considered the principle of proportionality set out in Rule 1.04(1)(1) and all of the factors contained in Rule 57.</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;Additional Issues raised by the Respondent</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Additional Issue I</TI></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Is it an established fact in law that the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk was the driver and person having care and control of the Respondent's vehicle at the relevant time?</TI>
<P><P1>61. Although not specifically addressed by the Judge below in her Endorsement, the above issue is raised by the Appellant as Issue III, erroneously referring to the Judge below not addressing whether res judicata applied. As is set out in response to that issue in this Factum at paras. 10 to 12 and 41, what was argued before Justice McArthur was an abuse of process preventing the Appellant from attempting to re-litigate the issue of whether the defendant Hnatiuk was the person driving dangerously <BOLD>and the person having care and control of the Respondent's vehicle</BOLD> at the relevant time contrary to Section 249 (3) of the Criminal Code and Section 252(1) of the Criminal Code respectively, which guilty pleas were accepted and convictions rendered by a Court of competent jurisdiction</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1A, Certificate of Conviction, Exhibit A to Affidavit of Sarah Elizabeth Park</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>62. It is submitted that the law is well established that in the face of an unequivocal guilty plea accepted and convictions rendered by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the essential elements of the offences become an established fact and the issue cannot be re-litigated in a subsequent civil matter, such that it became an established fact that the defendant Hnatiuk was driving and had care and control of the Respondent's vehicle at the relevant time and as such it is submitted was <BOLD>the sole person</BOLD> in possession of the vehicle at the relevant time.</P1>

<P1>63. At paragraph 54 of the majority Supreme Court of Canada decision, in <CASEREF><SOC>Toronto v. Canadian Union of Public Employees</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, supra, Madam Justice Arbour states the following:</BOLD>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>These considerations are particularly apposite when the attempt is made to re-litigate a criminal conviction. Casting doubt over the validity of criminal conviction is a very serious matter. Inevitably, in a case such as this one, the conclusion of the arbitrator has precisely that effect, whether this was intended (page 111) or not. The administration of justice must equip itself with all legitimate means to prevent wrongful convictions and to address any real possibility of such an occurrence after the fact. Collateral attack and re-litigation, however, are not in my view appropriate methods of redress since they inordinately tax the adjudicative process while doing nothing to ensure a more trustworthy result.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P2>At paragraph 56, Madam Justice Arbour goes on to state:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>I am of the view that the facts in this appeal point to the blatant abuse of process that results when re-litigation of this sort is permitted...</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>
<P2>At paragraph 58 Madam Justice Arbour states:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The arbitrator was required as a matter of law to give full effect to the conviction.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P2>

<P1>64. <BOLD>Where there is no credible evidence to show that a guilty plea was anything other than voluntary, the essential elements of the offence to which the guilty plea was made are established and cannot be re-litigated.</BOLD></P1>

<P1>65. The evidence before the Judge below was that the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk represented by counsel agreed that he intentionally grabbed the steering wheel and did not seek to challenge the essential elements of the offence of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code being that he was not only the driver of the vehicle at the relevant time but as per <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Belanger</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, supra</BOLD> the person having care and control of the vehicle at the relevant time, contrary to Section 249 (3), nor that he was the person with care, charge and control of a vehicle or aircraft that is involved in an accident who attempted to escape civil or criminal liability contrary to Section 252(1) of the criminal code.</P1>

<P1>66. It is to be noted that the Judge below found as a fact that the overwhelming evidence was that the defendant Hnatiuk grabbed the steering wheel suddenly, impulsively and without Ms. Park's consent and further that in so doing, he took control of the car. The Judge below also found as a fact that although Ms. Park owned the car and had been driving it immediately before the accident, the fact that she had access to the brake and gas pedal was of no moment because Hnatiuk had control of the car without her consent when he grabbed the steering wheel.
<P2>It is respectfully submitted that it follows that at the relevant time the Respondent was not in a position to exercise any element of possession. One must consider that this vehicle was being driven at highway speed and that the accident on the evidence occurred within one to two seconds.</P2>

<BLOCK3><TI>Additional Issue II&mdash;In the absence of consent, is Giancarlo Hnatiuk an insured under the Sarah Elizabeth Park OAP-1 automobile policy?</TI>
<P><P1>67. It is respectfully submitted that in the absence of consent with possession the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not an insured under the standard OAP-1 automobile policy under which Sarah Park was an insured, since he is not a listed driver under her policy could only acquire the status of an unnamed insured if he was in possession of the vehicle at the relevant time with her consent.</P1>

<BLOCK3><TI>ADDITIONAL ISSUE III&mdash;Does Section 258 of the Insurance Act of Ontario apply to the automobile policy of Sarah Elizabeth Park in respect of this action?</TI>
<P><P1>68. It is clear that the Judge below had before her the specific relief being sought with respect to the Rule 21 motion as set out in <BOLD>Part VI&mdash;Order Sought of the moving party's Factum</BOLD>, which read as follows:
<P2>1. Summary judgment dismissing the action against Sarah Elizabeth Park, with costs on a substantial indemnity basis by any party responding;</P2>
<P2><BOLD>2. A determination pursuant to Rule 21 that the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk is not an insured or entitled to indemnity under the Sarah Elizabeth Park automobile policy in respect of any claims advanced against him in this action;</BOLD></P2>
<P2>3. <BOLD>A determination pursuant to Rule 21 that the provisions of Section 258 of the Insurance Act, RSO 1990, c. I.8 are inapplicable to the automobile policy insuring the vehicle of the defendant, Sarah Elizabeth Park, (in respect of) any claim asserted or judgment obtained against the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk;</BOLD></P2>
<P2>4. Costs of the Rule 21 motion against any responding party;</P2>
<P2>5. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Reference: Respondent's Compendium Tab 4, Page 120</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>69. Paragraph 42 of the Endorsement of the Judge below specifically signals her intention to allow the relief sought on the Rule 21 motion.</P1>
<P1>70. It is respectfully submitted that any claim against the Park automobile policy in respect of the Judgment against Hnatiuk obtained by any party to this action including the Appellant, TD must be based on Hnatiuk being an insured under her policy and in the absence of consent to possession at the relevant time and in the absence of his being a listed driver on the policy, he was clearly not.</P1>

<P1>71. Justice Firestone in <CASEREF><SOC>Brown v. Williamson</SOC></CASEREF>, beginning at paragraph 12 reviews Section 258 of the Insurance Act and the circumstances under which same would apply or not At paragraph 18 he states the following:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Wawanesa is not seeking to defend the claim by relying on the misrepresentation of the named insured. There is no Wawanesa insured. Section 258 therefore is inapplicable.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P2>In doing so he emphasizes the distinction between the decision of this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Campanero v. Kim</SOC></CASEREF> which dealt with whether or not an insurer could avoid liability under Section 258(1) which permits a direct cause of action by &ldquo;<BOLD>any person who has a claim against an insured for which indemnity is provided by the contract&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2>In granting summary judgement based on the principles set out in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Firestone came to the conclusion that Section 258 of the Insurance Act did not apply to a case where there is no insured person against who the claim was being asserted (in the case at bar, the defendant Hnatiuk).</P2></P1>
<P1>72. It is respectfully submitted that on its plain wording, Section 258(1) has no application in circumstances where the defendant Giancarlo Hnatiuk was not a listed insured under the policy and had effectively taken possession of the vehicle at the relevant time without the consent of the Respondent.</P1>
