<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>THE APPELLANT, LEANNE DUSCIO (&ldquo;Leanne&rdquo;), appeals to the Ontario Court of Appeal from the Order of the Commercial List made on October 12, 2018 by the Honourable Justice S.F. Dunphy.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> LEANNE, asks that the Order be varied as follows:
<P1>1. An order setting aside the Judgment against this Appellant in its entirety; and</P1>
<P1>2. Such further relief as the nature of this appeal may require.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:</BOLD>
<P1>1. The Court made inconsistent factual findings in that the court found she had no knowledge of matters involving the dealings by her husband, Antonio Duscio, but later found her liable for and knowing receipt of trust funds, thereby making a palpable and overriding error;</P1>
<P1>2. His Honour misapprehended the law with respect to this Appellant when dealing with the Application of <CASEREF><SOC>Air Canada vs M&amp;L Travel</SOC></CASEREF> by finding her liable.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. Section 6(1) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43;</P>
<P>2. Reasons for Judgment dated October 12, 2018; and</P>
<P>3. No leave to appeal is required.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT</BOLD> requests that this Appeal be heard at Toronto.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPELLANT, LEANNE DUSCIO</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;THE APPELLANT AND THE DECISION APPEALED FROM</TI>
<P>1. This is an appeal by Leanne Duscio (<BOLD>&ldquo;Leanne&rdquo;</BOLD>) from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Dunphy granting judgment against her in the amount of $3 million for knowing assistance in a breach of trust committed by Catan Canada Inc. (<BOLD>&ldquo;Catan&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>2. After hearing the evidence of both self-represented defendants Leanne and her husband Anthony Duscio (<BOLD>&ldquo;Anthony&rdquo;</BOLD>) over the course of one day (17 total days of trial), Justice Dunphy found that Anthony and Leanne stand in a class apart among the other defendants in the action. Leanne's connection to the overall lawsuit was limited to her being married to Anthony, and as found by Dunphy J., Anthony and Eduardo Garcia (<BOLD>&ldquo;Garcia&rdquo;</BOLD>) perpetrated a fraudulent investment scheme to misappropriate the Plaintiff's funds. Leanne had no involvement in the fraudulent scheme, but was listed with the Ministry as a director of one of the corporate vehicles used by her husband to perpetrate the fraud (i.e. Catan), which particulars will be further set out below.
<P1><BOLD>The Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated October 12, 2018 (the &ldquo;Dunphy Decision&rdquo;) at para. 14 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 17)</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW OF THE APPEAL</TI>
<P>3. On this appeal, Leanne Duscio submits that the Trial Judge erred in finding she knowingly assisted a breach of trust, and further, the Trial Judge erred in finding she was willfully blind to the breach of trust committed by Catan at the direction of Anthony.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Fraudulent Scheme Perpetrated by Anthony and Garcia</EM></TI>
<P>4. Justice Dunphy found that:
<P1>a. Anthony and Garcia fraudulently caused $3 million of the Plaintiff's money to be transferred to Catan on August 22, 2008. Garcia knew that Anthony would control the funds once transferred to Catan.
<P2><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 362 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 59-60)</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>b. the funds received by Catan was the consequence of the fraudulent scheme and in breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff, and therefore the funds were impressed with a constructive trust in favour of the Plaintiff. Catan breached its obligations as constructive trustee by failing to hold the funds separate and apart and failing to take immediate steps to return them to the Plaintiff.
<P2><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 470 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 76)</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Background of Catan and Anthony's De Facto Control</EM></TI>
<P>5. Catan was a company that was incorporated more than two years prior to receiving the $3 million (Catan was incorporated on January 1, 2006). Leanne was listed with the Ministry as the sole officer and director of Catan. Leanne testified that she was the sole shareholder as well.
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 332 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. Leanne testified that the company was incorporated in January 2006 for the purpose of being the owner of a commercial building purchased for her dance studio business at 20 Queen Street North in Kitchener (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Queen Street Property&rdquo;</BOLD>).
<P1><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at page 9, lines 15&ndash;23 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 131; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 11)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. The Queen Street Property was purchased by Catan on January 12, 2006, which was 10 days after Catan was incorporated and two years before the $3 million was received.
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 332 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. Justice Dunphy found that, despite the public records indicating that Leanne was the sole director and officer, in fact, &ldquo;Anthony was at all material times the <EM>de facto</EM> controlling mind and will of Catan&rdquo;. Justice Dunphy found that Anthony made &ldquo;virtually all of the financial decisions in relation to Catan, controlled all of its banking, arranged for the keeping of its books and records, etc&rdquo;. Justice Dunphy found that Leanne had &ldquo;little to no direct information about any of the business undertaken by Catan&rdquo; and &ldquo;played nothing but a passive role&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Catan was for all intents and purposes Anthony's alter ego&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 333 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. Justice Dunphy found that Leanne was advised by her husband from time to time what needed signing, and when asked, did so with little apparent curiosity. The Appellant submits that the only evidence before the court in support of this conclusion related to circumstances that pre-date the receipt of $3 million by Catan. Leanne testified that she was not certain about how Catan paid the purchase price of $1 million for the Queen Street Property in 2006, nor was she aware of the particulars of the various mortgages registered on title to the property at the time. Leanne testified that she was not aware of how the mortgages were paid off in 2016 when the Queen Street Property was sold, nor was she aware of how the mortgages were discharged on closing. In response to that testimony, counsel for the Plaintiff questioned Leanne on cross examination about idea what was happening?&rdquo;. Leanne then answered that she would have signed the papers &ldquo;and probably not given it a lot of thought either&rdquo;. That however only related to a proper business transaction for the purchase and subsequent sale of real estate for proper consideration.
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 333 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56); and</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at p. 12&ndash;19 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 132&ndash;139; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 14&ndash;21)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. The evidence relating to Leanne &ldquo;signing papers&rdquo; for Catan had no connection to the $3 million received by Catan on August 22, 2008. There was no evidence that Leanne knew anything at all about the $3 million. The Plaintiff never suggested to Leanne on cross examination that she had knowledge of the $3 million, or any transaction that occurred thereafter with those funds at the time.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The $3 Million Received by Catan</EM></TI>
<P>11. Justice Dunphy found as a fact that Anthony &ldquo;arranged for the receipt of the $3 million by Catan and was responsible for authorizing and actually disbursing virtually all of those funds by Catan&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 470 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 76)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. From the $3 million received by Catan, Justice Dunphy found that Anthony (not Leanne) caused the sum of $2,593,152.56 to be wire transferred by Catan to the following:

<P>13. With respect to these wire transfers set out above, Justice Dunphy found that Leanne had no involvement and to the contrary, made the following explicit findings:
<ITEM><P>Anthony caused the wire transfer to be sent to Mr. Nicolas de Leon Morales at the direction of Mr. Garcia<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 363 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 60)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>;</P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P>the wire transfer from Catan to Columbus Capital was a transfer by Anthony or &ldquo;at his direction&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 404 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 64)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>14. There was no evidence at trial that Leanne had any involvement with wire transfers for Catan. Anthony testified that only himself or his book keeper, Kelly, arranged wire transfers for Catan. In fact, Justice Dunphy found that Anthony &ldquo;controlled all banking&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at p. 133, lines 21&ndash;32 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 148; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 135); and</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 333 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. There was no evidence at trial that Leanne knew anything about these transfers totaling $2,593,152.56 at the time. Leanne had no knowledge that this money was held by Catan in the first place. The Plaintiff never suggested to Leanne on cross examination that she knew anything at the time about these wire transfers whereby Catan received and then disbursed the Plaintiff's money.</P>
<P>16. Justice Dunphy found that Anthony caused the remaining amount of approximately $400,000 held by Catan to be spent on the following personal expenditures:
<ITEM><P>Advances to Leanne's Dance Studio ($19,231);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Tony Duscio lawyers, paid as accounts payable ($76,558);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Tony Duscio lawyers, charged as shareholder advances ($17,000);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Payroll to Leanne starting in January 2009 ($8,250);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Leanne Duscio ($20,000);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Cash withdrawals ($12,500);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>John Duscio ($8,000);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>BMW shareholder advance ($25,890);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Tony Duscio cheque ($5,000);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Home Improvements (at least $32,000 identified).</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 394 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 62-63)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Even in respect of the findings regarding the $400,000 spent by Anthony on personal expenditures, only three directly involved Leanne ($19,231, $8,250, and $20,000). There was no evidence at all suggesting that Leanne, in fact, had any participation in any of these transactions nor was even one question put to Leanne that she knowingly received trust funds from Catan. Further, she was not even asked what the receipt of those money's were for or where she thought the money was coming from.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Limited Documents put to Leanne at Trial</EM></TI>
<P>18. At trial the Plaintiff filed a &ldquo;Compendium for Antonio Duscio and Leanne Duscio&rdquo;. Initially there were only two total documents put to Leanne during her cross examination at Trial:
<P1>a. Tab 1 of the Plaintiff's Compendium, which is a Corporate Profile Report for Catan<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at page 9, lines 3&ndash;9 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 131; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 11); Corporate Profile Report for Catan (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 6; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 191&ndash;196)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>; and</P1>

<P>19. At the conclusion of Leanne's cross examination, the following exchange occurred between counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr. Devellis, and Dunphy J.:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at page 52, line 30 to page 53, line 29 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 141-142; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 54-55)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>MR. DEVELLIS: Well, they're not signatures, <EM>per se</EM>, they're wires....</P>
<P>THE COURT: Just march through it, and prove the documents that she can prove, and let's drive on.</P>
<P>MR. DEVELLIS: Okay.</P>
<P>THE COURT: And if they've been proved that on discovery, you'll read that in later, but let's get me what documents you can prove through this witness or otherwise.</P>
<P>MR. DEVELLIS: Fair enough. If I can&mdash;there are documents that are wire transfers, and I just want to take her to the ledger and say&mdash;ask her about those, and then...</P>
<P>THE COURT: Well...</P>
<P>MR. DEVELLIS: ...we'll be done with her.</P>
<P>THE COURT: ...she's just told you she's&mdash;unless she&mdash;if her signature's on it, then someone told her to do it.

<P>20. Following this, the Plaintiff put only three total additional documents to Leanne (and no read-ins from discovery):

Leanne was not asked if she knew anything about the wire transfer at the time, nor whether she was aware of this transfer at any time prior to the litigation with the Plaintiff. Dunphy J. disallowed the questions being asked by counsel for the Plaintiff about this document on the basis that they were not proper questions and what was being put to Leanne was &ldquo;just argument based on the accounting records&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at page 55 lines 8 to page 56 line 12 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 144-145; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 57-58); Wire Transfer (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 7; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 295)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>; and</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES &amp; ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>The Appellant submits that this court should determine the following issues:
<P1>(i) Did the Trial Judge err when he found Leanne was willfully blind?</P1>
<P1>(ii) Did the Trial Judge err when he found Leanne knowingly assisted a breach of trust?</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>(i)</N><TI>Did the Trial Judge err when he found Leanne was willfully blind?</TI>
<P>21. The Trial Judge premised his conclusion that Leanne was &ldquo;willfully blind&rdquo; to the breach of trust committed by Catan based upon the following findings (emphasis added):
<QUOTE><P>474 In Leanne Duscio's case, I find that her passive acquiescence in her husband's schemes went beyond mere trust and faith and crossed the line into wilful blindness. She knew that her husband had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year and she knew generally what reverses had led him there. <BOLD>She continued to sign as needed cheques and authorizations for very large quantities of money to transit through her company without due inquiry and in circumstances where she ought to have been on inquiry.</BOLD> She cannot hide behind her own wilful blindness to avoid the consequences of facilitating her husband's fraud.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>(Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 76)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The Appellant submits that there was no evidence that Leanne &ldquo;signed cheques and authorizations for very large quantities of money that transited through [Catan]&rdquo;. The Trial Judge patently misapprehended the evidence in that regard, which led His Honour to incorrectly conclude that Leanne was willfully blind to the breach of trust. In fact, the Trial Judge expressly found, to the contrary, that Anthony &ldquo;controlled all banking&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 333 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 56)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and completed all wire transfers on his own without any involvement whatsoever from Leanne<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>See para. 12-13 of the within Factum</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P>
<P>23. There was no evidence that Leanne knew at the time that Catan received nor paid out any large sums of money that would put a reasonable person on inquiry. The evidence at trial only established that Leanne knew that Catan was trying to recover a loan from Columbus Capital ($513,931.92) months after the transfer from Catan to Columbus Capital. The Appellant submits that in order to be responsible for assisting a &ldquo;breach of trust&rdquo; one would need to know about the &ldquo;breach of trust&rdquo; at the time.</P>
<P>24. With respect to Dunphy J.'s finding that Leanne knew &ldquo;her husband had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year, Dunphy J. failed to consider that Leanne also testified that &ldquo;I didn't understand the meaning of it anyways&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Transcript of the Cross Examination of Leanne Duscio on April 12, 2018 at page 47, lines 24&ndash;29 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 5, p. 140; Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, at p. 49)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With respect to Dunphy J.'s finding that &ldquo;she knew generally what reverses had led him there&rdquo;, the appellant submits that there is no evidence to support that finding.</P>
<P>25. For all of the foregoing reasons, it is submitted that the Trial Judge committed a palpable and overriding error that led the Trial Judge incorrectly concluding that Leanne was willfully blind when there was no proper findings by him to premise those conclusions.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(ii)</N><TI>Did the Trial Judge err when he found Leanne knowingly assisted a breach of trust?</TI>
<P>26. In <CASEREF><SOC>Air Canada v. M and L Travel Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the required elements for the tort of &ldquo;knowing assistance&rdquo;:
<P1>a. a stranger to a trust can be found personally liable for breach of trust if they knowingly participated in the breach of trust (para. 35)</P1>
<P1>b. persons who assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustee will be liable for the breach of trust as constructive trustees (para. 38)</P1>
<P1>c. the knowledge requirement for this type of liability is actual knowledge, and recklessness or willful blindness will also suffice. A person willfully shutting his eyes to the obvious is in no different position than if he had kept them open (para. 39).</P1>
<P1>d. constructive knowledge (knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest person, or knowledge of facts which would put an honest person on inquiry) <BOLD>is insufficient</BOLD> to bind the stranger's conscience so as to give rise to personal liability. Cases involving recklessness or willful blindness indicate a &lsquo;want of probity which justifies imposing a constructive trust&rsquo;. The carelessness involved in constructive knowledge cases will not normally amount to a want of probity, and will therefore be insufficient to bind the stranger's conscience. (para. 41)</P1>
<P1>e. taking of a knowingly wrongful risk resulting in prejudice to the beneficiary is sufficient to ground personal liability (para. 60)
<P2><BOLD>[1993] 3 S.C.R. 787 (Book of Authorities of the Appellant at tab 1)</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>27. In <CASEREF><SOC>Bikur Cholim Jewish Volunteer Services v. Penna Estate</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Bikur</EM>&rdquo;), the Ontario Court of Appeal stated the following regarding the difference between &ldquo;constructive knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;willful blindness&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>it seems to me that the concept discussed in <EM>Air Canada</EM> of &ldquo;want of probity&rdquo;, meaning lack of honesty, captures the notion implicit in the concept of a party or privy to a fraud or fraudulent breach of trust. It cannot be enough that the trustee was simply negligent or ought to have known that the co-trustee was committing a fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>2009 ONCA 196 (Book of Authorities of the Appellant at tab 2, para. 43)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. The Appellant states that the Trial Judge committed an error of law when he found Leanne knowingly assisted a breach of trust. The Trial Judge equated constructive knowledge with willful blindness, when in fact, the two concepts involve distinctly different legal thresholds of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. The Honourable Mr. Justice Dunphy found that Leanne &ldquo;ought to have been on inquiry&rdquo;, which the appellant submits amounts to constructive knowledge and not willful blindness. The Court of Appeal's decision in <EM>Bikur</EM> stands for the proposition that in order for Leanne to be liable for knowing assistance of a breach of trust she must have been &ldquo;a party or privy to a fraud&rdquo;, and Dunphy J. found the contrary when he found that only Anthony and Garcia perpetrated the fraudulent investment scheme to misappropriate the Plaintiff's funds.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Dunphy Decision at para. 14 (Appeal Book and Compendium at tab 3, p. 17)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Further, the Appellant submits that the Trial Judge's finding of &ldquo;willful blindness&rdquo; was premised on an incorrect finding regarding Leanne's involvement with signing cheques and authorizations for very large quantities of money transiting through Catan.</P>
<P>30. The Appellant submits that there was absolutely no evidence to support a finding of &ldquo;want of probity&rdquo; or a lack of honesty on the part of Leanne. Leanne's total evidence spanned the total of 60 pages. The only evidence before the court was that these transactions disposing of the &ldquo;trust money&rdquo; were completed by Anthony. In fact, Dunphy J. found that that Anthony &ldquo;controlled all banking&rdquo; and was solely responsible for the largest transfers conducted by Catan that disposed of $2,593,152.56 of the total $3 million. The knowledge requirement was therefore not established, which is a required component of the tort of &ldquo;knowing assistance&rdquo;.</P>
<P>31. Finally, the Trial Judge did not find that Leanne was liable for &ldquo;knowing <BOLD>receipt&rdquo;</BOLD> of trust funds, which requires a lower threshold of knowledge than &ldquo;knowing <BOLD>assistance</BOLD>&rdquo; according to the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Citadel General Assurance Co. v. Lloyds Bank Canada</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Citadel</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). The receipt of trust property was also not a finding relied upon by the Trial Judge in coming to the conclusion that Leanne knowingly assisted in a breach of trust. In knowing receipt cases, a stranger to the trust need not have actual knowledge that they are receiving funds in breach of trust, but only constructive knowledge (i.e. the lower threshold of knowledge). The Supreme Court of Canada has held that more is expected of the recipient, who, unlike the accessory, is necessarily enriched at the plaintiff's expense. The recipient is held to this higher standard, and therefore constructive knowledge is sufficient as the basis for the restitutionary liability. It is this lack of inquiry that renders the recipient's enrichment unjust under the tort of &ldquo;knowing receipt&rdquo;, which does not apply in this case.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Citadel</EM> [1997] 3 S.C.R. 805 (Book of Authorities of the Appellant at tab 3, para. 48-49)</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS</BOLD>, Eduardo Garcia, Patricia Garcia, Managed (Portfolio), Corp., Genesis (LA), Corp. (Ontario Corporation Number 1653094), Genesis (LA), Corp. (Alberta Corporate Access Number 2013145921), FC Int, Corp., and First Canadian Int, Corp. (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Garcia Appellants&rdquo;</BOLD>), will make a Motion to a single Judge of the Court of Appeal on, March 8, 2019, at 10:00 am, or as soon after that time as the motion can be heard, at Osgoode Hall, 130 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario. The motion is properly brought before a single Judge of the Court of Appeal in accordance with section 7(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c C43.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The motion is to be heard
<P1>[ ] in writing under subrule 37.12.1(1);</P1>
<P1>[ ] in writing as an opposed motion under subrule 37.12.1(4);</P1>
<P1>[x] orally.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. An interim Order under section 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> granting the Garcia Appellants access to funds for the purposes of funding past and future legal fees;</P>
<P>2. In the alternative, an Order granting a stay of the May 14, 2018 Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Dunphy, to permit the Garcia Appellants to raise $150,000 for legal fees; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE</BOLD></P>
<P>1. The decision appealed from was released on October 12, 2018 (with corrections on October 24, 2018), by the Honourable Justice Dunphy (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Judgment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. On Motion by the Plaintiff, Justice Dunphy granted a non-dissipation order on May 14, 2018 effectively freezing all of the worldwide assets of the Garcia Appellants (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Non-Dissipation Order</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The Garcia Appellants brought a motion, returnable October 31, 2018, to vary the Non-Dissipation Order, seeking access to funds subject to the Non-Dissipation Order for the purpose of funding their intended appeal of the Judgment (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Varying Motion</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. Justice Dunphy ultimately dismissed the Garcia Appellants' Varying Motion, without prejudice to the appellants seeking similar relief in the context of a stay application before the Court of Appeal.</P>
<P>5. To perfect the appeal, the Garcia Appellants require funds to pay counsel for work undertaken since trial, to fund the costs of appeal and to order transcripts. The total of these costs is approximately $150,000.</P>
<P>6. The trial from which the Garcia Appellants are appealing was for heard over 16-days. Costs for transcripts for the entire trial will be approximately $15,000.</P>
<P>7. As a result of the Non-Dissipation Order the Garcia Appellants do not have access to any funds to order the transcripts required to carry out the appeal, let alone fund their appeal in order to be represented by counsel.</P>
<P>8. Without access to funds, the Garcia Defendants will not be able to exercise their right to appeal</P>
<P>9. The appeal is meritorious.</P>
<P>10. The balance of convenience favours the Garcia Defendants.</P>
<P>11. Rules 63.02(1)(b)of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg 994.</P>
<P>12. Section 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c C43.</P>
<P>13. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court permits.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the motion</P>
<P>1. The Affidavit of Cameron Fiske, sworn January 23, 2019; and</P>
<P>2. Such further and other evidence as counsel may advise, and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS</BOLD> estimate that the time required for the hearing of this motion is 2 hour.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF CAMERON FISKE (January 23, 2019)</TI>
<P>I, Cameron Fiske, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a partner with the law firm of Milosevic Fiske LLP, lawyers for the Applicants/Appellants in this matter, and as such I have personal knowledge of the matters to which I hereinafter depose, except where I have stated that my knowledge is based on information I have received from others, and where so stated I verily believe that information to be true.</P>
<P>2. At the conclusion of a 16-day trial in the within matter before the Honourable Mr. Justice Dunphy, on or about May 14, 2018, the plaintiffs made a motion for an order preventing Eduardo Garcia, aka Eddie Obregon, aka Eduardo Garcia Obregon, Patricia Garcia, aka Claudia Santisteban, aka Claudia Patricia Santisteban, aka Claudia Patricia de Garcia, aka Claudia Patricia Santisteban Juarez, aka Claudia Patricia Santisteban Juarez de Garcia, Managed (Portfolio), Corp., Genesis (La), Corp. (Ontario Corporation Number 1653094), Genesis (La), Corp. (Alberta Corporate Access Number 2013145921), Fc Int, Corp., and First Canadian Int, Corp. (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Garcia Appellants</BOLD>&rdquo;), from dissipating any funds or assets pending the rendering of Judgement in the within action, and for certain other ancillary relief.</P>
<P>3. On or about May 23, 2018, Justice Dunphy granted the plaintiff's motion, ordering the Garcia Appellants' worldwide assets frozen, and preventing the Garcia Appellants from dissipating their assets in any way (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Non-Dissipation Order</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Non-Dissipation Order is in force pending the satisfaction of the judgement. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Justice Dunphy's May 23, 2018 Non-Dissipation Order.</P>
<P>4. On or about October 12, 2018, Justice Dunphy released his Reasons for Judgment in the within matter, Court File No. CV-11-9210-00CL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Judgment</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Judgment found the Garcia Appellants liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $20,843,888. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Justice Dunphy's Judgment.</P>
<P>5. In order to access funds for their appeal of the Judgment, the Garcia Appellants brought a motion, returnable October 31, 2018, seeking to vary the Non-Dissipation Order as provided in section 19 of the Non-Dissipation Order.</P>
<P>6. Justice Dunphy ultimately dismissed the Garcia Appellants' October 31, 2018 motion, without prejudice to the appellants seeking similar relief in the context of a stay application before the Court of Appeal (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Varying Order</BOLD>&rdquo;). Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Justice Dunphy's Reasons for Decision for the Varying Order.</P>
<P>7. An important finding made by the Motion's Judge is contained at paragraph 39 of the Varying Order:
<QUOTE><P>The position of the Garcia Defendants&mdash;at this point at least&mdash;is limited to a request for access to funds for the purposes of the appeal that are not subject to a proprietary claim. I have found that at least $143,000 of the funds used to purchase the family home in Kitchener are not subject to the plaintiff's proprietary claim.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. These are the non-proprietary funds the Garcia Appellants seek to access for the purposes of paying their counsel. These funds have been found to be non-proprietary, and no party has challenged that finding. Without these funds, the Garcia Appellants will be denied an opportunity to appeal.</P>
<P>9. All of the Garcia Appellants' funds have been frozen by the May 23, 2018 Order. Mr. Garcia deposed at paragraph 43 of his October 22, 2018 affidavit that his uncle had at one time offered to lend him funds, but that he did not know whether that offer was still open and assumed it would be opposed by the plaintiff in any event.
<P1><BOLD>Copy of the Affidavit of Eduardo Garcia dated October 22, 2018 (&ldquo;Garcia Affidavit&rdquo;) and exhibits attached thereto attached as Exhibit &ldquo;4&rdquo;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. What the Garcia Appellants proposed in the motion before Justice Dunphy was that they be permitted to liquidate a Guaranteed Investment Certificate held at Bank of Montreal valued at $350,068.56 (the &ldquo;GIC&rdquo;), pay $150,000 of those proceeds to their lawyer, and pay the remaining proceeds to the credit of the action, pending the outcome of the appeal.</P>
<P>11. The $150,000 from the GIC would be secured against the non-proprietary equity they held in their family home (the &ldquo;Falconridge Property&rdquo;).</P>
<P>12. Alternatively, the Garcia Appellants proposed raising financing against the Falconridge Property.
<P1><BOLD>Garcia Affidavit at paragraphs 8&ndash;11 attached as Exhibit &ldquo;4&rdquo;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. The Garcia Appellants have appealed Justice Dunphy's Judgment on the grounds that, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the trial judge erred in assessing damages against the Garcia Appellants, that the trial judge ignored or failed to consider certain of the Garcia Appellants' defences, and that the trial judge misapprehended and/or failed to consider relevant evidence before him. A copy of the Notice of Appeal dated November 12, 2018 is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit 5.</BOLD></P>
<P>14. In their Notice of Appeal, the Garcia Appellants appeal the Judgment on the additional grounds that certain of their defences, including the defence of the doctrine of corporate identification, and a significant limitations defence were not addressed by the trial judge in his Judgment at all.</P>
<P>15. The Garcia Appellants amended their statement of defence to plead a defence of corporate identification. Despite this, the Garcia Appellants, in their Notice of Appeal, allege that trial judge failed to address the doctrine, or its applicability to the facts at hand, in his Judgment.</P>
<P>16. The cumulative effect of the trial judge's errors, including his failure to address certain defences, as set out in the Garcia Appellants' Notice of Appeal, forms the basis of the Appellants arguments in the within appeal.</P>
<P>17. I have spoken to my law partner, David Milosevic (&ldquo;Milosevic&rdquo;), and he tells me, and I verily believe, that he is not prepared to proceed with an appeal of Justice Dunphy's decision if legal fees incurred since trial, as well as fees for the appeal and the cost of transcripts are not obtained.</P>
<P>18. Milosevic has estimated these total fees at approximately $150,000. This amount includes fees incurred since the end of trial to prepare voluminous disclosures of assets as Ordered by Justice Dunphy, as well as an estimate of some $60,000 for legal fees for perfecting the appeal, which involves review of 16 days of trial testimony, as well as addressing fairly complex legal arguments involving failure by the trial judge to consider limitations defences, corporate identification defences, factual errors relating to the account documents allegedly relied upon by the plaintiff, as well as the trial decision being based upon theories of liability not actually pleaded against the Garcia Appellants.</P>
<P>19. The trial record is voluminous, with over 16 days of trial time and tens of thousands of pages of documents.</P>
<P>20. The Garcia Appellants seek access to $150,000 of equity in their home, which is tied to nonproprietary funds belonging to them. This involves a potential &ldquo;loss&rdquo; to the plaintiff of $150,000 of funds they may be entitled to if the appeal is unsuccessful.</P>
<P>21. For the Garcia Appellants, it is alleged that the denial of their right to their nonproprietary funds is in effect a denial of their right to appeal.</P>
<P>22. In relation to the two assets at issue on this motion, the Falconridge Property and the BMO GIC, the Garcia Appellants propose to pay the balance of proceeds of disposition of those two assets into trust, pending outcome of the appeal. From these two assets, the Garcia Appellants seek $150,00; while they propose to pay into trust or into court some $700,000. On the amounts at issue alone, the Garcia Appellants allege that the balancing of convenience favours them.
<P1><BOLD>Garcia Affidavit at paragraphs 9&ndash;12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. I make this affidavit in support of the Garcia Appellants' motion for an interim order to obtain funds for an appeal or for a stay of the Non-Dissipation Order for the same purpose, and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF EDUARDO GARCIA</TI>
<P>I, EDUARDO GARCIA, of the City of Kitchener, in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, <BOLD>MAKE OATH AND SAY:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. I am a Defendant in this action and as such have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to. Where I do not have such personal knowledge, I indicate the source of my knowledge and believe the information set forth herein to be true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.</P>
<P>2. On May 23, 2018 the Honourable Mr. Justice Dunphy granted me and my wife, Patricia Garcia (&ldquo;Patricia&rdquo;), access to $5,000 per month for living expenses and a one-time amount of $45,000 for legal fees as well as a further one time amount of $5000 for repair costs to prepare our home for sale. A copy of Justice Dunphy's May 23, 2018 order (the Non-Dissipation Order&rdquo;) is attached to the Motion Record of the Garcia Appellants at Tab 1.</P>
<P>3. Patricia and I used funds in our CIBC checking account (&ldquo;the CIBC Account&rdquo;) to fund that $5,000 per month. The majority of this money, $ 18,608.14, came from the credit to the CIBC Account that that bank made on June 14, 2018, which was a reserve for the payment of property taxes that they had been holding, and that they returned on June 14, 2018. All funds ran out on September 24, 2018, and we used the overdraft in the account until October 31, 2018.</P>
<P>4. I had expected that CIBC would have simply set a maximum limit of withdrawals or charges from the CIBC Account of $ 5,000 per month. This way, all uses of funds would have been recorded in the account statements, as they were prior to May 23, 2018. However, CIBC blocked the use of the debit cards and eliminated the pre-authorized payments feature; consequently, it caused us to have to deal mainly in cash. We would withdraw the cash and then make the relevant payments. Also, when we had cheques, we had to cash them instead of deposit them into the account. In fact, during a significant period of time, there was no procedure at the branch regarding what we were and were not allowed to do with the CIBC Account and how. Copy of the CIBC Account statements dated May 1 to December 31 2018 and corresponding spreadsheet of use of funds with available receipts attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>5. On June 18, 2018 Patricia began work at Nature's Pharm on Lexington Road in Waterloo. Her salary totals approximately $2102 per month. We have been cashing her checks through the CIBC Account</P>
<P>6. In addition, Patricia has a small online business selling headbands for children. That business has earned some $1,151.11, pre-tax, from June to December 2018. Those funds were paid by Etsy into our CIBC Account: $ 488.59 on November 5, $638.68 on November 29, and $23.84 on December 4, 2018. Patricia also received pre-tax $262.35 in cash from a store in Waterloo, invoices # W18004 and W18005.</P>
<P>7. Between June and December 2018, we received approximately $1208 worth of Child Tax benefits, those cheques were cashed by Patricia. A copy of Patricia's total income's information: salary (including T4), online business and Child Tax benefits, and corresponding spreadsheet of use of funds attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>8. In December 2018, we received back from a criminal lawyer in Toronto, Boris Bytensky, $1370 we had remaining in trust with him. He had been recommended to us by our former lawyer, Sharon Ilavsky, to deal with potential extradition issues. We kept this cheque as a small emergency reserve for a few weeks and cashed it through our CIBC Account on February 11, 2019. A copy of the trust check # 003925 from Boris Bytensky and bank transaction record is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>9. On December 28 2018, Patricia opened a new checking account at CIBC, that she has barely used to date, which has a balance of $ 694.53 to December 31 2018. A copy of the account opening forms and account statement is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>10. I believe Patricia also received a refund check from CRA of approximately $1400 that she cashed at the bank.</P>
<P>11. This is how we have been making ends meet. We have no other source of funds that is not frozen by Justice Dunphy's Non-Dissipation Order.</P>
<P>12. Our monthly income and expenses as of March 1, 2019 are as follows:

</P>
<P>13. The reason why I include only one vehicle, mine, is because the other one is leased with Subaru Financial Services (Acct # 540[#omitted]) by Patricia and is not an asset of ours. A Copy of the Lease Termination Notice dated February 6, 2019 and Statement of Account from Subaru Financial Services dated February 5, 2019 is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>14. We generally do not have enough money to make ends meet each month. I have been going to the food bank at the Salvation Army, 300 Gage Avenue in Kitchener and the House of Friendship, on Guelph St. in Kitchener to get food for my entire family; they have records of my attendance there. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email to House of Friendship advising them of our change of address.</P>
<P>15. I have tried to find employment, but have been unsuccessful. I have been trying to find a job or pursue business opportunities, but I have had no success. My name is all over the internet, both in English and Spanish, and this has not helped my chances.</P>
<P>16. I have applied for a number of jobs and I have approached individuals looking for business collaboration, all without success. Some of these people did not even answer me. I have attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> certain exhibits regarding my job searches and my current business venture.</P>
<P>17. A few months ago, I applied to drive for Uber and was accepted. I then had my vehicle certified for that purpose. In order to start driving I needed a phone that would support the Uber application and also an unfrozen bank account. I did not receive the confirmation to go ahead and open the account until December 2018.</P>
<P>18. Given my experience, I would rather try to find a job or start my own business with some relation to my professional background, before devoting my time to being employed in delivery or Uber work. I believe I would be able to earn more using my actual experience and qualifications.</P>
<P>19. In recent months, I have been working to start a consulting firm, Eduardo Garcia &amp; Associates. This time, I will not be alone; I will have three associates, each of them with experience in their specific fields. This time, I. hope that my business will get under way and eventually thrive. I expect the website to be ready to launch in the second half of March 2019.</P>
<P>20. This project has taken me many weeks of intensely dedicating my time and focus to it, including many conversations with my potential associates with respect to the various aspects of the services or products to be offered, mainly to Latin America. My three associates will be:</P>
<P>21. Asha Solutions: Asha Solutions is a leading expert developer of state-of-the-art custom-engineered platforms and consultancy in cybersecurity and cyber intelligence to government agencies, central banks and private financial institutions in Latin America. They also work alongside large companies in the telecommunications, public utilities and energy industries.</P>
<P>22. GJH Consulting: GJH Consulting is an investigative, consulting and advisory firm. The firm's principal, Gil Hughes (Ret. Det), was a 28 1/2 year policing veteran before becoming a private investigator. He is a recipient of a commendation from the Durham Crown Attorney's office for Investigative Excellence, and from ASIS International (formerly the American Society for Industrial Security) for Robbery Investigations. He also received the House of Commons Award for Bravery. He has taught Ethics, Criminology and Interviewing at Durham College of Applied Arts and Technology;</P>
<P>23. Elite International Consultants: Elite International Consultants is a brokerage firm with more than 30 years providing US life insurance coverage to South American residents, for the most part, Venezuela. It also provides specialty risk insurance under Lloyds' umbrella, including Kidnap and Extortion coverage.</P>
<P>24. I would also add, during the months of August to November, I, with some friends, explored and worked on three business possibilities: a) importing avocados and other produce from Monterrey, Mexico for sale in Ontario (friends Efren Valadez, Victor Carrion); b) a small construction project (friends Roberto Lopez, Efren Valadez); c) investments in delinquent real estate being auctioned through judicial proceedings in Monterrey, Mexico (friend Efren Valadez). Unfortunately, none of these ideas prospered, mainly due to the lack of capital and time of the potential key partner.</P>
<P>25. I am being forthright in disclosing all of my potential business interest and the people I am planning to work with. I would ask respectfully that no one contact these parties in relation to these proceedings without a court order or summons. My attempts to generate income are difficult enough as it is. I am happy to provide any information from these persons that may be required by the court, but I ask that this be done through my counsel so as not to destroy the work I have been engaged in for months now.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Sale of our family home</TI>
<P>26. On November 1, 2018 Justice Dunphy ordered that we could sell our family home located at [location omitted] (&ldquo;Falconridge&rdquo;). A copy of the November 1, 2018 Order of Justice Dunphy is attached to the Appellants' Motion Record at Tab 3.</P>
<P>27. Justice Dunphy had indicated in court that he would have his decision ready by the end of June, 2018. We moved out of the house in August 2018 to have it ready for sale, but Justice Dunphy did not release his trial decision until October 12, 2018, and the motion to sell the house was not heard until October 31, 2018.</P>
<P>28. At the time we moved, we believed that the sale of the house was imminent, and we did not want to wait for a potential eviction or other proceeding before we found a place to live with our daughter, who needed to be ready for the new school year come September without the disturbance of a move.</P>
<P>29. We advised our lawyer of our intention to move in May 30, 2018, shortly after the trial. We found a semidetached house at a very good rent and we signed a tenancy agreement and moved on August 24, 2018. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the email to my lawyer dated May 30, 2018 and a copy of my tenancy agreement. I note that by including the email with my lawyer I do not intend to waive privilege over the contents and provide it for the purpose of showing that the sale of Falconridge was contemplated almost immediately following trial.</P>
<P>30. From the day trial ended, we have intended to sell Falconridge. This is why we requested $5000 for repairs from Justice Dunphy be included in the Non-Dissipation Order, which it was. But since the sale was delayed waiting for the Judgement, that $5000 has not been used as yet.</P>
<P>31. A real estate agent has been retained and the house is ready for sale. We hope it will sell in the spring market. Copy of the Opinion of Value and Comparative Market Analysis as well as signed listing agreement with the Bosley Real Estate Ltd. agent attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>No other sources of funds</TI>
<P>32. Patricia and I do not have access to any other funds or assets to fund our litigation or living expenses. Patricia's mother, Francisca Juarez, tells me, and I believe, that she has a bank account in Guatemala with approximately $ 6000 US dollars in it. Attached, as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the account statements from September 2015 to April 2017, which, Patricia's mother tells me, and I believe, shows the current balance as of today. She sent me some $950 a couple of weeks ago to help support my family with our living expenses.</P>
<P>33. Patricia's mother also has a home in Guatemala valued at approximately $90,000. A copy of the closing documents for purchase of that home dated September 2, 2008 is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Nicolas De Leon Morales</TI>
<P>34. Nicolas De Leon Morales (&ldquo;De Leon&rdquo;) received a total of approximately $1,620,193 from me, my corporations or from other parties over the years. That figure includes $1,335,193 related to the action, and $285,000 unrelated to the action.</P>
<P>35. De Leon, some time later, sent to Canada a total of approximately $1,395,864.64. Currently there is approximately $364,000 in a checking account at the Bank of Montreal, and I believe that this money might be a portion of the total of funds that De Leon sent. However, one of the reasons why I, at this time, am not able to determine how much of that $364,000 corresponds to funds at issue in this action and how much corresponds to transactions outside this action, is that I do not have copies of De Leon's bank records.</P>
<P>36. The $1,335,193 that De Leon received, related to the action, is comprised of the following:
<P1>i. $30,462 in April 2009, from the account of my corporation FC Int Corp.;</P1>
<P1>ii. $1,085 million between August 2008 and January 2009, paid by Columbus Capital for the impugned investment in promissory notes made with that company;</P1>
<P1>iii. $61,772 in February 2008, from the account of my corporation Managed (Portfolio) Corp. (&ldquo;MPC&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>iv. $71,095 in December 2007, from the account of my corporation Genesis (LA), Corp. This money was sent to him so that he could assist me in the purchase of the house for my mother-in-law, mentioned above. This money did not return to Canada;</P1>
<P1>v. $67,410 in October 2007, from the account of my corporation FC Int Corp.;</P1>
<P1>vi. $19,454 in October 2007, from the account of my corporation MPC;</P1>
<P1>Additionally, he received the following two amounts, not related to the trial:</P1>
<P1>i. $175,000 in March 2008 (related to an investment with First Canadian Private Wealth Group;</P1>
<P1>ii. $110,000 in November 2008 (related to a transaction with Keystone Settlements International).</P1></P>
<P>37. The above information was disclosed in bank records provided as part of the discovery process in this action.</P>
<P>38. In the two years following De Leon's receipt of the above funds, he returned $1,395,864.64 to Canada in a series of transactions with me and my corporations as follows:
<P1>i. $541,868.22 received by FC Int Corp. as a loan, for which it issued a promissory note at 4.25% annual interest, in favour of De Leon, dated October 16, 2008. These funds were invested, in their entirety, with TD Waterhouse's Mr. Todd Cook, and all the monthly statements of that investment have been disclosed by me to the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>On November 1, 2010 FC Int Corp. paid interest to De Leon via wire transfer for $16,278.40;</P1>
<P1>ii. $425,491.42 received by MPC as a loan, for which it issued a promissory note at 6% annual interest in favour of De Leon, dated February 24, 2009 (the total debt in this promissory note was eventually transferred to FC Int Corp., February 24, 2009).</P1>
<P1>These funds were invested, in their entirety, with TD Waterhouse's Mr. Todd Cook, and all the monthly statements of that investment have been disclosed by me to the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>On February 24, 2009, MPC paid interest to De Leon via wire transfer for $51,058.97;</P1>
<P1>iii. $428,505 received by MPC in January 2011 according to the Commission/Fee Payment Agreement regarding Columbus Capital investment, between De Leon and me, dated August 15, 2008.</P1></P>
<P>39. I note that the amount of funds Mr. De Leon sent to Canada exceeds the amount he had received some time prior that are related to the action.</P>
<P>40. Again, I believe that the plaintiff has copies of the bank documents of the interest payments and the payment derived from the funds received by MPC pursuant to the Commission/Fee Payment Agreement since all this was done during the material time from which the plaintiff obtained bank records.</P>
<P>41. Mr. Leon's investment in Genesis (LA), Corp. shares is what eventually was moved over to Bank of Montreal under an Ontario corporation where he is a director, and to the above-referred checking account, where he has signing authority.</P>
<P>42. I believe that the plaintiff has copies of my corporations' financial statements which reflect the accounts or positions of assets, liabilities and expenses in respect of all the above; and in addition, copies of the tax returns (corporate and personal) corresponding to the same. Supporting documents relating to these amounts are attached to this affidavit as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>43. If a portion of the funds sent was kept by De Leon, I am not able to determine if that money is related or not to the action, and I have no access to these funds. They have been frozen pursuant to Justice Dunphy's Order and are not available to me.</P>
<P>44. The plaintiff obtained letters of request directed to the judicial authorities in Guatemala, where De Leon resides, permitting it to obtain all information concerning De Leon's bank accounts and to examine De Leon concerning these records. The letters of request can be found at the Appellants' Motion record Tab 1 p.27</P>
<P>45. I do not know whether the plaintiff has obtained these records and examined De Leon, but they have an order permitting them to do so and can thereby determine exactly where all of his funds are. I can state unequivocally that I do not have them nor do I have access to them, even if they had not been frozen by the May 23, 2018 Non-Dissipation Order.</P>
<P>46. All funds I received that were derived from Cajubi or from the other defendants in this action have been disclosed and all of those funds are reflected, down to the penny, in the bank records disclosed in the action. All of these amounts are traceable, and they are frozen. There is no other source of funds beyond the funds I am documented as having received more than 10 years ago in this matter.</P>
<P>47. Since my current lawyers have been on the record, this matter has proceeded efficiently and without any delays. My lawyers agreed to a speedy trial schedule, and have been highly cooperative in ensuring the matter proceeded without unnecessary cost or delay.</P>
<P>48. My lawyers have expended tens of thousands of dollars in billable time since the end of trial to ensure disclosure of information pursuant to the Non-Dissipation Order and to arrange sale of Falconridge, among numerous other issues. They have not been compensated for the bulk of their fees in this regard, but have ensured that this process post-trial goes as smoothly as possible. A copy of the redacted invoice of my lawyers to date is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>49. My lawyers tell me, and I believe, that they are prepared to complete the appeal to the Court of Appeal without request for further fees. The request to obtain funds is therefore not an open-ended request, but is a limited request that will allow me to pursue my appeal rights. My lawyers tell me, and I believe, that without the requested funds, they will no longer be able to act for me.</P>
<P>50. I swear this affidavit in support of my motion for release of funds for legal fees for appeal and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF SAM ZUCCHI</TI>
<P>I, Samuel Zucchi, of the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, <BOLD>MAKE OATH AND SAY</BOLD>:</P>
<P>1. I am an articling student with the law firm Shibley Righton LLP (&ldquo;Shibley&rdquo;), lawyers for the Respondent Caja Paraguay de Jubilaciones y Pensiones del Personal de Itaipu Binacional (&ldquo;Cajubi&rdquo;) and, as such, have knowledge of the matters contained in this Affidavit.</P>
<P>2. Eduardo Garcia Obregon, a.k.a. Eddie Obregon, aka Eduardo Garcia, and Patricia Garcia, aka Claudia Santisteban, aka Caludia Patricia Santisteban, aka Claudia Patricia de Garcia and their companies&mdash;Genesis (LA), Corp., First Canadian Int, Corp., and managed (Portfolio), Corp.&mdash;(collectively, the &ldquo;Garcias&rdquo;) are Applicants/Appellants in this action.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>History of these Proceedings</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>History of the Action</EM></TI>
<P>3. On May 14, 2018, Justice Dunphy made a finding from the bench that the Garcias were liable to Cajubi for civil fraud in the amount of not less than $10 million with reasons and his final determination of damages to follow. This amount was also impressed with a constructive trust in favour of Cajubi. Justice Dunphy also issued from the bench a verbal order freezing the Garcias' assets.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo; is a copy of the transcript for the May 14, 2018 hearing.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>4. On May 23, 2018, Justice Dunphy made a written freezing, non-dissipation and disclosure Order against the Garcias (the &ldquo;Non-Dissipation Order&rdquo;). The Non-Dissipation Order also required that all defendants produce affidavits of assets by June 6, 2018.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo; is a copy of the Non-Dissipation Order.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. Justice Dunphy's Trial Reasons were released on October 12, 2018. In those Reasons, the Garcias were found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, knowing assistance and knowing receipt in the amount of $20,843,888. The Plaintiff was also awarded punitive damages against Mr. Garcia in the amount of $250,000 and Mrs. Garcia in the amount of $100,000, and their full indemnity costs. A constructive trust in favour of Cajubi was impressed on the $20,843,888 that was found to have been fraudulently obtained.</P>
<P>6. The Garcias brought a motion to vary the Non-Dissipation Order to allow them to access $150,000 to fund their appeal against Cajubi. Justice Dunphy heard the motion and dismissed the motion without prejudice to the Garcias' ability to bring it again before the Court of Appeal. He released his substantive reasons on November 1, 2018 (&ldquo;Motion Reasons&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo; is a copy of the November 1, 2018 reasons.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. The trial of this action proceeded as a hybrid, with parties preparing Trial Affidavits. The Trial Affidavits referenced to in my affidavit, along with all their attached exhibits, were entered as numbered Trial Exhibits.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Background</EM></TI>
<P>8. Cajubi is a Pension Fund based in Paraguay. The Garcias created contracts to invest Cajubi's funds, referring in those contracts to themselves as Cajubi's &ldquo;<EM>investment advisor</EM>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<EM>investment agents</EM>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>agent</EM>.&rdquo; The Garcias were not registered to provide investment advice and had no advanced degrees beyond high school.</P>
<P>9. Between 2007 and 2010 Cajubi's president, vice-president and treasurer (the &ldquo;Insiders&rdquo;) had a secret arrangement with the Garcias and would provide information on how to present investment proposals for acceptance by Cajubi's Board of Directors in exchange for secret kickbacks (called &ldquo;<EM>the other end</EM>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<EM>la otra punta</EM>&rdquo;) from those investments. For example:
<P1>(a) On August 9, 2007, Mr. Garcia wrote to one of the Insiders, Mariano Escurra: &ldquo;<EM>What do you think if I suggest the following set of numbers: Lower the expected return for the fund to 15%</EM>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>by increasing the other end by a little bit up front</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(b) On October 8, 2007, Mr. Escurra wrote to Mr. Garcia that <EM>&ldquo;It'll be convenient that communication always be made through me, to always keep the circuit closed</EM>.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(c) On December 5, 2007, Mr. Escurra wrote to Mr. Garcia: &ldquo;<EM>What product would you recommend on 2M USD, that will pass all opposition that might show up and will be &lsquo;Good for All and that we could wrap it all up (including the other end) within this year?</EM>&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;4&rdquo; is a copy of the emails (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>10. The Garcias confirmed that they only exchanged information with the Insiders. Subsequently, these Insiders were arrested, tried and imprisoned in Paraguay for their involvement in the Garcias' investments.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;5&rdquo; is an excerpt from the examination of Mr. Garcia dated January 26, 2018.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. In 2007, Cajubi entered into investment agreements with what it understood were regulated Canadian companies (&ldquo;regulated companies&rdquo;): Genesis Land Development Corp (&ldquo;GLD&rdquo;), First Canadian Capital Corp. (&ldquo;FCCC&rdquo;), and Union Securities Limited (&ldquo;Union&rdquo;), which used a Managed Portfolio product.</P>
<P>12. The Garcias created companies with similar names to the regulated companies as follows: Genesis (LA) Corp., First Canadian Int, Corp. and Managed (Portfolio) Corp. The following are the contracts that Cajubi thought were with the regulated companies. However, these agreements were actually with the Garcias' similarly named companies:
<P1>(a) On April 13, 2007, October 11, 2007 and November 9, 2007 Cajubi entered into agreements with &ldquo;<EM>Genesis, a division of Genesis (LA) Corp.</EM>&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(b) On June 12, 2007, Cajubi entered into an Investment Management Agreement with &ldquo;<EM>First Canadian Int, Corp.</EM>&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(c) On September 25, 2007, Cajubi signed a Managed Portfolio Account Agreement with Union along with multiple Investment Administration Contracts with &ldquo;<EM>Managed (Portfolio), Corp.</EM>&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;6&rdquo; are copies of the agreements with the Garcia corporations (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>13. Throughout the relevant period, the Garcias concealed their identities by using a variety of names. Mrs. Garcia used the name Claudia Santisteban and Patricia Garcia&mdash;once, she did so on the same document.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;7&rdquo; is a copy of a list of names used by Patricia Garcia, letters signed as Claudia Santisteban, and an excerpt from the March 4, 2015 examination of Mrs. Garcia (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Mr. Garcia also misrepresented his professional and educational credentials. On his personal website, he claimed that he was &ldquo;<EM>an accountant who has completed executive programs on financial management at Harvard Business School, London Business School, the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, the University of California Berkely's Haas School of Business and the University of Northwestern's Kellog School of Management</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;8&rdquo; is an excerpt from www.eduardogarciaobregon.com (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Investments in Genesis vs. Garcias' Representation of the Investments</EM></TI>
<P>15. Following Cajubi's decision to invest in GLD, the Garcias sent Cajubi wire instructions which called for Cajubi to wire a portion of the investment to the Garcias' company Genesis (LA) Corp., referenced as &ldquo;<EM>Genesis in Trust</EM>&rdquo; and then a portion toward the actual investment.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;9&rdquo; is a sample of the wire instructions for Genesis (LA) (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. In order to prevent Cajubi's Board from questioning the request for two separate transfers, Escurra told Garcia to give a specific explanation: &ldquo;<EM>You must specify that it is a normal procedure, to regulate the issue of money laundering ... I think this is the last thing needed to close, and it is our only way to protect ourselves on paper regarding the circuit of money in two directions for one single purpose</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo; is a copy of the April 13, 2007 email (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The Garcias created and provided Cajubi with monthly statements of their investments. These statements showed inflated opening balances, fake accrued interest and fake returns. For example, as of January 31, 2009, the statements show an accrued interest totalling $1,276,113.88. Yet the reality was that the Garcias kept the monies wired to them &ldquo;<EM>In Trust</EM>&rdquo; and the Genesis investment has not yet paid anything to investors and has lost well over 90% of its value.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;11&rdquo; is the Genesis Statements from April 2007 to July 2010 (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. In paragraph 143 of his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy referred to the Statements/Projections of Allocated Funds produced by the Garcias as &ldquo;<EM>using purely fictitious numbers without regard to reasonable belief in expectations of actual value</EM>.&rdquo; He further noted that the actual financial statements from Genesis revealed &ldquo;<EM>write-downs of $5.1 million in 2008 and $8.7 million in 2009, none of which were reported to Cajubi or reflected on the monthly statements</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Investments in First Canadian vs. Garcias' Representation of the Investments</EM></TI>
<P>19. Included in a &ldquo;welcome package&rdquo; sent to Cajubi was an &ldquo;<EM>NSAD Note Due June 11, 2012</EM>&rdquo; in the name of FC Int. This note had a &ldquo;<EM>Fixed Target Return</EM>&rdquo; of 14.5%.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;12&rdquo; is a copy of the June 12, 2007 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. In his Trial Affidavit sworn March 29, 2018, Nikolaos Tsimidis (an officer of the regulated company First Canadian) stated &ldquo;<EM>we would not guarantee any percentage returns</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;13&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Trial Affidavit of Nikolaos Tsimidis (Trial Exhibit 7). Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;13A&rdquo; is a copy of an &lsquo;Alert&rsquo; with attachments.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. When Cajubi accepted these investment terms, wire instructions were sent by the Garcias which called for $3.6 million to be wired to Fogler, Rubinoff (counsel for the regulated company at the time) in trust while $400,000 was to be wired to &ldquo;<EM>First Canadian in Trust</EM>&rdquo; (i.e., to the Garcias' company).
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;14&rdquo; is a copy of a June 8 letter from Cajubi confirming these instructions (Trial Exhibit 7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Mr Garcia insisted on controlling any and all information or communications between Cajubi and the regulated company. For example, on November 7, 2008, Mr. Garcia sent an email to Mr. Tsimidis stating &ldquo;<EM>you might be getting a fax from CAJUBI requesting a status on their investments (as of Sep-08), as soon as you receive kindly forward it to me so I can take care of it accordingly</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;15&rdquo; is a copy of the November 7, 2008 email (Trial Exhibit 7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. The Garcias also sent Cajubi fake statements of the value of the First Canadian investments. Those statements showed consistent growth between June 2007 and February 2009. For example, as early as December 31, 2007, the account showed accrued interest of $399,246.56. In reality, almost all the investment was siphoned off by the Garcias or lost due to the undisclosed risky nature of the investment.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;16&rdquo; is a copy of the statements from June 2007 to February 2009 (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. In his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy stated (at paragraph 191) that these statements &ldquo;<EM>were inaccurate. The gains reported each month bore no relationship to actual changes in values of the securities being purchased</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Investments in the Managed Portfolio Account at Union vs. Garcias' Representation of the Investments</EM></TI>
<P>25. In a letter dated September 25, 2007, the Garcias (using Ligia Ponciano's name) outlined a proposed investment which included an &ldquo;<EM>expected net return: above TSX's average, both in &lsquo;bull&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;bear&rsquo; markets</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;17&rdquo; is a copy of the September 25, 2007 letter (Trial Exhibit 5).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. Marty Hibbs was one of the Union employees dealing with Cajubi's investments. At paragraph 58 of his Trial Affidavit sworn March 12, 2018, he stated that the September 25, 2007 letter &ldquo;<EM>makes various statements about the nature of Cajubi's prospective investments with Union that are incorrect</EM>.&rdquo; With regard to the claim that a Union investment will provide a higher return than the TSX, Mr. Hibbs stated &ldquo;<EM>That statement is completely inappropriate for an investment advisor to make: we would never represent to an investor that our returns were greater or lesser than the market</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;18&rdquo; is the Trial Affidavit of Marty Hibbs (Trial Exhibit 5).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. The wire instructions given by the Garcias to Cajubi provided for payments to be split between a transfer to Union for the Managed Portfolio investment and a transfer to the Garcias' company, Managed Portfolio. For example, one set of wire instructions provided that $1,710,685.00 was to be sent to Union, while $388,315.00 was to be sent to &ldquo;<EM>Managed Portfolio in Trust</EM>.&rdquo; At the bottom of these wire instructions, Heather Roberts was listed as the point of contact for &ldquo;<EM>Union Securities-Latin-America Division</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;19&rdquo; is a copy of the wire instructions provided to Cajubi (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. Brian Wadsworth was the Branch Manager for Union. In his Trial Affidavit sworn March 23, 2018, Mr. Wadsworth states that &ldquo;<EM>Though they appear on Union's letterhead, these wire instructions were not prepared by Union</EM>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<EM>Heather Roberts was the Branch Administrator for the Kitchener branch of Union. There was no such thing as &lsquo;Latin American Division&rsquo; as stated in the document</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;20&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Trial Affidavit of Brian Wadsworth (Trial Exhibit 3). Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;20A&rdquo; is a copy of a one page &lsquo;Alert.&rsquo;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. During this period, Mr. Garcia was sending Cajubi correspondence under Heather Roberts' name. In her Trial Affidavit sworn March 23, 2018, Ms. Roberts stated that she only learned of the email address [text omitted] during these legal proceedings. She further stated &ldquo;<EM>I had absolutely no prior knowledge of that email address, nor would I have approved having email intended for me directed to an address out of my control</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;21&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Trial Affidavit of Heather Roberts (Trial Exhibit 4).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. Mr. Garcia always controlled all communications between Cajubi and Union. For example, Mr. Garcia emailed Ms. Roberts on November 12, 2008 to request that she forward any fax received from Cajubi to him &ldquo;<EM>so we can translate and prepare accordingly</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;22&rdquo; is a copy of the November 12, 2008 email (Trial Exhibit 18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. Financial statements (which the Garcias called &ldquo;<EM>Illustrations</EM>&rdquo;) issued by Managed Portfolio showed consistent growth between October 2007 and December 2009.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;23&rdquo; is a copy of the Managed Portfolio Illustrations from October 2007 to December 2009 (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. In his Trial Affidavit, Mr. Hibbs said that these illustrations were not &ldquo;<EM>something that I or anyone at Union would produce... I would never provide a target annual return in an account statement</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;24&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Trial Affidavit of Marty Hibbs (Trial Exhibit 5).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. In paragraph 299 of his Reasons, Justice Dunphy stated &ldquo;<EM>the monthly statements describing the Union investment were intended to deceive Cajubi and bore little relationship to reality</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Ron Timcke&mdash;Rio Conde/Lemontree</EM></TI>
<P>34. The Garcias did not mention Ron Timcke, Rio Conde or Lemontree anywhere in their statement of defence. However, in a letter dated September 21, 2007, subsequently produced by Mr. Garcia (signed only by the &ldquo;<EM>President of Managed (Portfolio)</EM>,&rdquo; who was not named), were statements that funds, including up-front fees of 12.5% would be paid for sales generated by Rio Conde or its sub-contractors.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;25&rdquo; is a copy of the September 21, 2007 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. In an email from Ronald Timcke to Mr. Garcia dated April 30, 2007, Mr. Timcke explained to Mr. Garcia that Lemontree is &ldquo;<EM>a fictitious name for an account opened at the Clariden Leu Bank in Zurich, Switzerland. The owner of this account is Rio Conde SA of Panama city, Panama</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo; is a copy of the April 30, 2007 email (Trial Exhibit 46).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. In an email dated May 3, 2007 to Mr. Garcia, Mr. Timcke asks whether &ldquo;<EM>the name Rio Conde SA will show on an extract or other document received by the investor? if</EM> [sic] <EM>the answer is affirmative, is there a possibility that the intermediary Rio Conde would not show in any way?</EM>&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;27&rdquo; is a copy of the May 3, 2007 email (Trial Exhibit 38).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. In his Trial Affidavit, Mr. Caceres stated that it was only during these legal proceedings that Cajubi learned the Garcias had an agreement with Rio Conde to pay a portion of funds received from Cajubi. He further stated that &ldquo;<EM>Cajubi is not a party to this agreement and it was never considered or discussed at any meeting of Cajubi's Board. This payment was not known to or consented to by Cajubi</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Affidavit of Gustavo Caceres sworn March 29, 2018 (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. Managed Portfolio did not have any products to distribute. In his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy found (at paragraph 235) that &ldquo;<EM>Managed Portfolio was a shell company without employees or any history of operations</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Columbus Notes</EM></TI>
<P>39. Through mid- to late-2009, four &ldquo;<EM>demand promissory</EM>&rdquo; notes were issued by Columbus Capital Corp. (&ldquo;Columbus&rdquo;) to Managed Portfolio in trust for Cajubi (collectively, the &ldquo;Columbus Notes&rdquo;). Specifically:
<P1>(a) On August 21, 2008, for $3 million;</P1>
<P1>(b) On October 30, 2008, for $400,000;</P1>
<P1>(c) On November 28, 2008, for $1,130,430; and</P1>
<P1>(d) On November 28, 2008, for $2,849,528.</P1>
<P1>The total claimed investment was $7,379,958.
<P2><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;29&rdquo; are copies of the four promissory notes (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>40. Columbus was only incorporated on August 25, 2008&mdash;four days after the first Columbus Notes purchase on August 21, 2008.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;30&rdquo; is a copy of a corporate search (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The Columbus investment was portrayed by the Garcias as an investment recommended by Union with a 6% rate of return.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;31&rdquo; is a copy of the October 29, 2008 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. On November 21, 2008, the Board of Cajubi wrote a letter to Marty Hibbs and Scott Colwell. This letter was received by Mr. Garcia, who then showed it to Mr. Hibbs and Mr. Colwell. The letter requested &ldquo;<EM>a transfer of the entire balance in the managed futures account to our position in Columbus Notes with a minimum annualized return of 6%</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;32&rdquo; is a copy of a letter from Cajubi to Marty Hibbs and Scott Colwell dated November 21, 2008. (Trial Exhibit 3).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. After being provided this letter, Mr. Colwell wrote to Mr. Garcia saying, &ldquo;<EM>When you showed it to me yesterday, you mentioned that it was instructions from Cajubi directly to you... When we read the letter this morning, we noticed it was addressed directly to Marty and me</EM>.&rdquo; Mr. Colwell also stated: &ldquo;<EM>We have no idea what Columbus notes are, and simply followed your instructions for the wire transfers</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;33&rdquo; is a copy of the December 12, 2008 email from Mr. Colwell to Mr. Garcia (Trial Exhibit 3).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. Mr. Garcia used Ms. Roberts' stamp to register the Columbus Notes as having been received or &lsquo;booked&rsquo; by Union. In her Trial Affidavit, Ms. Roberts said she had no knowledge of the Columbus Notes or any Columbus investment and stated &ldquo;<EM>The foolishness of the exercise was the fact we do not receive securities by placing a stamp on the certificate</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;34&rdquo; is an excerpt from the Trial Affidavit of Heather Roberts (Trial Exhibit 4).</BOLD></P1></P>

Some research, some he put you know to try to you know to raise some capital for, for, you know for certain things that I had in mind, for example Genesis but he never raised money anyway for that</EM>.&rdquo; Garcia confirmed that payments of $800,000 from Columbus to Morales were made &ldquo;<EM>because we have dealings, you know, private dealings with, with Mr. de Leon, I told you that the other day</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;39&rdquo; is an excerpt from the transcript of the October 18, 2013 examination.</BOLD></P1></P>

<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;40&rdquo; is an excerpt from the transcript of the November 7, 2013 examination.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>52. At paragraph 403 of his Trial Affidavit, Mr. Garcia states for the first time that Morales was his uncle, stating &ldquo;<EM>I asked Duscio to pay my commissions to my uncle in Guatemala, a retired banker named Nicolas De Leon Morales</EM>.&rdquo; At paragraph 404 his Trial Affidavit, Mr. Garcia disclosed a series of payments to Morales totaling USD $1,112,763.00.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;41&rdquo; is an excerpt from Mr. Garcia's Trial Affidavit (Trial Exhibit 10).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>53. According to Mr. Garcia, he previously had an agreement in 2015 with Morales to borrow funds as required to fund his litigation.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;42&rdquo; is a copy of the agreement, along with a copy of the answers to undertakings given during the October 26, 2018 cross-examination of Mr. Garcia.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Behaviour During Litigation</TI>
<P>54. Cajubi's statement of claim was filed against the Garcias and their companies in 2011. The Garcias filed their statement of defence and counterclaim on October 12, 2011. Since that time, there have been numerous decisions released, numerous motions and findings made against the Garcias. There have also been repeated allegations made by the Garcias against Cajubi, its lawyers and the other defendants involved in these proceedings.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;43&rdquo; is a copy of the Garcias' statement of defence.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Findings from the Commercial Court</EM></TI>
<P>55. On April 15, 2013, the Garcias' counsel were permitted to remove themselves from the record. The Garcias were ordered to appoint new counsel and failed to do so. Cajubi moved to strike their statement of defence and counterclaim. New counsel came on the record &ldquo;<EM>just as the clock was about to strike midnight and the plaintiff had been put to significant expense. Those defendants had the better part of two months to retain counsel, yet left it to the last minute</EM>.&rdquo; Justice Brown also stated that &ldquo;<EM>Mr. Garcia deposed that he has little in the way of funds; Newbould J. made observations to the contrary</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;44&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Brown dated November 1, 2013.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. On November 6, 2013, Justice Brown made an endorsement requiring the Garcias to present themselves for examination for discovery, stating: &ldquo;<EM>from what I have heard I think they are avoiding the examinations</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;45&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Brown dated November 6, 2013.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. In a case conference memorandum dated June 10, 2014, Justice Brown noted that the Garcias had not obeyed a production order made at an earlier case conference, with only &ldquo;<EM>Some documents ... produced by the Garcia defendants a few hours before yesterday's case conference</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;46&rdquo; is a copy of the case conference memorandum dated June 10, 2014.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. In an endorsement dated January 5, 2015, Justice Penny found that Cajubi was the beneficial owner of the units in the GLD land pool, and ordered that the title of the units be delivered to Cajubi. In this endorsement, he noted that &ldquo;<EM>The Garcias have never advanced a substantive justification for holding on to the shares or not consenting to the relief sought on the motion</EM>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<EM>The Garcias position has unnecessarily added cost to the Plaintiff's recovery and, frankly, seems to have been calculated to have that effect</EM>...&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;47&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Penny dated January 5, 2015 with transcription.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>59. In an endorsement dated January 20, 2015, Justice Penny found that as Mr. Garcia had already undergone one examination for discovery in English, he did not require a Spanish interpreter at subsequent examinations: &ldquo;<EM>He has sworn under oath that he did not require an interpreter</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;48&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Penny dated January 20, 2015 with transcription.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>60. In an endorsement dated March 24, 2017, Justice Wilton-Siegel ruled against the Garcias in their motion seeking security for costs against Cajubi. He stated &ldquo;<EM>I conclude that the only reasonable explanation for the decision of the Garcia Defendants to bring the motion at this late stage in the action is to seek once again to frustrate the Plaintiff in one last attempt to make this action settle or go away entirely</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;49&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Wilton-Siegel regarding the Motion for Security for Costs dated March 24, 2017.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. In an endorsement dated March 24, 2017, Justice Wilton-Siegel stated, &ldquo;<EM>The Garcia Defendants have engaged in conduct in this litigation designed to delay the progress of the action and increase the costs of the plaintiff</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;50&rdquo; is a copy of the Endorsement of Justice Wilton-Siegel regarding a motion brought by Cajubi to enforce a settlement on a motion for contempt dated March 24, 2017.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>

<P>62. In October 2014, Mr. Garcia wrote letters addressed to, among others, the director of Itaipu (the parent company of Cajubi), INTERPOL, the RCMP, the US Department of Justice, the Department of Justice Canada, and the Ontario Securities Commission with the heading alleging that &ldquo;<EM>Cajubi continues paying lawyers in Toronto to cover-up the corrupt mafia</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;51&rdquo; is a copy of the October 10, 2014 letter with translation (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. On April 28, 2015, Mr. Garcia wrote to the RCMP alleging misconduct against Cajubi, claiming &ldquo;<EM>Itaipu does as it pleases in Canada: First it launders money and then it retains Shibley Righton LLP's Jacqueline L. King and Sandra Dawe to &lsquo;recover it</EM>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;52&rdquo; is a copy of the April 28, 2015 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. On April 29, 2015, Mr. Garcia wrote to the Law Society alleging that six lawyers at Shibley &ldquo;<EM>might be involved directly or indirectly in money laundering and/or corruption and/or tax evasion</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;53&rdquo; is a copy of the April 29, 2015 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>65. On June 29, 2015, Mr. Garcia wrote to the Canada Revenue Agency alleging that Shibley's lawyers had engaged in tax fraud by, among other things, failing to forward tax related to the recovery of the GLD land units.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;54&rdquo; is a copy of the June 29, 2015 letter (Trial Exhibit 1).</BOLD></P1></P>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias' Campaign of Harassment against the other Defendants</EM></TI>
<P>67. Mr. Hibbs stated in his Trial Affidavit that the Garcias made complaints about him and Mr. Colwell to IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada). Anonymous manila envelopes also arrived at his new employer's office, making allegations that he was involved in criminal activity and someone contacted BNN (Business News Network), where Mr. Hibbs regularly appeared, making the same allegations.
<P1><BOLD>See Exhibit &ldquo;18&rdquo; at paras. 79&ndash;93.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>68. Likewise, in his Trial Affidavit, Mr. Wadsworth noted that thirteen anonymous packages were delivered to his employer, containing defamatory allegations against him, along with a page that said &ldquo;<EM>ALERT: Ontario man, Brian Wadsworth ... involved in a massive scheme against a Paraguayan pension fund. Mr Wadsworth currently works at Industrial Alliance</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>See Exhibit &ldquo;20&rdquo; at paras. 120&ndash;123 and Exhibit &ldquo;20A.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>69. Likewise, Mr. Garcia made complaints against Mr. Tsimidis to the OSC, RCMP and the Institute of Professional Accountants of Ontario, as well as sending manila envelopes to their (he and his colleagues') &ldquo;<EM>business associates, families and even to one of our kid's coaches of the hockey team</EM>.&rdquo; The Garcias also made repeated and numerous allegations against him and his colleagues on the Garcias' website.
<P1><BOLD>See Exhibit &ldquo;13&rdquo; at paras. 66&ndash;68.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>70. Mr. Tsimidis also noted that anonymous packages were delivered to his employer, containing defamatory allegations against him, along with a page that said &ldquo;<EM>ALERT: Toronto businessmen, Nick Tsimidis, Paolo Abate and Jason Monaco involved in massive criminal scheme against Paraguayan pension fund. They were investigated by the MDFA and the regulator imposed sanctions... on a related matter</EM>.&rdquo; The &lsquo;Alert&rsquo; also stated that Mr. Tsimidis was currently a principal at &ldquo;<EM>HAVEN Developments</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>See Exhibit &ldquo;13A.&rdquo;</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Proposed Witness List</EM></TI>

<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;56&rdquo; is a copy of the Garcias' proposed witness list.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Motion to Vary Non-Dissipation Order History</TI>
<P>72. Mr. Garcia swore his affidavit in support of his initial motion to vary the non-dissipation order on October 22, 2018. He was cross-examined on his affidavit on October 26, 2018.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;57&rdquo; are excerpts of the transcript of the October 26, 2018 examination of Mr. Garcia.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. As stated above, the Non-Dissipation Order required that the Garcias produce sworn affidavits of assets by June 6, 2018. The Garcias have still not produced sworn affidavits of assets.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Garcias' Unsworn Affidavit of Assets Failed to Disclose an Account with Morales</TI>
<P>74. At paragraph 18 of his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy stated that neither of the Garcias &ldquo;<EM>has had any substantial income not derived from their dealings with the plaintiff</EM>...&rdquo;</P>
<P>75. The Garcias have continued to live off Cajubi's funds with the money they diverted. They have not provided any evidence disclosing another source of income from 2009 to present (with the exception of Mrs. Garcia's recent employment at Nature's Pharmacy).
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;58&rdquo; is a chart showing the Garcias' income from 2007 to 2017 taken from their tax returns.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>76. The Non-Dissipation Order included an obligation on third parties to disclose financial information about the Garcias. Pursuant to that Order, the Bank of Montreal (&ldquo;BMO&rdquo;) produced bank statements for two accounts. One of the accounts belonged to 2388568 Ontario Inc., which was a company the Garcias and Morales had together. The Garcias had not listed 2388568 Ontario Inc. or this bank account in their unsworn June 15, 2018 affidavit of assets.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;59&rdquo; is a copy of the BMO account statements for 2388568 Ontario Inc.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>77. The Garcias explained this, stating it was an error of their lawyers and rely on an email they sent to their counsels' office on October 18, 2018 stating &ldquo;<EM>there is also two checking accts at BMO: #242</EM>[#omitted] <EM>under 2388568 ONTARIO INC (linked to the GIC on which Mr. DeLeon has signing authority); and #242</EM>[#omitted] <EM>under 2388572 ONTARIO INC. I think we should mention these two accts in the affidavit too</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;60&rdquo; is an email from Mr. Garcia to his counsels' office dated October 18, 2018 (Tab 3B in his affidavit sworn October 22, 2018).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>78. The BMO statements for the 2388568 Ontario Inc. bank account show various payments out of that account to Garcia Genesis. The funds were deposited in an account with Your Neighbourhood Credit Union (&ldquo;YNCU&rdquo;). Mr. Garcia's unsworn June 15, 2018 affidavit of assets did not disclose an account at YNCU. Records for the YNCU account were produced at Cajubi's request on Sunday October 28, 2018.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;61&rdquo; is a copy of the YNCU account statements for Garcias' company, Genesis (LA) Corp.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Purpose</TI>
<P>79. As stated above, the trial of this action proceeded as a hybrid, with parties preparing Trial Affidavits. The Trial Affidavits referenced to in my affidavit, along with all their attached exhibits, were entered as numbered Trial Exhibits.
<P1><BOLD>Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;62&rdquo; is a copy of the Trial Exhibit List.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>80. I swear this affidavit in support of Cajubi's response to the Garcias' motion on appeal and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PARTS I &amp; II&mdash;OVERVIEW AND FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The applicants, Eduardo Garcia, Patricia Garcia, Managed (Portfolio), Corp., Genesis (La), Corp. (Ontario Corporation Number 1653094), Genesis (La), Corp. (Alberta Corporate Access Number 2013145921), Fc Int, Corp., and First Canadian Int, Corp. (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Garcia Appellants</BOLD>&rdquo;), seek $150,000 of non-proprietary funds, which are currently frozen (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Appeal Funds</BOLD>&rdquo;) for the purpose of funding their appeal of Justice Dunphy's trial decision, dated October 12, 2018, (with corrections on October 24, 2018) (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Judgment</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal, dated November 12, 2018, Motion Record of the Garcia Appellants, dated January 24, 2019, Tab B 5 (&ldquo;Moving Parties' Record&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Dunphy's Judgment found the Garcia Appellants liable to the respondent for $20,843,888.</P>
<P>2. Prior to release of the Judgment, at the end of the 16-day trial of the action, the respondent brought a motion for an order preventing the Garcia Appellants from dissipating any funds or assets pending the rendering of the Judgment, and for certain other ancillary relief.</P>
<P>3. Justice Dunphy granted the respondent's motion on or about May 23, 2018, ordering the Garcia Appellants' worldwide assets frozen, and preventing the Garcia Appellants from dissipating their assets in any way (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Non-Dissipation Order</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Parties' Record, Tab 4 A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Non-Dissipation Order remains in force pending satisfaction of the $20,843,888 Judgment and is incorporated by reference to the Judgment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Parties' Record, B 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. As a result of the Non-Dissipation Order, all of the Garcias' assets are frozen. To effectively appeal the Judgment, the Garcia Appellants brought a motion before Justice Dunphy, returnable October 31, 2018, to vary the Non-Dissipation Order, seeking access to the Appeal Funds primarily for the purpose of funding their appeal and pay counsel (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Varying Motion</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. While Justice Dunphy ultimately dismissed the Varying Motion, His Honour did so without prejudice to the appellants' right to seek similar relief before the Court of Appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at para 56(e).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As such, the Garcia Appellants now move before this Honourable Court seeking to stay the Non-Dissipation Order to allow access to the Appeal Funds, or for interim relief to access such funds.</P>
<P>6. The Appeal Funds sought by the Garcia Appellants before Justice Dunphy, and now before this Honourable Court, are non-proprietary and have been traced into the Garcias' home, located at [location omitted] (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Falconridge Property</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at para 38; Moving Parties' Record, Tab B at para 10; Moving Parties Record, Tab B 4 at paras 8&ndash;11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Given that the sale of the property may take some time, the Garcia Appellants have also moved to liquidate a Guaranteed Investment Certificate held at the Bank of Montreal, which was valued at approximately $350,068.56 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>GIC</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Parties' Record, Tab B at para 10; Moving Parties Record, Tab B 4 at paras 8&ndash;11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Any excess funds from either (or both) of these two sources was proposed to be paid into court, pending disposition on appeal.</P>
<P>7. That there are non-proprietary funds available to the Garcia Appellants is uncontroverted. In his decision on the Varying Motion, Justice Dunphy concluded:
<QUOTE><P>I am satisfied that the moving parties have shown that at least $143,000 of the down payment for [the Falconridge Property is] derived from sources that the plaintiff has not established a proprietary claim to.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at paras 37-38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. With respect to whether the Garcia Appellants may have had access to &ldquo;other assets&rdquo; with which they could fund their appeal, Justice Dunphy somewhat paradoxically concluded that there may be some sources potentially open for use by the Garcias to fund their appeal,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but elsewhere concluded that any assets not disclosed, and/or open for use by the appellants, &ldquo;would be subject to my [Non-Dissipation Order] and thus be unavailable to fund appeal or living expenses...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at para 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Despite his findings, Justice Dunphy declined to deal with the issue in its entirety, instead directing the Garcia Appellants to the Court of Appeal to decide the issue of accessing the Appeal Funds.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P>10. The sole issue to be determined on this motion is whether the Court of Appeal should exercise its broad discretion under s. 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSO 1990, c C43 [<EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> granting an order preventing prejudice to the appellants pending appeal, or alternatively, under Rule 63.02(1)(b) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RRO 1990, Reg 194 [<EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> granting an order staying the Non-Dissipation Order to allow access to the Appeal Funds.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART IV&mdash;LAW and ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>THE TEST FOR GRANTING THE REQUESTED ORDER</TI>
<P>11. The test for granting an order preventing prejudice to the Garcia Appellants pending their appeal of the Judgment, or granting a stay of the Non-Dissipation Order, is the same under either s 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, or Rule 63.02(1).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Abuzour v Heydary</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 249</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Abuzour</EM>], Moving Parties' Book of Authorities, dated February 26, 2019 (&ldquo;Moving Authorities) at Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is based on the tripartite test, originally set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>RJR MacDonald Inc. v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[1994] 1 SCR 311 [.<EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>], Moving Authorities at Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>:
<P1>(1) whether there is a serious question to be tried;</P1>
<P1>(2) whether the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the application were refused; and</P1>
<P1>(3) whether the balance of convenience favours the applicant (i.e. the applicant would suffer greater harm if the stay were not granted than the respondent would suffer if the stay were granted).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>RJR-MacDonald, ibid</EM>, at 334.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>12. The elements of the tripartite test are governed by the overriding concern of ensuring the interests of justice are achieved. As Justice Laskin previously held, &ldquo;the components of the test are interrelated in the sense that the overriding question is whether the moving party has shown that it is in the interests of justice to grant a stay.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>BTR Global Opportunity Trading Limited v RBC Dexia Investor Services Trust</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 620</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Moving Authorities at Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Justice Perell in his decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bruno Appliance and Furniture Inc. v Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2011 ONSC 1305 [<EM>Bruno Appliance</EM>], Moving Authorities at Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reviewed the court's jurisdiction to make interim order to prevent prejudice under section 134(2), citing his text, <EM>The Law of Civil Procedure in Ontario</EM>, and noting:
<QUOTE><P>[38] <EM>Section 134(2) has the same purpose as the provisions in Rule 63, which enable a judge of the appellate court to impose or to remove a stay, but the power is wider than that conferred by Rule 63. Section 134(2) provides a broad-based jurisdiction to make interim orders pending an appeal. The section addresses those situations for which no specific remedy has been provided by the Courts of Justice Act or the Rules of Civil Procedure and some form of judicial intervention is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party to the appeal. The provision is designed to prevent a situation where the appellant might be successful on the appeal but find that this result has been rendered nugatory</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bruno Appliance, ibid</EM>, citing P.M. Perell and J.W. Morden, <EM>The Law of Civil Procedure in Ontario</EM> (Markham: LexisNexis, 2010) at p 803, at para 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. The jurisdiction under section 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> is broad and focuses on preventing prejudice in the context of an appeal. As this Honourable Court has previously held, the prejudice sought to be avoided must relate to a party's ability to meaningfully participate in the appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Waxman v Waxman</SOC><CITE>[2003] OJ No 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 21 [<EM>Waxman</EM>], Moving Authorities at Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. As a result of the Non-Dissipation Order, and Justice Dunphy's decision on the Varying Motion, the Garcia Appellants do not have access to any funds with which they can puruse their appeal.</P>
<P>16. On the Varying Motion, the respondent alleged the Garcia Appellants may have access to other assets, including Mr. Garcia's mother's home in Guatemala, and any funds held with one Mr. Nicolas De Leon Morales, an associate of Mr. Garcia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 3 at paras 22, 28&ndash;30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, pursuant to the Non- Dissipation Order, if even the Garcia Appellants could access them, such funds are frozen and cannot be accessed by them.</P>
<P>17. The Garcia Appellants have deposed and established that they do not have access to other funds. They have set out their dire financial situation since the Judgment, including having to attend a food bank in Kitchener, Waterloo in order to provide food for their family.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Eduardo Garcia, sworn February 11, 2019, (&ldquo;Garcia Affidavit&rdquo;) Tab 1, at para 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The funds held by Mr. Garcia's mother in Guatemala, and those held by Mr. Nicolas De Leon Morales are not available to the Garcia Appellants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Eduardo Garcia, sworn February 11, 2019, (&ldquo;Garcia Affidavit&rdquo;) Tab 1, at paras 32&ndash;45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. What is paramount is ensuring the interests of justice are achieved in exercising the discretion to order a stay of the Non-Dissipation Order. If a stay is not ordered, and access to the Appeal Funds is denied, the Garcia Appellants will suffer grave prejudice. It will no longer be a matter of not being able to <EM>meaningfully</EM> participate in their appeal, they will be estopped from participating in their appeal <EM>in any capacity</EM>. Even if self-represented, they will not have access to funds to order transcripts from trial.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Element One: There is a serious question to be tried</EM></TI>
<P>20. The threshold to establishing whether there is a serious question to be tried is a low one.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 334.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Honourable Court has cautioned that an extensive review of the merits of the appeal is not called for at this stage of the test. Rather, the court must determine whether the issues raised are vexatious or frivolous<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of Ontario v Shehrazad Non-Profit Housing Inc.</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 267</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Shehrazad</EM>], citing with approval <CASEREF><SOC>Circuit World Cup v Lesperance</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>33 OR 3(d) 674</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Moving Authorities at Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. As set out by this Court in <EM>Abuzour</EM>, the motion judge need not conclude that the appellants have a strong argument or that they will succeed on appeal, rather he or she must find that the appeal is neither vexatious nor frivolous<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Abuzour</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. In their Notice of Appeal, the Garcia Appellants have set out numerous grounds on which to appeal the Judgment. Such grounds include, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that Justice Dunphy erred in assessing damages against the Garcia Appellants, that he ignored, or otherwise failed, to consider certain of the Garcia Appellants' defences, and that he misapprehended, or otherwise failed, to consider relevant evidence before him.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal, dated November 12, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, Tab B 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. An essential ground of appeal, as set out in their Notice, is the trial judge's failure to address the overriding limitations defence, which was specifically plead and argued at trial, but which forms no basis of the trial Judgment.</P>
<P>24. In addition to the limitations defence, the Garcia Appellants specifically amended their statement of defence, on consent, during trial to add defences of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> based on the corporate identification doctrine. The corporate identification doctrine was a central part of the Garcia Appellants' defence from pleadings through to trial and occupied a large portion of oral argument before the trial judge.</P>
<P>25. The existence, and importance, of the corporate identification doctrine in the context of the defence of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> has been set out clearly by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2017 SCC 63, Moving Authorities at Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Given the importance of the Garcia Appellants' defences, including an overriding limitations defence, the trial judge's failure to address these issues in his Judgment underlies the seriousness of the questions to be tried on appeal. Such failure makes clear the within appeal is neither vexatious nor frivolous.</P>
<P>27. The question before this Honourable Court at this stage, is not whether the Garcia Appellants have a strong argument, or whether they will succeed on appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Abuzour</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Garcia Appellants' appeal is neither vexatious nor frivolous and that is sufficient at this stage to establish a serious issue to be tried.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Element Two: The Garcia Appellants will suffer irreparable harm</EM></TI>
<P>28. The Supreme Court has held that &lsquo;irreparable harm&rsquo; in the context of the <EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM> test is that which &ldquo;either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or which cannot be cured.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at 341.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, evidence of irreparable harm, &ldquo;must be clear and not speculative&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Shehrazad</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. In <CASEREF><SOC>The Corporation of the City of Peterborough v Kawartha Native Housing Society Incorporated et al</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>(2009), 99 OR (3d) 573 [<EM>Peterborough</EM>], Moving Authorities at Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Blair of this Honourable Court relied on s 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> in ordering that a party was entitled to retain and fund counsel out of funds that were at issue in the underlying proceedings. In doing so, Justice Blair held:
<QUOTE><P>[5] Here, the boards' ability to pursue the important issues that are raised on the appeal would be hollow in the extreme if they are not in a position to retain and properly pay legal counsel. The appeal cannot be effectively prepared, presented and argued on behalf of the corporations without the benefit of counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Peterborough</EM>, <EM>ibid</EM>, at para 5;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. In his affidavit, Mr. Garcia has deposed that he has no access to other funds on which the Garcia Appellants may rely to fund the within-appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Garcia Affidavit, Tab 1, at paras 32&ndash;45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Mr. Garcia has confirmed that without access to the Appeal Funds sought on the within-motion, the Garcia Appellants will be without counsel and therefore unable to effectively pursue their appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Garcia Affidavit, Tab 1, at para 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. As in <EM>Peterborough</EM>, given that the Garcia Appellants do not have access to any other funds from which to fund their appeal, if the Appeal Funds are not granted pursuant to this Honourable Court's discretion under s 134(2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, or, alternatively, Rule 63.02 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, their ability to pursue the important issues raised on appeal is hollow. The appeal will not be effectively prepared, if prepared at all, and the Garcia Appellants will suffer a corresponding irreparable harm.</P>
<P>32. The inability to pursue their rights on appeal is certainly of the nature of harm that can be neither quantified in monetary terms, nor cured.</P>
<P>33. The irreparable harm suffered by the Garcia Appellants is not speculative, it is clear, established as a matter of fact, and by Mr. Garcia's sworn affidavit.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Element Three: The balance of convenience favours the Garcia Appellants</EM></TI>
<P>34. This Honourable Court has repeatedly held that this stage of the <EM>RJR-MacDonald</EM> analysis requires determining which party will suffer the greater harm from granting or refusing a stay or order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Abuzour</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 33; <EM>Shehrazad</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. There can be no question that the Garcia Appellants will suffer serious harm and prejudice should the within motion be denied.</P>
<P>36. The inability to access the Appeal Funds pursuant to an order of this Honourable Court means that the appellants have no other funds with which they can conduct their appeal. The result will therefore be an inability to pursue their appeal, safeguard their rights, and potentially restore their tarnished reputations.</P>
<P>37. With respect to any harm that may occur to the respondent, such harm would certainly pale in comparison to that suffered by the Garcia Appellants.</P>
<P>38. In weighing the balance of convenience, it is important to consider the amount sought for appeal, versus the size of the Judgment against the Garcia Appellants. The Garcia Appellants stand to face a judgment of approximately $20 million and are seeking $150,000 in order to appeal.</P>
<P>39. Further, as set out in their Notice of Appeal, the losses suffered by the respondent cannot be entirely attributed to the Garcia Appellants. The Judgment itself holds that the respondent's own president, vice president and treasurer were intimately involved in perpetrating a fraud against it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 2, paras 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. While Justice Dunphy, in his decision on the Varying Motion, held that his Judgment against the Garcia Appellants exceeds any estimate of what is likely to be collected,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Garcia Appellants are not now asking for a windfall of funds with which they intend to live a lavish lifestyle or otherwise dissipate irresponsibly.</P>
<P>41. The Garcia Appellants are seeking access to $150,000 in demonstrably non-proprietary funds. The purpose the funds is not for living, or other such related, expenses&mdash;it is solely for legal fees. The Garcia Appellants will use the Appeal Funds solely to appeal the Judgment and preserve their rights.</P>
<P>42. While the harm to the respondent must be considered at this stage of the test,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Shehrazad</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the effect of an order from this Honourable court granting the Garcia Appellants access to the Appeal Funds would have only a minor impact on the ability of the respondent to collect any monies still found owing to it by the Garcia Appellants pending disposition of the within appeal.</P>
<P>43. From the sale of the Falconridge Property alone, the Garcia Appellants will pay approximately $350,000 into court after securing the Appeal Funds. A further $350,000 will be available rom the GIC at the Bank of Montreal.</P>
<P>44. The Garcia Appellants have maintained that their request for the Appeal Funds is not open- ended and they will seek no further funds to conduct their appeal before this Honourable Court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Garcia Affidavit, Tab 1, at 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. The harm suffered by the Garcia Appellants if the relief is not granted will far outweigh any harm suffered by the respondent if the requested relief is granted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>VARYING THE NON-DISSIPATION ORDER</TI>
<P>46. As set out by this Court in <EM>Waxman</EM>, the principles applicable to the specific remedies sought pursuant to an order under s 134(2) will play a central role in deciding whether an order shall be granted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Waxman</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. As such, it is necessary to briefly set out the test to vary Justice Dunphy's Non-Dissipation Order, in the event this Honourable Court exercises its discretion to grant an order pursuant to s 134(2) or Rule 63.02.</P>
<P>48. In his decision on the Varying Motion, Justice Dunphy held that the applicable test to consider in determining whether to vary the Non-Dissipation Order was the four-part test set out by the court in <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v Credit Valley Institute of Business and Technology</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[2003] OJ No 40 [<EM>Credit Valley</EM>], Moving Authorities at Tab 9; Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. The <EM>Credit Valley</EM> test examines the following questions:
<P1>(i) Has the moving party established on the evidence that there are no other assets available to pay the expenses other than those frozen by the injunction?</P1>
<P1>(ii) Has the moving party shown on the evidence that there are assets caught by the injunction that are from a source other than the plaintiff and thus non subject to the plaintiffs <EM>proprietary</EM> claims?</P1>
<P1>(iii) Has the moving party exhausted any non-proprietary assets before looking to assets subject to a proprietary claim?</P1>
<P1>(iv) Does the balance of convenience favour the moving party's claim?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Credit Valley</EM>, <EM>ibid</EM>, at para 26, Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3 at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>50. While it is somewhat beyond the scope of the within-motion to engage in a full-fledged analysis of the <EM>Credit Valley</EM> test, Justice Dunphy's reasons on the Varying Motion are somewhat helpful in curtailing the analysis.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>No other Assets</EM></TI>
<P>51. In his reasons, Justice Dunphy found that there appear to be &ldquo;sources&rdquo; that &ldquo;are or ought reasonably to be potentially open to the Garcia [Appellants].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B3, para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Dunphy further elucidates that such alleged sources may be a home in Guatemala, which is owned by Mr. Garcia's mother, and/or funds sent to Mr. de Leon Morales.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, paras 27&ndash;29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. However, Justice Dunphy specifically found that both of these alleged sources are funds that the respondent would have a proprietary claim to in any event<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, paras 28-29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Per the <EM>Credit Valley</EM> test, it is first necessary for the moving party to establish whether there are non-proprietary funds available.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Credit Valley</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. In any event, as set out in Mr. Garcia's affidavit on the within-motion, the Garcia Appellants do no have access to any other funds besides those subject to the Non-Dissipation Order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Garcia Affidavit, Tab 1, paras 32&ndash;46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. The Garcia Appellants have provided all bank records, account statements, and anything else as ordered by the Non-Dissipation Order and requested by the respondent in its tracing efforts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Garcia Affidavit, Tab 1, para 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. The Non-Dissipation Order continues to operate to freeze the Garcia Appellants' worldwide assets.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order of Justice Dunphy. dated May 14, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, B 1 at para 1(a).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. It is trite that where an injunction is a world-wide freezing order over all of a party's assets, the party can have no other assets other than those subject to, and frozen by, the freezing order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Insurance Corp. of British Columbia v Dragon Driving School Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2004 BCSC 1580</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Moving Authorities at Tab 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>57. Despite Justice Dunphy's comments otherwise, it is clear that there are no other sources from which the Garcia Appellants can draw to fund their appeal.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Availability of Non-Proprietary Funds</EM></TI>
<P>58. On the Varying Motion, Justice Dunphy had before him a detailed set of financial statements which were reviewed in court to demonstrate the existence of certain non-proprietary funds available to the Garcia Appellants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, paras 31&ndash;38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. After reviewing in detail the financials before him, Justice Dunphy concluded that he was &ldquo;satisfied that the [Garcia Appellants] have shown that at least $143,000 of the down payment for their home derived from sources that the [respondent] has not established a proprietary claim to.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, para 38 [<EM>emphasis added</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. The respondent did not appeal Justice Dunphy's finding with respect to the $143,000 of non-proprietary funds, and as such it stands that the Garcia Appellants have established a claim to a minimum of $143,000 of nonproprietary funds.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Exhausted Non-Proprietary Funds</EM></TI>
<P>61. As a result of Justice Dunphy's decision to have this Honourable Court deal with the Garcia Appellants' access to the Appeal Funds, the appellants have not been provided access to the nonproprietary funds and have therefore not exhausted them.</P>
<P>62. Further, as Justice Dunphy held, &ldquo;I have found that at least $143,000 of the funds used to purchase the [Falconridge Property] are not subject to the plaintiffs proprietary claim.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of Justice Dunphy, dated November 1, 2018, Moving Parties' Record, at Tab B 3, para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(iv)</EM></N><TI><EM>Balance of Convenience</EM></TI>
<P>63. For the reasons set out in the balance of convenience section, above, the Garcia Appellants maintain that the balance of convenience weighs in their favour.</P>
<P>64. In order for the Garcia Appellants to be able to pursue their rights on appeal, they will need access to the Appeal Funds. Such funds are not being sought for non-essential expenses, have been limited to a request for funds from non-proprietary sources, and have been capped. There is no open-ended, ongoing, request for funds to conduct the within-appeal.</P>
<P>65. If this Honourable Court declines to exercise its jurisdiction to allow access to the Appeal Funds, the Garcia Appellants will effectively be denied their appeal.</P>
<P>66. The Garcia Appellants have met the test set out under s 134(2) and Rule 63.02, and have established entitlement to non-proprietary funds per <EM>Credit Valley</EM>. The balance of convenience weighs in favour of exercising discretion under either s 134(2) or Rule 63.02.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED AND ESTIMATED TIME</TI>
<P>67. The Garcia Appellants request that their motion is granted, with costs against the plaintiff on whatever scale this Honourable Court deems appropriate.</P>
<P>68. The Garcia Appellants estimate that they require 45 minutes to argue the within motion.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF CAJUBI (RESPONDENT) (Motion returnable March 8, 2019)</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Garcias purported to act for Cajubi as their &ldquo;<EM>investment advisor</EM>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<EM>investment agents</EM>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>agent</EM>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>2. Caja Paraguay de Jubilaciones y Pensiones del Personal de Itaipu Binacional (&ldquo;Cajubi&rdquo;) is a pension fund established in 1988 by legislation in Paraguay for the purpose of providing pension benefits for the Paraguayan employees of Itaipu Binacional, a hydroelectric generating station.</P>
<P>3. After a change in its Board of Directors, Cajubi discovered irregularities in its investments. It was uncovered that the Garcias and three of Cajubi's directors had been funnelling monies for its investments to persons and entities other than for the purported investments.</P>
<P>4. On May 14, 2018, Justice Dunphy made a verbal finding from the bench, after 16 days of trial, that the Garcias, (as Managed (Portfolio), Corp., First Canadian Int, Corp., Genesis (LA), Corp. and Genesis (LA), Corp., Eduardo Garcia a.k.a Eduardo Garcia Obregon, a.k.a. Eddie Obregon and Patricia Garcia, a.k.a. Claudia Patricia Garcia, a.k.a. Claudia Santisteban, a.k.a. Claudia Patricia De Garcia) (collectively, the &ldquo;Garcias&rdquo;) were liable to Cajubi for civil fraud in the amount of not less than $10 million with reasons and his final determination of damages to follow. Justice Dunphy also issued a verbal non-dissipation order freezing the Garcias' assets.</P>
<P>5. On May 23, 2018, Justice Dunphy signed a formal non-dissipation and disclosure order against the Garcias (the &ldquo;Non-Dissipation Order&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. Justice Dunphy's Trial Reasons were released on October 12, 2018. He found the Garcias liable for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty in the amount of $20,843,888.00, over which he imposed a constructive trust. Punitive damages were also awarded against Mr. Garcia in the amount of $250,000 and Mrs. Garcia in the amount of $100,000, along with full indemnity costs.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy dated October 12, 2018, Garcia's Motion Record, Tab 2, at paras. 500&ndash;503, 509 (&ldquo;Trial Reasons&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. The Garcias brought a motion before Justice Dunphy to vary his Non-Dissipation Order to allow them access to $150,000 to fond their appeal against Cajubi. Justice Dunphy issued his Motion Reasons on November 1, 2018. He made findings but dismissed the motion without prejudice to the Garcias to seek their relief in the Court of Appeal.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Justice Dunphy dated November 1, 2018 at para. 36&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit, Ex 3. (&ldquo;Motion Reasons&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Background</EM></TI>
<P>8. The Garcias created contracts with Cajubi which represented them as Cajubi's &ldquo;<EM>investment advisor</EM>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<EM>investment agents</EM>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<EM>agent</EM>.&rdquo; Mr. Garcia and Mrs. Garcia admitted they are not, nor have they ever been, registered, licensed or authorized by any regulatory entities to provide investment advice. Mr. Garcia and Mrs. Garcia completed high school, but have no other educational degrees.
<P1><BOLD>Garcia Agreements&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit, Ex. 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. In the summary of conclusions in his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy stated:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[2] The plaintiff &ldquo;Cajubi&rdquo; is a Paraguayan pension fund with the misfortune to have had a president, vice president and treasurer who were prepared to help channel investment funds to parties willing to divert&mdash;secretly&mdash;large kickbacks out of Cajubi's own funds to offshore accounts at their direction. The Garcias were quite willing to pay such kickbacks in a confidential manner and showed themselves remarkably adept at fraudulently presenting their proposals to secure approvals for their investment proposals from Cajubi's Board. These three &ldquo;Insiders&rdquo; negotiated the amount of kickbacks, provided guidance to the Garcias on how best to structure their proposals to win the support of Cajubi's Board and how best to ensure the true nature of their dealings remained a closely guarded secret in the hopes that future profits might erase their tracks</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[3] The Garcias proposed three separate &ldquo;investment products&rdquo; to Cajubi's Board with the guidance of the Insiders. Each proposal purported to be advanced by one of three separate, regulated Canadian institutions: Genesis Land Development Corporation, First Canadian Capital Markets Ltd. and Union Securities Limited. Each was in fact made on behalf of a deceptively named shell company controlled by the individual Garcias</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[4] In each of the three cases, the fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Mr. Garcia followed broadly similar lines with only minor variations on the theme</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 2&ndash;4.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias Induced Cajubi To Make Investments Based on Falsified Information</EM></TI>
<P>10. Cajubi invested over $34,000,000 in Canada and lost their entire investment funds, aside from a modest amount recovered from settlements with other defendants.</P>
<P>11. The Garcias located regulated companies to invest Cajubi's money and then set up their own companies with similar names:

<P>12. The regulated companies provided the Garcias with various investments opportunities. The Garcias then presented these investment opportunities, misrepresenting the nature, risk and return of the investments to induce Cajubi to invest.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias Controlled All Communications between the regulated companies and Cajubi</EM></TI>
<P>13. The Garcias stood between the regulated companies and Cajubi, controlling all communications. Mr. Garcia convinced personnel from the companies that all communications had to flow through him. He controlled the responses to Cajubi's auditors in order to prevent the true value of Cajubi's investments from being discovered. The following is an indicative email exchange:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Dear Heather: you might get a fax (on 519 584 2611) from CAJUBI requesting us to send directly to BDO (their auditors) a status on their investments as of Sep-8, as soon as you receive it forward it to me so we can translate and prepare accordingly.

<P1><BOLD>Emails between Escurra and Garcia&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. Garcia had previously been known to Cajubi under the name Eduardo Garcia, through an investment with a company that ended up in CCAA proceedings. He only used the name &ldquo;Eddie Obregon&rdquo; in any communications that would be forwarded to the full board of Cajubi.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias' Wire Instructions Diverted Funds to their similarly-named Companies</EM></TI>
<P>17. The Garcias found an opportunity to request wire instruction to divert part of the investment monies to themselves. Escurra had emailed Garcia requesting that he provide the Board with the following explanation as to why a payment was to be made to both &ldquo;Genesis in Trust&rdquo; and to &ldquo;Jeffrey H. Larson in Trust.&rdquo; Escurra stated to Garcia: <EM>&ldquo;You must specify that it is a normal procedure, to regulate the issue of money laundering ... I think this is the last thing needed to close, and it is our only way to protect ourselves on paper regarding the circuit of money in two directions for one single purpose.&rdquo;</EM>
<P1><BOLD>April 13, 2007 email&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The Garcias provided Cajubi with wire instructions on forged and/or otherwise unauthorized letterhead of regulated companies. These instructions directed Cajubi to send funds for all investments to two different bank accounts; one portion to the account of the regulated company and the other portion to an account of the similarly named Garcia company &ldquo;ITF&rdquo; or &ldquo;<EM>In Trust for</EM>&rdquo; Cajubi.

<P>20. Despite being examined for discovery and cross-examined on nine separate occasions over numerous years, Mr. Garcia did not disclose, until just before trial, that Morales was his uncle. He previously gave the following explanations as to Morales' identity:

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Ron Timcke&mdash;Not Mentioned in Garcias' Defence or in any Cajubi Contracts yet was sent Millions of Cajubi's Money by the Garcias</EM></TI>
<P>21. The Garcias did not disclose to Cajubi in any documents that they were keeping the funds wired to the Garcias &ldquo;<EM>In Trust</EM>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<EM>ITF Cajubi</EM>.&rdquo; Mr. Garcia claimed that he transferred millions of dollars to Ron Timcke and his company Rio Conde through an account named Lemontree in Switzerland. In one email, Timcke told Mr. Garcia that Lemontree was a &ldquo;fictitious name.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Email from Timcke to Garcia dated April 30, 2007&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 26.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Nowhere in the Garcias' contracts with Cajubi is Timcke mentioned. Nowhere in any documentation regarding Cajubi's investments do the Garcias state that they have sent a large portion of the investment funds as a fee or otherwise to Timcke. It is unknown whether (like Morales) Timcke returned any of the millions of dollars of Cajubi's funds sent to him back to the Garcias.
<P1><BOLD>Statement of Defence of the Garcias&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Under examination, Garcia admitted that the name Ron Timcke does not appear on any contract with Cajubi. In fact, there is an email from Timcke to Mr. Garcia specifically requesting that Mr. Garcia not disclose his company to the investor:
<QUOTE><P><EM>...I'd like to ask you whether the name Rio Conde SA will show on an extract or other document received by the investor? If the answer is affirmative, is there a possibility that the intermediary Rio Conde would not show in any way? This is extremely important for us</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Evidence at Trial&mdash;Garcias call no Witnesses to Corroborate their Version of Events</EM></TI>
<P>24. Despite the fact that the Garcias informed the Court that they were calling 34 witnesses, not one witness was called by the Garcias to corroborate their testimony. Only Mr. and Mrs. Garcia testified.
<P1><BOLD>Garcia proposed witness list&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 56.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. At trial, witnesses from the regulated companies testified that the Garcias presented investments to Cajubi which&mdash;they only learned through the litigation&mdash;were different than the actual investments offered by their companies.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Union Securities&mdash;Marty Hibbs' Evidence</EM></TI>
<P>26. Mr. Hibbs was a licensed broker with Union, and dealt with Cajubi's investments. In his Trial Affidavit, he made the following comments in regards to information he later discovered was provided to Cajubi by Garcia, and which was purported to be from Union:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Some of the Illustrations have my name, on them along with my title at Union and Union's address. This, along with the fact the name &ldquo;Managed [Portfolio]&rdquo; makes it appear like they were prepared by Union, which they were not</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>I had no knowledge that my name was being used on a document prepared by Garcia and which provided inaccurate information about Cajubi's accounts. Significantly, it is not something that I or anyone at Union would produce. For example, if refers to a &ldquo;target annual return: 12&ndash;16%&rdquo;. I would never provide a target annual return in an account statement</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>In addition, these documents did not provide real or accurate information. For example, the Illustration for the period ending July 31, 2008 showed an opening balance of $14,239,990.00 and total gains to date of $169,319.33. However, by this point in time, Cajubi's account had lost $1.0 - $1.5 million</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Union Securities&mdash;Heather Roberts Evidence</EM></TI>
<P>27. Ms. Roberts was the branch administrator at Union. In her Trial Affidavit, she made the following comments in regards to information she later discovered was provided to Cajubi by Garcia, and which was purported to be from her:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Brian showed me an email he received from Rodriguez on September 22, 2010 asking if Brian was aware of an email address that read:</EM> &ldquo;[text omitted] [text omitted]&rdquo; <EM>Of course, I had absolutely no prior knowledge of that email address, nor would I have approved having email intended for me directed to an address out of my control</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Roberts Trial Affidavit, para 13&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 21.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Genesis Land Development Investment</EM></TI>
<P>28. Likewise, Mr. Garcia misstated the nature and value of the Genesis investment. The Genesis Land Development Investment was a project where investors bought vacant land which was to be developed over several years and sold (hopefully) for a profit. To date, there have not been any proceeds distributed to investors and the investment has lost nearly all of its value. Yet the Garcias provided statements to Cajubi over the years showing an &ldquo;<EM>Annual Rate</EM>&rdquo; of return for the investment and &ldquo;<EM>Gains for Current Month and Accrued Interest</EM>.&rdquo; The CEO of GLD, Stephen Griggs confirmed during trial that the investment never had monthly gains as that was not the nature of the investment.
<P1><BOLD>Statements of Account from the Garcias' Genesis Company&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. For example, the Garcias sent wire instructions which called for Cajubi to wire $400,000 to <EM>&ldquo;Genesis in Trust&rdquo;</EM> and $5.3 million to <EM>&ldquo;Jeffrey H.

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias' Campaign of Harassment</EM></TI>
<P>32. The Garcias have made numerous allegations against Cajubi and its counsel. They have made allegations of fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and corruption of foreign officials against six lawyers at Shibley Righton LLP to the Law Society, the RCMP, Fintract, Interpol, various Paraguay authorities, US authorities including the US Attorney General, Canada Revenue Agency and the United Nations. Below is a summary:
<P1>a) On October 10, 2014, Mr. Garcia wrote a letter addressed to numerous authorities including the RCMP, the U.S. and Canada Departments of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ontario Securities Commission, and Interpol. In the letter, Mr. Garcia alleges that &ldquo;<EM>Jacqueline L. King of the law firm Shibley Righton in Toronto; that woman, shamelessly continues to block the matters of Macheroni and Timcke and continues charging fees to Cajubi to recover what is practically unrecoverable</EM>.&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>October 10, 2014 letter&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 51.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>b) On April 28, 2015, Garcia wrote to the RCMP alleging that Shibley Righton's lawyers &ldquo;<EM>failed to disclose the names of those Paraguayan residents and the details of the money distribution from those bank accounts to the RCMP, Department of Justice Canada and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice</EM>&rdquo;. The letter also alleged that the RCMP engaged in misconduct, that it did not carry out its duties, and that the RCMP was &ldquo;<EM>teaming up</EM>&rdquo; with Shibley Righton in its overlooking of serious offenses.
<P2><BOLD>April 28, 2015 letter&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 52.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>c) Mr. Garcia's April 29, 2015 letter to the Law Society states that Jacqueline King, Sandra Dawe, Bill Northcote, John De Vellis, Tom McRae and Megan Marrie &ldquo;<EM>may be involved directly or indirectly in money laundering and/or corruption and/or tax evasion</EM>.&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>April 29, 2015 letter&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 53.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>d) In a June 29, 2015 letter Mr. Garcia wrote to CRA and the IRS, alleging that Shibley Righton cooperated in a failure to withhold taxes or to report events, stating specifically: &ldquo;<EM>There is no evidence that the lawful taxes were withheld and that Cajubi or Shibley Righton LLP has complied with the obligation of transferring that money to Canada Revenue Agency</EM>.&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>June 29, 2015 letter&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 54.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>e) In July 14, 2015, Mr. Garcia wrote to the Attorney General of Paraguay, alleging corruption, money laundering, illegal enrichment, and tax evasion on the part of Shibley Righton lawyers. Mr. Garcia also requested &ldquo;<EM>to immediately investigate six lawyers paid by the Ltaipu Fund from the Toronto Law Firm Shibley Righton LLP</EM>&rdquo; for &ldquo;<EM>hiding information, complicity, and other actions, omissions or similar maneuvers, in relation to the apparent Paraguayan crimes</EM>.&rdquo;

<P>33. In a similar fashion, the Garcias sent manila envelopes about numerous defendants to their families, neighbours and friends, calling them criminals. Numerous defendants recounted how these envelopes with allegations that they were involved in money laundering, etc., were sent to their banks, colleagues, offices of employment, and even to their adult children's employers and to younger children's sports teams.</P>
<P>34. Counsel to Cajubi also had manila envelopes sent to the firm's managing partner with numerous allegations and complaints.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcia's Pattern of Frivolous and Vexatious Litigation</EM></TI>
<P>35. On January 20, 2015, Mr. Garcia argued before Justice Penny that he needed an interpreter for his upcoming examination. Justice Penny found &ldquo;<EM>Mr. Garcia's examination shall take place in English. His prior discovery was conducted in English.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE ISSUES</TI>
<P>37. The issue in this Appeal is whether the Court should exercise its discretion to vary the Non-Dissipation Order to allow the Garcias to use Cajubi's funds to appeal against Cajubi. It is respectfully submitted that the Court must consider whether the Garcias have proven they have no other assets available, but more significantly, whether there are merits to their appeal of the Trial Judgment. There is no case law directly applicable as the Garcias have already had full opportunity to present their case after a sixteen day trial and the funds were only frozen after Judgment.</P>
<P>38. In his Motion Reasons, Justice Dunphy found that although the funds were only frozen <EM>after</EM> Judgment, the Mareva injunction framework was still an appropriate template for considering the manner in which the court's discretion ought to be applied.
<P1><BOLD>Motion Reasons, supra, at para. 20&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Legal Test</EM></TI>
<P>39. In <EM>Waxman</EM>, the Court of Appeal generally applied the test in <EM>Credit Valley</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Waxman v. Waxman</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 326 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 1 (&ldquo;<EM>Waxman</EM>&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. In <EM>Credit Valley</EM>, Justice Molloy held that when granting relief from a Mareva injunction, the defendant must satisfy the court that it has no other assets from which to make the required payments. Justice Molloy found that in the case of a proprietary injunction, the inquiry must go farther, stating:
<QUOTE><P><EM>It is one thing to permit payment of ordinary expenses out of money belonging to the defendant but which is frozen by a Mareva injunction. It is another thing altogether to permit the defendant to use the plaintiff's money for the purpose of attempting to defeat the plaintiff's claim</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Credit Valley Institute of Business and Technology</SOC><CITE>2003 CanLII 12916</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para. 20, Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 2 (&ldquo;<EM>Credit Valley</EM>&rdquo;).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The steps outlined by the Court of Appeal in <EM>Waxman</EM> (as enunciated in <EM>Credit Valley</EM>) are:
<P1>a) Has the defendant established on the evidence that he has no other assets available to pay his expenses other than those frozen by the injunction?</P1>
<P1>b) If so, has the defendant shown on the evidence that there are assets caught by the injunction that are from a source other than the plaintiff, i.e. assets that are subject to a Mareva injunction, but not a proprietary claim?</P1>
<P1>c) Is the defendant entitled to the use of non-proprietary assets frozen by the Mareva injunction to pay his living expenses, debts and legal costs? Those assets must be exhausted before the defendant is entitled to look to the assets subject to the proprietary claim.</P1>
<P1>d) <BOLD>If the defendant has met the previous test there must be a balancing of the competing interests of the plaintiff for not permitting the defendant to use the plaintiff's money for his own purposes and of the defendant in ensuring that he has a proper opportunity to present his defence before assets in his name are removed from him without a trial.</BOLD> In weighing the interests of the parties, it is relevant for the court to consider the strength of the plaintiff's case, as well as the extent to which the defendant has put forward an arguable case to rebut the plaintiff's claim.

<P>42. Mr. Garcia recently produced an agreement he claims to have had with (his uncle) Morales in 2015, stating that that he had permission to borrow funds from his uncle's money as required for litigation.

<P>43. Mr Garcia claimed that Morales <UNDER>may</UNDER> have been willing to provide him with funds for his appeal, but he was not sure as he did not pursue those discussions, [emphasis added)

<P>44. Mr. Garcia admitted that Morales received $1,620,193 throughout the relevant period. However, in his affidavit dated February 12, 2019, he stated that Morales sent back to Canada $1,395,864.64. It is unclear as to the reason the money came back, as Mr. Garcia claims it was put into a company (which Cajubi discovered after trial) to make investments. However the Garcias' company, Genesis (LA), showed total assets in 2017 of $1,971,830 and in 2016 of $2,047,647, along with a long term debt&mdash;allegedly owing to Morales&mdash;in 2017 of $1,093,534 and 2016 of $1,162,662.

<P>45. In regards to Morales, Justice Dunphy found:

<P>47. At one point, the Garcias claimed this was not their house, but that they loaned some money to purchase the house. Justice Dunphy found:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Mr. Garcia admits to having purchased a house for his mother with proceeds from Cajubi's funds some years ago. Cajubi has a proprietary claim in this house... the financial capacity of Mrs. Garcia's mother and family has not been developed before me in a meaningful way and I cannot assume that it is nil given the funds he is known to have provided her</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Motion Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 27.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>48. The Garcias recently disclosed that they had received $950 USD from Mrs. Garcia's mother. In addition, they recently disclosed they received $1,370 back from a criminal lawyer who was holding that amount in trust for them.

<P>49. The Garcias claimed they sent well over $4 million to Ron Timcke/Rio Conde. It is unclear whether this money also made its way back to the Garcias like most of the Morales monies did.
<P1><BOLD>Garcias Trial Affidavit, para. 6; Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 41.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. Courts expect parties to be candid about their ability to obtain funds from various sources; failure to do so can lead to a finding that the onus has not been met.

<P>51. Between October 19, 2017 and March 15, 2018, the Garcias' Genesis (LA), received at least $560,000 from Morales. Cajubi discovered this account, which was not listed in the Garcias' affidavit of assets, through its own investigation. The Garcias explained the inadvertence in failing to disclose an account with hundreds of thousands of dollars in it by saying they mentioned the account in an email to their counsel and somehow it was missed.

<P>52. Despite the significant monies in the account, the Garcias sought funds from Cajubi for the payment of legal fees, home repairs and their living expenses.

<P>53. In his Motion Reasons, Justice Dunphy found the Garcias do have other assets available. He stated:

<P>54. The Garcias submit that they put a down-payment into their home that had nothing to do with this fraud, and so they should be entitled to assert those funds are non-proprietary.</P>
<P>55. Their argument that they should be somehow entitled to have these funds preserved while their whole family (including relatives in Guatemala) have lived off what is unquestionably Cajubi's funds for the past ten years, is absurd.</P>
<P>56. During Mr. Garcia's cross-examination of October 22, 2018, he admitted that at least 96% of his income since 2008/2009 has been derived from Cajubi. He has continually refused to provide any evidence of sources of income other than Cajubi: (emphasis added)
<QUOTE><P><EM>Ms King: suffice to say Cajubi was your 98 percent if not more, client, correct?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Mr. Garcia: Or 95 maybe</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Mr. Milosevic: There are some small ones, Counsel. If we're going to debate whether it's 95 or 98, we'll agree it's 96</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Cross-examination of Mr. Garcia dated October 22, 2018, p. 119&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 57.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. The Garcias submit that they are entitled to the return of the funds they used for a down payment on their house more than a decade ago. All of the Garcias' mortgage payments, living expenses, vacations, RESPs, RRSPs and well over a million dollars in legal expenses were undisputedly paid for with Cajubi's money. It seems inordinately unfair that they can claim the &lsquo;return&rsquo; of their funds while depleting Cajubi's. This submission wrongly assumes that all of the Garcia living expenses should have been paid for with Cajubi's money instead of their own.</P>
<P>58. Assuming that the Garcias had put $150,000 of their own funds into the Falconridge home in 2007, that money was not segregated from Cajubi's funds. A first mortgage was taken out at the same time, and its principal and interest have been paid over the years out of Cajubi's funds. A second mortgage was put on that property in January 2016 for over $200,000, while a line of credit was taken against the property for nearly $300,000 in or around the same date. All of that debt has been paid using Cajubi's funds, which the Garcias spent.</P>
<P>59. There is nothing in the law that gives them any right to separate out their funds while depleting Cajubi's.</P>
<P>60. Any possible equity the Garcias may have had through their initial down payment, has been commingled and depleted by the first and second mortgages, the line of credit, as well as the fact that all mortgage and debt service payments were made with Cajubi's funds.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>61. In <EM>Waxman</EM>, the Court found that the party seeking access to frozen funds had not met the onus based on many refused questions related to potential sources of available funds:
<QUOTE><P><EM>it can be said that in this case Chester and his sons did not meet the onus of establishing on proper evidence that they personally had no other assets available to them.

<P>62. It is respectfully submitted that the Garcias should not have any other acces to Cajubi's funds to pursue their appeal. Mr. Garcia must work. Mr. Garcia refused to work this past year after the trial despite being directed by Justice Dunphy that he must do so and stop living of Cajubi's funds. He was accepted to work with Uber but did not. In his February affidavit he stated:

<P>63. The Court of Appeal in <EM>Handelman</EM> addressed the issue of payment out of frozen funds to a defendant to pursue litigation post-judgment, stating:
<QUOTE><P><EM>There is no principled reason for the appellant to be able to deplete the funds in court which are subject to the judgment and available to judgment creditors. As the motion judge explained, before judgment, or on a motion to set aside default judgment where potential merit is demonstrated, there is a principled basis to allow the defendant to use his own money for the defence of the action</EM>. <BOLD><EM>But once default judgment has been ordered, the findings are the other way on the merits. Without more, the judgment will stand and there is no basis to allow the defendant to deplete the funds that are in court &ldquo;to the credit of the action</EM>.</BOLD> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>B &amp; M Handelman Investments Ltd. v. Curreri</SOC><CITE>[2011] O.J. No. 2243</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>; Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. It is submitted that the Garcias have not pointed to &ldquo;more&rdquo; to show the Judgment cannot stand.</P>
<P>65. It is undisputed that the Garcias have had a full opportunity and Cajubi's money to defend themselves at a 16 day trial. At paragraph 29 of his Motion Reasons, Justice Dunphy noted that over $400,000 was transferred to the Garcias in the weeks before the trial from the funds allegedly held for Morales.</P>
<P>66. The ruling in <EM>Handelman</EM> is clear that, once judgment is granted, all of the assets of the Defendants <EM>prima facie</EM> belong to the plaintiff. The Garcias have the onus of demonstrating that they ought to have access to the funds which, by virtue of the Judgment, belong to Cajubi. They must demonstrate a meritorious appeal.</P>
<P>67. The Garcias raise two possible bases for their appeal: (i) a limitations defence; and (ii) that the judgment did not address the <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> and corporate identification defences.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Garcias Claim that Limitations Defence was not Considered</EM></TI>
<P>68. Justice Dunphy made numerous findings of fact that the Garcias diligently worked to conceal both their involvement in the investments and the true nature of the investments. Justice Dunphy found that: &ldquo;<EM>Until &ldquo;outed&rdquo; in early September 2009, Mr. Garcia's own involvement with each investment was carefully shielded from the view of all but the Insiders within Cajubi and communication with the Insiders was undertaken off-line using private email accounts</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>69. The Garcias submit that Cajubi should have known there was a cause of action once some losses were finally disclosed. Those losses however were not reflective in any way, shape or form of the actual substantial losses and Justice Dunphy made findings that the Garcias involvement was deliberately hidden.
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 31 and 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>70. After Cajubi's Board changed and Cajubi started to notice irregularities, the Garcias told Cajubi they would help them to discover what happened and whether there was a fraud and if so who was involved. Throughout the process (<EM>and continuing through litigation</EM>), the Garcias repeatedly took the position that they were the victim of a fraud by the other defendants.</P>
<P>71. The Garcias never informed Cajubi that there were losses before the investment was even made since the Garcias were diverting the amount wired to their companies (including they claim, to Ron Timcke and Rio Conde).</P>
<P>72. Nowhere in the Garcias' defence do they ever even raise the existence of Ron Timcke or the monies they were supposedly paying him &ldquo;<EM>at Cajubi's request</EM>&rdquo;. It was not until some significant time after the claim was filed and discoveries were well underway that the name Timcke was discovered.</P>
<P>73. The Garcias did not disclose to Cajubi that the investments they presented were different than the actual investments. For example, to reiterate, in Genesis there could be no return until the lands were developed and/or sold, yet Mr. Garcia was producing &ldquo;<EM>Statements of Account</EM>&rdquo; showing <EM>accrued interest</EM> and profits on an inflated opening balance every month.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Ex Turpi Causa and Corporate Identification</EM></TI>
<P>74. The Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Deloitte &amp; Touche v. Livent Inc.</SOC></CASEREF> sets out the corporate identification doctrine. The Supreme Court concluded that:
<QUOTE><P><EM>where, as here, the use of the corporate identification doctrine would undermine the very purpose of establishing a duty of care, it will rarely be in the public interest to apply it. A negligent auditor cannot limit liability for its own negligence by attributing to the corporation the wrongful acts of its employees, such acts being the very conduct that the auditor undertook to uncover. ... the availability of a third party claim against a fraudulent director weighs against the application of the doctrine. In this case, it is not in the public interest to undermine separate legal personality where the wrongdoer could have been properly named as a third party</EM>. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>

<P>75. In his Trial Reasons, Justice Dunphy made numerous findings that the Garcias intentionally misled and defrauded Cajubi:
<QUOTE><P><EM>This law suit raises the question of whether fraud committed with the knowledge of one or more insiders to whom the plaintiff paid kickbacks loses its character of fraud if the complicit insiders are highly-enough ranked in the victim's organization or if the payer claims that he would not have succeeded in obtaining the business without agreeing to make the payments. In my view it does not</EM>...</P>
<P><EM>... &ldquo;up-front fees&rdquo; was never addressed in institutional communications and careful attention was paid to ensure that neither Mr. Garcia's name nor that of Rio Conde was ever referred to in institutional communications</EM>...</P>
<P><EM>...Mrs. Garcia's &ldquo;normal&rdquo; signature used in Canada for banking or her driver's licence is legible and uses her married name &ldquo;Garcia&rdquo;. In dealing with Cajubi, she deployed a variety of titles from the companies she was associated with (or falsely claimed to be associated with) and illegible signature styles without revealing her full name or else used her maiden name alone. On more than one occasion she signed documents with two different signatures in the same communication. Mr. Garcia seldom sent &ldquo;institutional&rdquo; communications but where he did so, he used his matronymic (mother's last name) to the exclusion of his family name</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras. 1, 31, 35.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>76. Contrary to the Garcias' assertion that his defence of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> was not considered, the Trial Reasons dealt with both the business judgment rule and <EM>ex turpi causa</EM> defence (which encompasses the corporate identification defense). Justice Dunphy found:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>Fraud unravels all and the indoor management rule will not stand in the way of the cleansing process. The contrary suggestion is not worthy of consideration</EM>.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 434.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>77. Justice Dunphy also found that the indoor management rule defence is equally inapplicable:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The flaw in this position is that the indoor management rule cannot be relied upon to excuse fraud of the person invoking the rule. The simple fact is that each of the four investments that underlie this claim ...was procured by reason of the secret commissions that the Garcias caused to be paid to or to the direction of the Insiders and the fraudulent misrepresentations made as to the nature of the investments being proposed</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Trial Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 432.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>78. The Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. Royal Group Inc.</SOC></CASEREF> concluded that an appellant cannot rely on other senior managers who were themselves participants of the unlawful conduct to establish condonation.

<P>79. Justice Dunphy made findings of credibility in regard to the evidence given by the Garcias:
<QUOTE><P><EM>I found both witnesses prepared to be dishonest whenever they thought a dishonest answer might advance their cause. Both of these witnesses have demonstrated a willingness to part with the truth only when all other options have been exhausted. I attach</EM> <BOLD><EM>no</EM></BOLD> <EM>credibility to the testimony of either Mr. or Mrs. Garcia except in matters without controversy, where contrary to their interests or where satisfactorily corroborated by other sources</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias's Use Cajubi's Money to Fund their Vexatious Litigation</EM></TI>
<P>80. Justice Wilton-Siegel previously found that the Garcias to be vexatious litigants.</P>
<P>81. Mr. Garcia confirmed that as early as March 2013, he had already spent over $800,000.00 on legal fees.
<P1><BOLD>Cross-examination of Eduardo Garcia dated October 22, 2018, p. 220, Q.730&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 57.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>82. The Garcias have expended significant legal fees after 2013, all of which was Cajubi's funds.</P>
<P>83. The Garcias have already advanced their full defence at a 16 day trial, having the opportunity to call any corroborating witnesses. In fact, Cajubi consented to making witnesses available from Paraguay and Justice Dunphy allowed the Garcias to call any witnesses by Skype and to make any arrangements necessary. Despite claiming that they needed a lengthier trial as they were calling over 30 witnesses, only Mr. and Mrs. Garcia testified, and they did not call a another witness to corroborate their version of the events.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Garcias Expenses Paid With Cajubi's Money After Trial</EM></TI>
<P>84. It is undisputed that the Garcias have already lived off the funds from Cajubi since the investments were made and for numerous years afterwards. Mr. Garcia was repeatedly asked on cross-examination what evidence he had of any source of employment income other than Cajubi. The question was refused. Despite refusing to disclose the sources of income other than Cajubi's funds, the Garcias have both declared significant household income around $100,000 every year from 2011 through to 2017.
<P1><BOLD>Tax Chart of the Garcia Defendants&mdash;Zucchi Affidavit Ex. 58.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>85. Justice Dunphy noted at paragraph 44 in his Motion Reasons that the Garcias <EM>&ldquo;have been given access to a considerable about of money post-judgment (approximately $80,000) to pay legal and living expenses. Such funds ought to be charged to any non-proprietary funds before being charged to the proprietary claims assets.&rdquo;</EM></P>
<P>86. Justice Dunphy found that <EM>&ldquo;Any dollars spent from this point is a dollar that the creditors will almost certainly never see again.&rdquo;</EM>
<P1><BOLD>Motion Reasons, supra, para. 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>87. These payments have further depleted funds Cajubi could otherwise recover.</P>
<P>88. In <CASEREF><SOC>Yan et al v. Xi Chen et al</SOC></CASEREF>, in considering whether frozen funds should be released, Justice Pattillo noted:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Rather than proceeding with the Action to enable resolution of the issues, including the credibility issues, the plaintiffs (who were requesting access to funds for legal fees) have launched a series of actions, both civil and criminal, incurring significant legal fees as a result and necessitating motions similar to the two before me to fund legal fees. Left to their own devices, I see no reason why that circle will not continue, particularly given the substantial amount of money that has been frozen</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>89. In balancing the convenience of the parties and irreparable harm, it is worthy of note that Justice Dunphy found that: <EM>&ldquo;All of these factors lean heavily against exercising any discretion to permit the Garcia Defendants to dig their debt hold any deeper with money over which the responding parties have a strong equitable claim.&rdquo;</EM> He also found: <EM>&ldquo;The Garcias can appeal without counsel. Mr. Milosevic can provide assistance without appearing on the record.&rdquo;</EM>
<P1><BOLD>Motion Reasons, <EM>supra</EM>, paras. 48 and 51.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Amount Claimed is Excessive</EM></TI>
<P>90. The amount claimed by the Garcias for this appeal is excessive and includes past costs that are unrelated to the appeal. The Garcias have failed to provide a detailed breakdown of the use of $150,000 they seek to obtain.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>91. Cajubi respectfully requests that the Court order that:
<P1>i. The Garcias' motion to vary the Non-Dissipation Order of Justice Dunphy to allow them access funds be dismissed;</P1>
<P1>ii. Cajubi be awarded its costs of this motion.</P1></P>
