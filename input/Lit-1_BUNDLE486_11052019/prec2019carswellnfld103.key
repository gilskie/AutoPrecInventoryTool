<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>Amended</UNDER> Notice of Appeal</TI>
<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT the Appellants appeal from the decision of the Honourable Justice David F. Hurley dated the 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of December, 2017 in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador Trial Division (General) bearing court number 2015 04 G 0120.</P>
<P>AND THAT the grounds of the proposed appeal are:</P>
<P>1. The Learned Judge committed a reviewable error by interpreting clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appended as a Schedule to <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of an Agreement Between the Government and International Paper Company of Newfoundland Limited</EM> passed on September 6 [missing text]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as taking away the Appellants' rights to litigate a claim in Court in favour of mandatory arbitration. In doing so, the Learned Judge contravened the modem approach to statutory interpretation, which instructs that the words contained in a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and objects of the Act.</P>
<P>2. Clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement details the arbitration procedure for those scenarios for which arbitration has already been contemplated in the related legislation and agreements (&ldquo;Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties <BOLD><UNDER>where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements...&rdquo;)</UNDER></BOLD>. It does not expand the matters for which arbitration is mandatory. As the Learned Judge correctly concluded at paragraphs 26, 32, 35, 37 and 41, there is no provision in the 1915 legislation or 1923 legislation (or their related agreements) for mandatory arbitration that prohibits the Appellants' action in Court against the Respondent. Therefore the Learned Judge should have concluded that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement does not require that the Appellants' matter be referred to arbitration.</P>
<P>3. The Learned Judge's interpretation of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement defies the plain wording of the clause, which contains no expansion of the circumstances in which arbitration is mandatory.</P>
<P>4. The Learned Judge's reasons contain a significant inconsistency, finding correctly on the one hand that &ldquo;Clause 2(n) makes no reference to mandatory arbitration&rdquo; (para. 44) and then inconsistently concluding that &ldquo;Clause 2(n) mandated that both parties had to resort to arbitration&rdquo; (para. 46). The second conclusion is incorrect and is not supported by the wording of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement, and leads the Learned Judge to commit a reviewable error.</P>
<P>5. The Learned Judge compounded this reviewable error by framing a party's right to commence a civil action as dependent upon a legislative provision conferring this right, rather than simply existing at common law. The Learned Judge characterized the &ldquo;Plaintiffs' right to initiate and maintain their action in Court&rdquo; as being a &ldquo;right granted in Section 14 of the <EM>1915 Act</EM>...&rdquo;. Respectfully, that is a significant mischaracterization of the common law that leads the Learned Judge to dismiss the Appellants' rights without an explicit legislative basis to do so.</P>
<P>6. The Learned Judge's conclusion not to exercise His Lordship's discretion to deny the application for a stay is based upon His Lordship's reviewable error that there is a legislative basis to deny the Appellants' right to maintain an action in Court. The Learned Judge committed further reviewable errors in this regard by failing to address the advantages of civil litigation&mdash;economic and judicial efficiencies, promotion of access to justice&mdash;over arbitration. The Learned Judge also committed a reviewable error by failing to address the fact that arbitration is ill-suited to deal with the complex causation questions that arise in this case and which necessitate judicial consideration of expert evidence.</P>
<P>7. The Learned Judge committed a further reviewable error by failing to require that the Respondent put before the Court sufficient evidence that the Respondent is a successor company of the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited, the signatory to the 1927 Agreement.</P>
<P>8. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P>AND THAT the Appellants will request that the decision appealed from be reversed.</P>
<P><UNDER>DATED AT Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of May, 2018.</UNDER></P>

<P>1. The Appellants commenced a proposed class action against five Defendants on May 22, 2015. Comer Brook Pulp and Paper Limited is one of the Defendants, and for the purposes of this Factum will be referred to as the Respondent to this appeal.
<P1>Statement of Claim issued May 22, 2015 [Appeal Book, Tab 4, Page 26].</P1></P>
<P>2. Before a hearing of the application for certification of the proposed class action, the Respondent brought an application to stay the proposed class action on the basis that the Appellants are, purportedly, obligated by historical legislation to resolve the dispute, <EM>vis-&ag;-vis</EM> the Respondent, through arbitration (the &ldquo;Jurisdiction Application&rdquo;). The Jurisdiction Application was opposed by the Appellants, as well as by the Town of Deer Lake and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<P>4. In allowing the Respondent's Jurisdiction Application, the Learned Judge contravened the modem approach to statutory interpretation, which instructs that the words contained in a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act and the objects of the Act.

<P>5. Respectfully, there is no basis in the statute relied on by the Learned Judge <EM>(An Act for the Confirmation of an Agreement Between the Government and International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited</EM>, Cap. 4, 18 Geo. v. (1927), passed on September 6, 1927 (the &ldquo;<EM>192</EM>7 <EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;)) to override the procedural right of the Appellants to bring a civil action for damages. The Learned Judge's interpretation of the legislation defies the plain wording of the 1927 Agreement (appended to the 1927 Act); specifically, clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement.
<P1><EM>1927 Act</EM> [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 12].</P1></P>
<P>6. The Learned Judge compounded this reversible error in statutory interpretation by framing the right to commence a civil action as being dependent upon legislation positively granting this right, rather than the right existing at common law. The Learned Judge characterized the &ldquo;Plaintiffs' right to initiate and maintain their action in Court&rdquo; as being a &ldquo;right granted in Section 14 of the <EM>1915 Act</EM>...&rdquo;. Respectfully, that is a significant mischaracterization of the common law, a mischaracterization that subsequently informs the Learned Judge's dismissal&mdash;with no legislative basis to do sol&mdash;of the Appellants' rights to commence an action.
<P1>Decision, para. 41 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 20].</P1></P>
<P>7. In addition, it was a reversible error for the Learned Judge to exercise his discretionary power to deny the stay&mdash;which, it is submitted, was not a discretionary decision even available to His Lordship, given there was no legislative basis to compel arbitration in the first place. In so doing, the Learned Judge relied upon irrelevant jurisprudence.</P>
<P>8. For these primary reasons, as more fully described below, and for the additional reasons outlined herein, the Appellants respectfully submit that the Decision should be overturned and the Jurisdiction Application denied.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II: CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Overview of the Class Action</TI>
<P>9. The proposed class action has been commenced by four representative plaintiffs on behalf of a class of property owners within a defined area of the Town of Deer Lake, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</P>
<P>10. The property owners allege flooding of, and water damage to, their properties. The Statement of Claim alleges that the Defendants, including the Respondent, are liable for this damage due to their respective roles in, <EM>inter alia</EM>, creating and overseeing a water control system constructed for the production of hydroelectric power. The water control system includes a reservoir (Grand Lake Reservoir), a series of dams and dykes, and the man-made Humber Canal (collectively, the &ldquo;Water Control System&rdquo;). It is alleged that water seeps from the Water Control System, causing elevated groundwater levels and extensive water damage to properties and grounds, in turn rendering the properties unfit for habitation.</P>
<P>11. Through the vehicle of a proposed class action, the Appellants seek, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Class, <EM>inter alia</EM> damages for interference with their property rights.</P>
<P>12. Nuisance and negligence are alleged against the Respondent. As against the non-Kruger-associated Defendants (that is, the Town of Deer Lake and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador), the Appellants allege negligence.</P>
<P>13. At the time of filing this Factum, no defence to the Statement of Claim has been filed by any Defendant to the proceeding.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Jurisdiction Application and Decision</TI>
<P>14. The first case management meeting was conducted on February 8. 2016. At the case management meeting, the Court scheduled the hearing of an application to determine the sequence of the Jurisdiction Application (the subject of the present appeal) and the application for certification of the proposed class action. The Appellants had argued that the jurisdiction issue ought to be determined at the same time as the hearing of the certification application, to avoid the delay of inserting an additional hearing (and potential appeal therefrom) prior to the first major procedural step of certification.</P>
<P>15. This separate application to determine the sequence of the Jurisdiction Application and certification application was heard on March 10, 2016 (the &ldquo;Timing Application&rdquo;). A decision in the Timing Application was rendered by the Honourable Justice Hurley on June 17, 2016. His Lordship ordered the Jurisdiction Application to be heard in advance of the certification application.</P>
<P>16. The Jurisdiction Application was heard by the Learned Judge on December 7, 2016. It was opposed by the Appellants, the Town of Deer Lake and the Province. Kruger Inc. and Deer Lake Power Company did not participate.</P>
<P>17. By the Decision dated December 15, 2017. the Learned Judge allowed the application by the Respondent to stay the proceeding against it in the Court. The Learned Judge concluded that the parties opposing the Jurisdiction Application&mdash;the Appellants, the Province and the Town&mdash;had not established that the Court &ldquo;should not follow the legislation which provides that the questions, disputes or differences between the Plaintiffs and Comer Brook Pulp &amp; Paper Limited be referred to arbitration.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, para. 61 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 25].</P1></P>
<P>18. The Appellants disagree with the Learned Judge's conclusion that the legislation provides that questions, disputes or differences between the Plaintiffs and the Respondent must be referred to arbitration. The Learned Judge based his conclusion specifically on a clause in an agreement appended to the 1927 Act.
<P1><EM>1927 Act</EM> [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 12].</P1></P>
<P>19. The Learned Judge reviewed various provisions in three historical statutes starting in 1915 and ending in 1927:
<P1>i. <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited</EM>, Cap. 4, 6 Geo. v. (1915) (the &ldquo;1915 Act&rdquo;). The 1915 Act approved and confirmed an attached indenture agreement entered into between the Government and the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited (the &ldquo;1915 Agreement&rdquo;).
<P2>Appellants' Authorities, Tab 10.</P2></P1>
<P1>ii. <EM>An Act Further to Amend the Act 6 George V. (1915), Chapter Four, Entitled &ldquo;An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited</EM>&rdquo;, Cap. 1, 14 Geo. v. (1923) (the &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo;). The 1923 Act amends various sections of the 1915 Act, and sets out the terms of the financial arrangement between the parties. It attaches, and approves and confirms, two agreements, constituting Part I and Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act (the &ldquo;1923 Agreements&rdquo;). These agreements are themselves to further amend the 1915 Agreement and the 1915 Act.
<P2>Appellants' Authorities, Tab 11.</P2></P1>
<P1>iii. <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of an Agreement Between the Government and International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited</EM>, Cap. 4, 18 Geo. v. (1927). The title of the 1927 Act itself explains its object: to confirm an agreement entered into between the two signatory parties on August 2, 1927 (the &ldquo;1927 Agreement&rdquo;, appended as a schedule to the 1927 Act).
<P2>Appellant's Authorities, Tab 12.</P2></P1></P>
<P>20. The Respondent was unable to identify any recent legislation or agreements purporting to refer to mandatory arbitration claims of the nature asserted by the Appellants. Instead, it relied on this historical legislation. There was no evidence to support any claims having ever been submitted to an arbitration process such as that outlined in the legislation.
<P1>Transcript of the Hearing of the Jurisdiction Application (&ldquo;Transcript&rdquo;), pg. 11, lines 1&ndash;10 [Appeal Book, Tab 7, Page 56].</P1></P>
<P>21. The Learned Judge commenced his review of the legislation with the 1915 Act. The Learned Judge concluded that arbitration of disputes was <EM>not</EM> mandated by that particular Act. At paragraph 10 of the Decision, the Learned Judge concluded that &ldquo;a review of the legislation supports the position that Claimants under the legislation at that point in time maintained the right to pursue their claim in Court without being restricted to arbitration.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, paras. 10, 26 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Pages 13 and 16].</P1></P>
<P>22. The Learned Judge subsequently reviewed the 1923 and 1927 legislation.</P>
<P>23. With respect to the 1923 legislation, the Learned Judge agreed with the Appellants that neither the 1923 Agreement nor Part I of the Schedule to the 1923 Act contained any relevant provisions requiring reference of the claims to arbitration.
<P1>Decision, para. 34 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 18].</P1></P>
<P>24. With respect to Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act, the Learned Judge also accepted the Appellants' position that Clause 8 did not alter the right of a claimant to initiate or pursue a claim in Court.
<P1>Decision, para. 37 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 19].</P1></P>
<P>25. The Learned Judge's decision to grant the stay was based on one provision: clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement. This was also the provision primarily relied on by the Respondent (though it had argued that the preceding provisions also compelled arbitration).
<P1>Decision, para. 40 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Pages 19 and 20].</P1></P>
<P>26. Clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement provides the following:
<QUOTE><P>Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company: but the following provision shall apply to the Company:
<QUOTE><P>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties <BOLD><UNDER>where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements</UNDER>,</BOLD> arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. One arbitrator shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two so appointed. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within twenty days after request in writing from the other party, or if the two arbitrators do not appoint the third within twenty days of the appointment of the second of such two, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may upon application by either party appoint such arbitrator orarbitrators. The award of the arbitrators or any two of them shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto, unless appeal therefrom shall be made to the Supreme Court and notice of such appeal shall be filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of such award. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. The wording of clause 2(n) of the 1927Agreement does not require arbitration of the Appellants' claims, for the reasons that will be outlined in this Factum.</P>
<P>28. Further, the Learned Judge respectfully demonstrates an error in his preliminary comments on the effect of clause 2(n). The Learned Judge states at paragraph 41 of the Decision:
<QUOTE><P>The parties generally conceded that the Plaintiffs' right to initiate and maintain their action in Court depended upon the proper interpretation of that Clause. <BOLD><UNDER>As well it was generally accepted that the 1915 legislation gave claimants this right.</UNDER></BOLD> Contrary to the argument put forth by the Company [Respondent], I found that this right granted in Section 14 of the 1915 Act was not changed by legislation passed in 1923.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the 1927 legislation removed the rights of the claimants such as the Plaintiffs to pursue their claim in Court as originally provided in Section 14 of the 1915 Act. [...] [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. These preliminary comments contain an incorrect premise that a claimant (such as the Plaintiffs) must by legislation be &ldquo;given a right&rdquo; to initiate an action in Court. In this particular case he states that Section 14 of the 1915 Act gives the claimants the right to litigate in Court:
<QUOTE><P>As well, it was generally accepted that the 1915 legislation <UNDER>gave claimants this right</UNDER> [to initiate and maintain their action in Court].</P>
<P>[underline added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 41 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 20].</P1></P>
<P>30. This is incorrect. The Appellants, like all litigants, have a right to initiate an action in court&mdash;whether by way of a proposed class action or otherwise&mdash;that is not predicated on, or dependent upon, any legislative grant of such a right.</P>
<P>31. Absent <UNDER>express</UNDER> language to the contrary, in legislation or in a binding agreement between the relevant parties, the Appellants have a right to initiate an action in Court.</P>
<P>32. The Learned Judge's faulty reasoning&mdash;that there is no right to initiate and maintain an action in Court except if legislation <EM>grants</EM> such a right&mdash;sets the stage for a subsequent interpretation of the legislation that fails to identify express language excluding that right.</P>
<P>33. Having framed the right to initiate an action in Court as being dependent upon a positive granting of such right in Section 14 of the 1915 Act, the Learned Judge subsequently says that &ldquo;While Clause 2(n) does not explicitly refer to Section 14 of the 1915 Act, the matters set out in that clause [clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement] effectively take away the right to litigate a claim in Court in favour of mandatory arbitration.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, para. 42 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 20].</P1></P>
<P>34. The conclusion that the common law right to start an action has &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; been taken away is, with respect, unsupported by the legislation, and is not the correct test in assessing whether the right to litigate has been ousted by legislation. There is no rigour to the Learned Judge's interpretation. &ldquo;Effectively&rdquo; taking away a right is, with respect, not the proper legal test.</P>
<P>35. As stated by Mr. Wagner, Q.C., counsel for the Appellants, at the hearing of the Jurisdiction Application:
<QUOTE><P>Previous legislation does not automatically become obsolete unless specifically stated in the subsequent legislation. That is a reversal of the way of legislative amendments. The older provisions remain in effect except where they're amended.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Transcript, p. 79. lines 5&ndash;10 [Appeal Book, Tab 7, Page 62].</P1></P>
<P>36. Nothing in the legislation amends, changes or revokes the Appellants' rights to initiate an action, which are in fact <UNDER>expressly preserved</UNDER> by Section 14 of the 1915 Act. as the Learned Judge acknowledged.</P>
<P>37. Critical to the intended meaning of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement is the following wording: &ldquo;...where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 of any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements [...].&rdquo; This portion of the clause cannot be ignored or taken out of context. It provides the parameters of clause 2(n). The clause is modifying the arbitration <EM>procedure</EM> to be followed in instances <EM>where provision for arbitration is made</EM>. The Learned Judge fails to ascribe plain and ordinary meaning to the language of clause 2(n). He elides the language of clause 2(n) with the following statement: &ldquo;The various clauses and provisions relating to claims and in particular Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement contain an optional provision for arbitration which can be chosen by the claimants. The fact that a claimant could opt to initiate a claim in Court does not mean that there was no provision for arbitration.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, paras. 44, 45 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>38. In this statement, the Learned Judge has equated an <EM>option</EM> for arbitration with a <EM>mandatory</EM> arbitration process. He has imposed mandatory arbitration on the Plaintiffs' claims without the legislative basis to do so.</P>
<P>39. The Learned Judge makes no mention of a need for <EM>explicit</EM> language removing the right to initiate civil action. Indeed the Learned Judge does not apply this necessary, rigorous requirement to his assessment. The Decision contains no reconciliation of his decision to grant the stay with the language of clause 2(n), and to the need to have explicit language overriding the right to initiate an action in court. Further, the Learned Judge contradicts himself in concluding on the one hand:
<QUOTE><P>[...] Clause 2(n) makes <UNDER>no reference</UNDER> to mandatory arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 44 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>And on the other:
<QUOTE><P>Section 14 gave the option of arbitration or Court to a claimant, while Clause 2(n) <UNDER>mandated</UNDER> that both parties had to resort to arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 46 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>40. The latter statement is entirely unsupported by the Learned Judge's preceding assessment, has no basis in the legislation, and contradicts his correct interpretation two paragraphs earlier that clause 2(n) makes no reference to mandatory arbitration. Again, clause 2(n) simply modifies the arbitration procedure to be followed <EM>when</EM> arbitration is being conducted. It is not in itself sufficient, or intended, to compel arbitration.</P>
<P>41. Subsequently the Learned Judge, having concluded at paragraph 48 that &ldquo;there has been finding for mandatory arbitration&rdquo;, considered whether he ought to exercise discretion to nevertheless deny the stay of proceedings against the Respondent.</P>
<P>42. The Learned Judge's ensuing analysis of his discretionary power is fundamentally flawed, because it is predicated on his conclusion that arbitration is mandated by the legislation. For the reasons outlined above and further detailed Part IV of this Factum, that conclusion is unsupported by the legislation.</P>
<P>43. In addition to that fundamental error, the Learned Judge reviews jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada which, he concludes, &ldquo;has consistently held in a number of recent decisions that the presence of a mandatory arbitration clause precludes the Courts from having jurisdiction to determine the matter.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, para. 52 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 22].</P1></P>
<P>44. The Learned Judge's analysis of his discretionary power is premised on his equivalence of the present matter with jurisprudence in which legislation or a contract, as the case may be, clearly mandated arbitration in the circumstances at hand. That was the context for those cases, setting up the question about whether, despite the clearly mandated arbitration, there was a reason not to apply the legislation or commercial contract agreed to by the parties. At play in the jurisprudence relied upon by the Learned Judge are established policy reasons to uphold the autonomy of parties, preserve commercial certainty, and respect labour relations principles. The findings in these cases cannot be applied to the present case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Notice of Appeal</TI>
<P>45. In the Notice of Appeal, the following grounds of appeal are set out. As outlined in Part III (List of the Issues), these will be combined for purposes of this Factum into two main issues.
<P1>1. The Learned Judge committed a reviewable error by interpreting clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement as taking away the Appellants' rights to litigate a claim in Court in favour of mandatory arbitration. In doing so. the Learned Judge contravened the modem approach to statutory interpretation, which instructs that the words contained in a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and objects of the Act.</P1>
<P1>2. Clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement details the arbitration procedure for those scenarios for which arbitration has already been contemplated in the related legislation and agreements (&ldquo;Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties <BOLD><UNDER>where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements...&rdquo;)</UNDER></BOLD>. It does not expand the matters for which arbitration is mandatory. As the Learned Judge correctly concluded at paragraphs 26, 32, 35, 37 and 41, there is no provision in the 1915 legislation or 1923 legislation (or their related agreements) for mandatory arbitration that prohibits the Appellants' action in Court against the Respondent. Therefore the Learned Judge should have concluded that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement does not require that the Appellants' matter be referred to arbitration.</P1>
<P1>3. The Learned Judge's interpretation of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement defies the plain wording of the clause, which contains no expansion of the circumstances in which arbitration is mandatory.</P1>
<P1>4. The Learned Judge's reasons contain a significant inconsistency, finding correctly on the one hand that &ldquo;Clause 2(n) makes no reference to mandatory arbitration&rdquo; (para. 44) and then inconsistently concluding that &ldquo;Clause 2(n) mandated that both parties had to resort to arbitration&rdquo; (para. 46). The second conclusion is incorrect and is not supported by the wording of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement, and leads the Learned Judge to commit a reviewable error.</P1>
<P1>5. The Learned Judge compounded this reviewable error by framing a party's right to commence a civil action as dependent upon a legislative provision conferring this right, rather than simply existing at common law. The Learned Judge characterized the &ldquo;Plaintiffs' right to initiate and maintain their action in Court&rdquo; as being a &ldquo;right granted in Section 14 of the <EM>1915 Act</EM>...&rdquo;. Respectfully, that is a significant mischaracterization of the common law that leads the Learned Judge to dismiss the Appellants' rights without an explicit legislative basis to do so.</P1>
<P1>6. The Learned Judge's conclusion not to exercise His Lordship's discretion to deny the application for a stay is based upon His Lordship's reviewable error that there is a legislative basis to deny the Appellants' right to maintain an action in Court. The Learned Judge committed further reviewable errors in this regard by failing to address the advantages of civil litigation&mdash;economic and judicial efficiencies, promotion of access to justice&mdash;over arbitration. The Learned Judge also committed a reviewable error by failing to address the fact that arbitration is ill-suited to deal with the complex causation questions that arise in this case and which necessitate judicial consideration of expert evidence.</P1>
<P1>7. The Learned Judge committed a further reviewable error by failing to require that the Respondent put before the Court sufficient evidence that the Respondent is a successor company of the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited, the signatory to the 1927 Agreement.
<P2>Amended Notice of Appeal issued May 2, 2018 [Appeal Book, Tab 2, Page 4].</P2></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III: LIST OF THE ISSUES</TI>
<P>46. There are two main issues:
<P1>a) Did the Learned Judge commit reversible errors in failing to apply the proper principles of statutory interpretation, and in so doing, concluding that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement compelled arbitration of the Appellants' claims?</P1>
<P1>b) Did the Learned Judge commit a reversible error by declining to exercise discretion to dismiss the Jurisdiction Application?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV: ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>47. The first issue on appeal asks whether arbitration was compelled by the legislation relied on by the Respondent. It is an issue of pure statutory interpretation.</P>
<P>48. Statutory interpretation may generally be viewed as a question of mixed fact and law, as the modem approach to statutory interpretation dictates a contextual approach to interpretation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Midnight Marine Ltd. v. Oppenheim</SOC><CITE>2010 NLCA 64</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>302 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 85</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>NLCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> paras. 33 to 37 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 5].</P1></P>
<P>49. However, the appropriate standard of review does not automatically become one of palpable and overriding error (as applies to questions of mixed fact and law) in every case involving interpretation of a statute. As noted by the Court in <EM>Midnight Marine</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, if a decision-maker omits to consider a relevant factor such as the precise wording of a text, the decision-maker in effect applies the wrong law, and this amounts to an error of law, reviewable on the more exacting correctness standard.</P>
<P>50. The present case is one of pure statutory interpretation. There were no findings of fact made by the Learned Judge and there was not a factual record providing context for interpretation of the legislation; rather the legislation itself was the only material considered.
<P1><EM>Midnight Marine</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, para. 44 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 5].</P1></P>
<P>51. At the hearing of the Jurisdiction Application, the Learned Judge asked counsel for the parties whether his task was to determine a question of law. There was consensus that yes, it was.
<P1>Transcript, p. 38 at lines 3&ndash;25; p. 39 at lines 1&ndash;16; p. 113 at lines 23- 25: p. 114 at lines 1&ndash;20 [Appeal Book, Tab 7, Pages 60 and 63].</P1></P>
<P>52. The governing standard of review for questions of law is set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC></CASEREF> at paragraph 8:
<QUOTE><P>On a pure question of law, the basic rule with respect to the review of a trial judge's findings is that an appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the trial judge with its own. Thus the standard of review on a question of law is that of correctness [citation omitted].</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, para. 8 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 2].</P1></P>
<P>53. The applicable standard of review for issue one is correctness.</P>
<P>54. The second issue concerns an exercise of discretion. The Appellants maintain that it was not open to the Learned Judge to consider the question of discretion (as arbitration was not mandated by the legislation), and it was an error in law to do so. reviewable on a standard of correctness. Had the question of discretion been properly before the Learned Judge, however, the applicable standard of review would reflect a degree of deference and be one of palpable and overriding error, unless the error amounted to an error of law, which would be subject to a standard of correctness.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Modern Approach to Statutory Interpretation</TI>
<P>55. The Jurisdiction Application boiled down to a question of statutory interpretation; specifically, how to properly interpret the legislation relied upon by the Respondent. The purported arbitration clauses are contained in historical statutes that, largely, serve to confirm agreements concluded between the years of 1915 and 1927 by the Government of Newfoundland (as it was then known) and various companies. If the Applicant (Respondent) was to succeed in its Jurisdiction Application, the Court had to be satisfied that this historical legislation, properly interpreted, ousts the Appellants' procedural rights to seek to resolve the dispute against the Respondent by way of a proposed class action.</P>
<P>56. The modem approach to statutory interpretation instructs that the words contained in a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act and the objects of the Act.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</SOC><CITE>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 7].</P1></P>
<P>57. The modem approach to statutory interpretation is consistent with section 16 of the <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. I-19 (the &ldquo;Interpretation Act&rdquo;), which mandates an interpretive approach as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>16.</N><TI>Rule of construction</TI><SECP>Every Act and every regulation and every provision of an Act or regulation shall be considered remedial and shall receive the liberal construction and interpretation that best ensures the attainment of the objects of the Act, regulation, or provision according to its true meaning.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>

Newfoundland and Labrador (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</SOC><CITE>2011 NLCA 69</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>314 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 305</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras. 25-26 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 6]</P1></P>
<P>58. In <CASEREF><SOC>Archean Resources Ltd v. Newfoundland (Minister of Finance)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal provided guidance for determining the &ldquo;true meaning&rdquo; of legislation. Green J.A., as he then was, explained the following:
<QUOTE><P>[22] Instead of mandating some fictionalized search for a collective &ldquo;legislative intention&rdquo;, s. 16 directs the court to consider every provision &ldquo;remedial&rdquo; and to interpret it so that it &ldquo;best&rdquo; ensures the attainment of its &ldquo;objects&rdquo; according to its &ldquo;true&rdquo; meaning. This requires a consideration, as an integral part of the interpretive exercise, of the problem or &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; to which the legislature directed its legislative act as a remedy and then the drawing of an inference, based on the language of the whole enactment and the court's general knowledge of the state of the pre-existing law and any information as to the broad social context in which the legislative act occurred, as to what, broadly speaking, the object or objects of the legislative act must have been. The end result is to arrive at a &ldquo;true&rdquo; meaning. That inevitably requires an examination of more than the bare words of the legislative enactment that is in issue, no matter how clear or unambiguous they may at first blush appear. The surrounding text, the interrelation of other related statutes, the social and legislative context in which the provision was enacted, and other extrinsic aids are all sources to be consulted in this exercise. Obviously, if the bare words of the relevant provision appear to be straightforward and seem on their face to admit of only one meaning, they may end up controlling the result, but even in such a case, it is not sufficient to stop the interpretive exercise at this &ldquo;plain&rdquo; meaning; s. 16 requires that at the very least this plain meaning be given a &ldquo;reality check&rdquo; by being tested against other relevant sources of meaning to ensure that there is not some nuance or variation in the normal or apparent meaning that might indicate a different meaning in the particular context under consideration. &ldquo;True&rdquo; meaning is not plain meaning; it is a conclusion arrived at by reconciling all the appropriate indicators of meaning that the court is directed to consider.</P>
<P>[23] In truth therefore, s. 16 enunciates a principle of harmonization in which the courts are directed, in cases of dispute, to adopt and apply an interpretation that fairly reconciles the language used in the enactment with the broader objects of the legislation so as to achieve the general goal, or to rectify the mischief, to which the legislative act appears to have been directed. That exercise determines the general ambit of impact of the legislative act and provides the basis for the court to conclude whether the particular fact situation before it should fall inside or outside that ambit.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>ISSUE ONE</TI>
<P><P1><EM>Did the Learned Judge commit reversible errors in failing to apply the proper principles of statutory interpretation, and in so doing, concluding that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement compelled arbitration of the Appellants' claims?</EM></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>Absent express language to the contrary, the right to commence an action in Court is not removed</TI>
<P>59. It is trite law that absent express language to the contrary, in legislation or in a binding agreement, a claimant has the right to initiate a claim in court.</P>
<P>60. The Learned Judge's conclusion that the common law right to start an action has &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; been taken away is, with respect, unsupported by the legislation, and is not the correct test in assessing whether the right to litigate has been removed by legislation. &ldquo;Effectively&rdquo; taking away a right is not the correct legal test to apply.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>Language of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement does not support Learned Judge's interpretation</TI>
<P>61. As detailed above, the clause primarily relied upon by the Respondent, and relied upon by the Learned Judge in reaching his conclusion to grant the stay, is contained in clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement appended to the 1927 Act.
<P1>Appellants' Authorities, Tab 12.</P1></P>
<P>62. It should be noted that the entire Jurisdiction Application brought by the Respondent was premised on the unestablished fact of the Respondent &ldquo;stepping into the shoes&rdquo; of, and assuming the rights and obligations of, the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited (the &ldquo;Second Company&rdquo;), the signatory to this 1927 Agreement. There was no evidence put before the Learned Judge that the Respondent is the successor company of the Second Company, although this is implied by the Respondent's position and was not challenged by the Learned Judge. In the Appellants' respectful view, this is not an insignificant factual question.</P>
<P>63. The title of the 1927 Act itself explains its object: to confirm an agreement entered into between the two signatory parties on August 2, 1927 (the &ldquo;1927 Agreement&rdquo;, appended as a schedule to the 1927 Act). Section 1 of the 1927 Act underscores this object, providing that the 1927 Agreement is &ldquo;approved, confirmed and adopted&rdquo; and shall &ldquo;have the force and effect of law&rdquo;.</P>
<P>64. The object of the 1927 Agreement is also confirmed by its recitals, which explain that the Second Company is to acquire the property and assets of Newfoundland Power and Paper Company, Limited (the &ldquo;First Company&rdquo;), and as such it essentially steps into the shoes of the First Company with respect to several agreements between the Government and the First Company, whereby the First Company was granted certain rights, powers and privileges in exchange for certain obligations. The 1927 Agreement provides that the Government continues to act as guarantor of instruments of the Second Company and is entitled to certain taxes and import duties paid by the Second Company.</P>
<P>65. The 1927 Act also serves to confirm and amend older agreements, all of which together relate to the same topic&mdash;arrangements between the Government and related companies. As directed by the Court of Appeal in <EM>Arche an</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, the object of these interrelated statutes (to which the older agreements are annexed) will be considered as context.</P>
<P>66. The first of these interrelated statutes was passed on June 5, 1915. This is <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited</EM> (the &ldquo;1915 Act&rdquo;). Like the 1927 Act, it approved and confirmed an attached indenture agreement entered into between the Government and the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited (the &ldquo;1915 Agreement&rdquo;). The recitals of the 1915 Agreement provide, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited has been incorporated &ldquo;for the purpose chiefly of developing certain waters for the manufacture of fertilizers and such other articles and substances in connection with the Company's business&rdquo;.
<P1>1915 Act [Appellants' Authorities. Tab 10].</P1>
<P1>Recitals. 1915 Agreement [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 10].</P1></P>
<P>67. The 1915 Agreement further provides that in connection therewith the Government has demised to it &ldquo;the water power or powers in and upon the Humber River, and in and upon Junction Brook&rdquo; and associated rights and privileges.
<P1>Clause 1, 1915 Agreement [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 10].</P1></P>
<P>68. On July 13, 1923, <EM>An Act Further to Amend the Act 6 George V. (1915), Chapter Four, Entitled &ldquo;An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited&rdquo;</EM> (the &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo;) was enacted. As its recitals set out, the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited had changed its name to the Newfoundland Power and Paper Company. Limited. The 1923 Act takes account of the company's expansion of its operations to include the generation and/or supply of &ldquo;hydraulic and/or electric or other power electric light and heat&rdquo; along with other industries. The 1923 Act amends various sections of the 1915 Act, and sets out the terms of the financial arrangement between the parties. It attaches, and approves and confirms, two agreements, constituting Part I and Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act. These agreements are themselves to further amend the 1915 Agreement and the 1915 Act.
<P1>Section 2, 1923 Act [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 11].</P1>
<P1>Section 14, 1923 Act [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 11].</P1></P>
<P>69. Part I of the Schedule to the 1923 Act is an agreement between three parties: Newfoundland Power and Paper Company Limited, Sir W.G. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Company, Limited (an English company), and the Government of Newfoundland. Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act is an agreement between the Government of Newfoundland and Newfoundland Power and Paper Company, Limited. Its recitals provide:
<QUOTE><P>WHEREAS, the Government granted and conveyed to The Reid Newfoundland Company certain lands mentioned in the Schedule hereto and subsequently such lands and the timber rights thereon, in addition to all rights to water power, were conveyed and demised to the Company</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>70. Clause 2 of Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act confirms the conveyance and demise of these lands and rights to Newfoundland Power and Paper Company, Limited. The Schedule to Part II identifies the lands in question, as well as the following:
<QUOTE><P>All the water powers in and upon the Humber River, and in and upon Junction Brook, a portion of which water powers passed to The Reid Newfoundland Company by virtue of the said grants, and which portion has since been conveyed to the Company, and the remainder of which water powers was demised to the Company by the Agreement of 1915.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Clause 2 of the Schedule to Part II of the 1923 Agreement, pp. 34 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 11].</P1></P>
<P>71. The above overview of the three acts in question and their associated agreements demonstrates that the general goal to which they were directed was to give effect to. and amend, agreements governing the regulatory and financial relationships between the Government of Newfoundland and the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited (or predecessor companies), which conducted various operations at the given times.</P>
<P>72. Turning to the clause on which the Learned Judge bases the Decision&mdash;clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement&mdash;it is clear that it does not impose any mandatory arbitration on third parties. It does not <UNDER>create</UNDER> any arbitration obligations. Rather, it modifies the arbitration <UNDER>procedure</UNDER> originally set out in clause 8 of the 1923 legislation. Clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement is as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company; but the following provision shall apply to the Company:
<QUOTE><P>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties <BOLD><UNDER>where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements,</UNDER></BOLD> arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. (...) [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. The purported arbitration clause does not itself create or expand any arbitration requirement for third parties. The words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense: it provides direction as to the arbitration process to be followed <UNDER>when arbitration is triggered by a separate clause</UNDER>, whether under the 1927 Agreement, the 1915 Act or Agreement or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements (i.e. the 1923 Act or Agreement). That is the only reasonable interpretation of the clause. It does not compel arbitration.</P>
<P>74. The Respondent bore the burden, in the application below, of establishing that there was arbitration <UNDER>compelled</UNDER> by the legislation.</P>
<P>75. As the Learned Judge correctly concluded, there was no such provision in the 1915 and 1923 legislation and agreement. However, the Learned Judge concluded that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; compels arbitration:
<QUOTE><P>While Clause 2(n) does not explicitly refer to Section 14 of the 1915 Act, the matters set out in that clause effectively take away the right to litigate a claim in Court in favour of mandatory arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 42 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 20].</P1></P>
<P>76. Absent <UNDER>express</UNDER> language to the contrary, in legislation or in a binding agreement, the Appellants have the right to initiate an action in Court. The Learned Judge's reasoning&mdash;that there is not a right to initiate and maintain an action in Court except if legislation <EM>grants</EM> such a right&mdash;sets the stage for a subsequent interpretation of the legislation that is incorrect.</P>
<P>77. The conclusion that the common law right to start an action has &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; been taken away is unsupported by the legislation, and is not the correct test in assessing whether the right to litigate has been removed by legislation.</P>
<P>78. The Learned Judge failed to reconcile his conclusion&mdash;that arbitration was compelled&mdash;with the wording of the statute.</P>
<P>79. To contend with the following language of clause 2(n), which is clearly problematic for the Learned Judge's conclusion&mdash;&ldquo;(...) where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements,&rdquo;&mdash;he makes the following comment purporting to reconcile his conclusion with this language:
<QUOTE><P>The various clauses and provisions relating to claims and in particular Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement contain an optional provision for arbitration which can be chosen by the claimants. The fact that a claimant could opt to initiate a claim in Court does not mean that there was no provision for arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, paras. 44. 45 [Appeal Book, Tab 3. Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>80. Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>If the Company, in or by reason of the exercise of any of the rights hereby granted, submerge, destroy, damage or injuriously affect any private rights, interests, lands or properly, and shall be unable to agree with the owner thereof as to compensation to be paid therefor, the Company, with the consent of the Governor in Council, may proceed with the exercise of the said rights, by these presents granted to the said Company, and the compensation to be paid by the Company to the owner, for or in respect to such rights, interests, lands or property, shall be settled by arbitration in the manner hereinbefore provided.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>81. However, section 14 of the 1915 Act provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Nothing herein or in the Schedule hereto in relation to the settlement of claims by arbitration shall be held or construed to prejudice or exclude the right of any claimant to institute an action in a Court of competent jurisdiction in respect to any such claim.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>82. The express reservation of the right to institute a court action by section 14 of the 1915 Act is clear and unambiguous. Section 14 expressly reserves the right of a claimant to commence a court action. Section 14 of the 1915 Act is not extinguished by any of the subsequent amending agreements. The Respondent had tried to argue that because Section 14 was &ldquo;not repeated in any other act&rdquo;, this somehow meant it was no longer in force. That is, of course, contrary to the rules of statutory interpretation. It is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that a subsequent general enactment is presumed not to interfere with a prior specific enactment, absent an intention clearly manifested to the contrary.

Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[1974] S.C.R. 1349</CITE></CASEREF> [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 3].</P1></P>
<P>83. The Learned Judge accepted the Appellants' position on this point that arbitration under clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement was optional, and he correctly concluded at paragraph 26 that &ldquo;a claimant had the right to pursue a claim in Court and was not restricted to arbitration by virtue of Section 14 of the 1915 Act.&rdquo; In other words, arbitration of what the Learned Judge refers to as nuisance carried out under statutory authority is <EM>optional</EM>.</P>
<P>84. However, the Learned Judge subsequently retreats from this interpretation, and carries on to commit two errors.</P>
<P>85. First, there is no evidence in the present case that the circumstances contemplated by clause 15 apply here; the Respondent has not conceded that an alleged nuisance has been caused by its activities, that the alleged damage is an inevitable result of legislatively authorized undertaking, or that it is liable to the Appellants.</P>
<P>86. Second, and more fundamentally, the Learned Judge relies on optional arbitration in clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement as satisfying the language of &ldquo;provision for arbitration&rdquo; in clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement. Although clause 15 of the 1915 Act is indeed &ldquo;provision for arbitration&rdquo;, he commits a fundamental error by, contrary to the legislation, converting what was <EM>optional</EM> arbitration&mdash;for claims of compensation for public nuisance where liability (including causation) is admitted (not the case here)&mdash;to the status of <EM>mandatory</EM> arbitration. With no support in the language of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement, the Learned Judge interprets clause 2(n) to modify the status of <EM>optional</EM> arbitration to <EM>mandatory</EM> arbitration of the Appellants' claims. This is a reversible error. Clause 2(n) does <UNDER>not</UNDER> say that where arbitration was once optional, it is now mandatory. The Learned Judge errs by interpreting the legislation contrary to its true meaning, and plain wording, and to any possible contextual reading of the legislation, and in so doing imposes mandatory arbitration where there is no such legislative basis.</P>
<P>87. Unless the legislation clearly demands it, arbitration must not be imposed on the Appellants. The approach described in <EM>Archean</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> is directed to &ldquo;giving effect, as fully and faithfully as possible, to the meaning associated with the legislative act and counters the potential for substitution of judicial for legislative will.&rdquo; The Learned Judge commits a reversible error by departing from the approach prescribed by <EM>Archean</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lynch v. St. John's (City</SOC><CITE>2016 NLCA 35</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>380 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 13</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at para. 77 [Appellants' Authorities, Tab 4].</P1></P>
<P>88. The Learned Judge had said that &ldquo;The various clauses and provisions relating to claims and in particular Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement contain an optional provision for arbitration which can be chosen by the claimants.&rdquo; He had analyzed each provision in the 1915 and 1923 legislation and had concluded that there was no imposition by such provision of mandatory arbitration of the Appellants' claims therein. He cannot convert optional arbitration (of matters irrelevant to this claim, in any event) to mandatory arbitration with no legislative basis to do so.</P>
<P>89. The Learned Judge has erred by overlooking the requirement to identify <EM>explicit</EM> language overriding the common law right to initiate civil action. He applies no such rigorous requirement to his interpretation. He does not explain how his decision to grant the stay is consistent with giving reasonable meaning to the language of clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement. Further, the Learned Judge contradicts himself in concluding on the one hand:
<QUOTE><P>[...] Clause 2(n) makes <UNDER>no reference</UNDER> to mandatory arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 44 [Appeal Book, Tab 3. Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>And on the other:
<QUOTE><P>Section 14 gave the option of arbitration or Court to a claimant, while Clause 2(n) <UNDER>mandated</UNDER> that both parties had to resort to arbitration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision, para. 46 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 21].</P1></P>
<P>90. The Learned Judge has made a leap to the second conclusion, contradicting his preceding assessment two paragraphs earlier that clause 2(n) makes no reference to mandatory arbitration, and with no support in the legislation. Again, clause 2(n) simply modifies the arbitration procedure to be followed <EM>when</EM> arbitration occurs. It is not in itself sufficient, or intended, to remove the right to initiate a claim in court.</P>
<P>91. The Learned Judge has implied terms that are not present in the legislation.</P>
<P>92. There is no manifest intention for clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement to have the effect of compelling arbitration of claims under Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement (which, again, is concerned with claims of a different nature than those in the present case).</P>
<P>93. The Respondent filed no supporting evidence of a legislative intention to mandate arbitration. Counsel's submissions included speculation that the Respondent may have been &ldquo;reluctant to allow themselves to be the subject of access to the court&rdquo;, but there was no evidence that the legislature at the time intended to preclude access to the court. Nor was there any evidence to support the Respondent's suggestion that the legislature would have intended to make &ldquo;concessions&rdquo; of this nature (i.e. excluding the right of claimants to access the court) to encourage development by the Respondent. The following submissions made by the Respondents' counsel at the hearing were unsupported by any evidence:
<QUOTE><P>The companies themselves would be reluctant to allow themselves to be the subject of access to the courts that would delay and affect the development of the agreements and the development of the assets and so on and operations pursuant to the agreement, but they recognized that if we have injuriously affected anyone, that their rights are subject to arbitration provisions, which can be done in a summary way and done quickly, not through the laborious, and largely at that time, inaccessible access to the court.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Transcript, pp. 23-24, lines 20&ndash;25; 1&ndash;7 [Appeal Book, Tab 7, Page 58].</P1>
<QUOTE><P>When you read the Act, as a whole, you'll see the various concessions that are made by the government of the day to encourage and to permit this development. This development at the time, if you go through the documents to see the amounts of money involved&mdash;today, you know, 15 million dollars, may not in today's dollars seem like a lot. but back in 1915 and '23 and '27, these were huge, huge amounts of money and a huge commitment of resources on the part of the government, and a huge commitment of funds and liability on the part of the developers. It was not unusual that in coming to that kind of an arrangement that concessions and specific considerations in dealing with matters to facilitate that development are made by the government in favour of the party to whom they have entrusted the development of these resources. One of those is that disputes between what the company is authorized to do in this development and in the operation of the asset that it develops, is that if in doing any of these works it injuriously affects somebody else or causes damage to their property, the rights of that person are not interfered with, they are given the right to assert a claim, but those claims are dealt with in the arbitration process, not in the litigation process, and that was something that was obviously negotiated between the company and the government and the government agreed that this was a reasonable and fair way to go [...]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Transcript, pp. 25-26, lines 12&ndash;25, 1&ndash;21 [Appeal Book, Tab 7, Page 59].</P1></P>
<P>94. Conjecture and speculation by counsel for the Respondent is not equivalent to evidence of legislative intention.</P>
<P>95. The legislation clearly does not mandate arbitration of the Appellants' claim, nor does it admit of ambiguity. However if there <EM>had been</EM> any ambiguity in the legislation suggesting that arbitration of the Appellants' claims <EM>may</EM> be compelled by clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement, such ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the Appellants' rights of access to the court.

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>ISSUE TWO</TI>
<P><P1><EM>Did the Learned Judge commit a reversible error by declining to exercise discretion to dismiss the Jurisdiction Application?</EM></P1></P>
<P>96. Having concluded at paragraph 48 of the Decision that &ldquo;there has been finding for mandatory arbitration&rdquo;, the Learned Judge considered whether he ought nevertheless to exercise discretion to deny the requested stay. The Learned Judge reviews jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada which, he concludes, &ldquo;has consistently held in a number of recent decisions that the presence of a mandatory arbitration clause precludes the Courts from having jurisdiction to determine the matter.&rdquo;
<P1>Decision, para. 52 [Appeal Book, Tab 3, Page 22].</P1></P>
<P>97. The Learned Judge's assessment of the discretion question contains a premise that the present matter is on equal footing with the cases he reviews. In those cases, however, the legislation or contract, as the case may be, mandated arbitration in the circumstances at hand. The scope of the legislation or contract was clear, requiring arbitration. Those cases were decided against a fundamentally different background.</P>
<P>98. This present matter is not one in which a statute specifically requires that the dispute in issue be referred to an arbitration process. Therefore there is no proper foundation from which to weigh, in a discretionary process, the characteristics of arbitration against the procedural vehicle of a class action.</P>
<P>99. Further, the established principles at play in the authorities relied upon by the Learned Judge are irrelevant; they are directed to upholding autonomy of the parties in question, respecting freedom of contract and clear legislative intent. For example the Learned Judge cites, at some length, <CASEREF><SOC>Seidel v. Telus Communications Inc</SOC></CASEREF>. The case is set against a a key principle; if parties freely enter into agreements by which they have agreed to arbitrate the matter in dispute, the parties will be referred to arbitration. The principle of liberal interpretation of arbitration clauses adopted by the parties rests upon the foundation of the mutual intention and agreement of the parties. The principles of freedom of contract and personal autonomy do not come into play in the present circumstances, where there is <UNDER>no contract</UNDER> between the Appellants and the Respondent, no mutual agreement relating to the procedure to be followed to resolve disputes, and thus no deference of autonomy to uphold.</P>
<P>100. The Learned Judge's reasons contain no indication that His Lordship reconciled the distinction between the present matter and the several cases he cites at pages 15 to 18 of the Decision, all of which are distinguishable on the basis that they involve bargaining between parties, a meeting of the minds by parties and upholding commercial certainty. For example, the context is consumer contracts in <EM>Dell, Rogers, Seidel</EM>, and labour relations governed by collective agreements in <EM>Weber</EM> and <EM>Basillion</EM>.</P>
<P>101. As submitted at the hearing, the primary argument being submitted by the Appellants is not that arbitration is <EM>less preferable</EM> to a class action; rather, arbitration is not legislated, and is therefore not compelled. There should be no engagement in a weighing of relative preferabilities by the Learned Judge.

<P>1. This is the Factum of the First_Respondent; Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Limited <BOLD>(&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;),</BOLD> in response to the appeal brought by the Appellants.</P>
<P>2. As a putative class proceeding, leave was required from the Case Management Judge, the Honourable Justice David F. Hurley, for the Company to bring the Interlocutory Application which is the subject of this Appeal.</P>
<P>3. Pursuant to Justice Hurley's June 17, 2016 Case Management Order, the Company brought Application pursuant to the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Stay Application&rdquo;</BOLD>) to stay the proceeding and enforce arbitration obligations per the <EM>International Paper Co., Ltd. Act</EM>, Cap.4, 18 Geo. v. (1927) (the <BOLD>&ldquo;1927 Act&rdquo;</BOLD>) and related legislation and agreements with the force and effect of legislation (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Legislation&rdquo;</BOLD>).
<P1><BOLD>Case Management Order [Appeal Book, Tab 5]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Stay Application [Appeal Book, Tab 6]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>4. The Stay Application was framed on the express basis that the Company's rights and interests in the water control system continue pursuant to the Legislation. The Statement of Claim by which the action is brought asserts operations for &ldquo;nearly a century&rdquo; and identifies the Company amongst the &ldquo;Kruger Defendants&rdquo; which are described with reference to corporate successions tracing back to the International Power and Paper Company of Newfoundland Limited. The Stay Application was grounded on the affidavit of Darren Scott Pelley, Vice President and General Manager of the Company; it was not challenged by cross-examination and was accepted by Justice Hurley. It is disingenuous for the Appellant to now complain that relevant facts were unestablished.
<P1><BOLD>Stay Application [Appeal Book, Tab 6, para.4]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Statement of Claim [Appeal Book, Tab 4, paras. 1 and 12&ndash;16]</BOLD></P1>

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, para. 4]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Appellants' Factum, para. 62]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. The hearing of the Stay Application proceeded before Justice Hurley on December 7, 2016 with submissions by counsel for the Company, counsel for the Appellants, counsel for the Fourth Respondent (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Town&rdquo;)</BOLD> and counsel for the Fifth Respondent (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Province&rdquo;)</BOLD> on the application of the Legislation to the claims advanced in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>6. The Legislation amends and adopts agreements to &ldquo;promote the development of all enterprise in the Colony which will utilize its products and resources and create new industries&rdquo; between the Company and the Province, giving them the force and effect of law. Per the <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, such preamble is intended to assist in explaining the purpose and object of the Legislation.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Newfoundland Products Corporation Act</EM>, Cap.4, 6 Geo.V. (1915) (the &ldquo;1915 Act&rdquo;) [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, s.1 and preamble to Schedule]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, s.1 and cl.2 to Schedule]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c I-19 (the &ldquo;<EM>Interpretation Act</EM>&rdquo;) [Company's Authorities, Tab 8, s.14]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. Interpreted in context, as agreements evolved and were amended by statute and subsequent agreements in 1915, 1923 and 1927, the Legislation clearly dictates that disputes, including any alleged injurious impact upon private rights and interests, being the cause of action asserted by the Appellants in the within proceeding, be resolved by arbitration (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Arbitration Submission&rdquo;).</BOLD>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Interpretation Act</EM> [Company's Authorities, Tab 8, s.16]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl.2 and cl.2.(n) of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. Suggestions that Justice Hurley began from an erroneous premise are unfounded: the conclusion that, in 1915, the applicable legislation &ldquo;gave&rdquo; or &ldquo;created&rdquo; a right to litigate is taken out of context of the analysis which preceded it as to the impact of a term of agreement which compelled arbitration and its legislative approval and confirmation, subject to specific conditions including the declaration that the discretion to either litigate or arbitrate is not prejudiced or excluded. Justice Hurley's reference in considering the scope of the 1927 Act clearly relates to the conclusion that, in 1915, the legislation returned the right which the agreement approved and confirmed by that same legislation had taken away.
<P1><BOLD>[Appellants' Factum, para. 29 <EM>et seq.</EM>]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, paras. 13, 17, 19&ndash;26 and 41]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, s.14 and cl.15 to Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. Since 1927 there has been no discretion as to whether disputes between the Company and Third Parties resulting from the exercise of rights granted by the Legislation should be arbitrated or litigated. The 1927 Act expressly obliges arbitration of disputes &ldquo;... where provision for arbitration is made ... in the Act or Agreement of 1915 ...&rdquo; and it is clear that provision for arbitration was made in the Agreement of 1915 for disputes such as the cause of action asserted by the Appellants in these proceedings.
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl.2.(n) to Schedule]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, cl.15 to Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. Justice Hurley's decision on the Stay Application recognizes and extends deference to the Arbitration Submission in the Legislation after careful analysis, in context, of the interplay between the agreements and statutes enacted in 1915, 1923 and 1927 and thoughtful review of the applicable jurisprudence. Justice Hurley concludes that arbitration jurisdiction should be accepted and affirmed whether provided by legislation or when agreed to by the parties. He further recognizes that arbitration is regarded as an efficient means of dispute resolution, particularly as regards the development of resources for the public good.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, paras. 42&ndash;47, 57 and 60]</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. Over the past century, the Legislation has, from time to time, been amended to reflect the renegotiation of the agreements between the Company and the Province, pursuant to which the Company and its corporate predecessors have operated. For example, Clauses 2 and 11 of the Schedule to the 1927 Act clarify how obligations are modified and how successors to the original signatory to the agreement are also bound:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>2. The Company shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions vested in, or owned or enjoyed by the Old Company under the Act and Agreement of 1915 and the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, and shall be bound by all the obligations Imposed upon the Old Company under said Acts and Agreements, except in so far as such rig hts, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions and such obligations are extended, modified or otherwise affected by the following ...</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>11. In this Agreement wherever the context admits the expression &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; shall be held to include the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited, and the assigns of all or substantially all its property and assets;</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl.2 and cl.11 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Contrary to assertions by the Appellants, Justice Hurley did extend a modern approach to interpretation of the Legislation: analysis of the 1927 Act is predicated on understanding the agreements and legislation which preceded it and are referenced within it:
<P1>(a) The <EM>Newfoundland Products Corporation Act</EM>, (the <BOLD>&ldquo;1915 Act&rdquo;)</BOLD> includes and confirms an agreement entered April 16, 1915 between the corporate predecessor to the Company and the Province; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The <EM>Nfld. Power and Paper Co., Ltd. Act</EM>, (the <BOLD>&ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo;)</BOLD> includes and confirms an agreement entered June 9, 1923 between the corporate predecessor to the Company and the Province.</P1>
<P1>The 1915 and 1923 legislation is interpreted as it was amended in 1927 and effective to date; it is not considered in isolation.
<P2><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, s.1]</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Nfld. Power and Paper Co., Ltd. Act</EM>, Cap.1, 14 Geo.V. (1923) (the &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo;) [Company's Authorities, Tab 12, s.14]</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7]</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>13. The Company's rights and obligations in reference to the water control system, being how the allegations are introduced in the Statement of Claim, are governed by the 1915 Act, the 1923 Act and the 1927 Act, as each has been amended. The 1915 Act and the 1927 Act make provision for a process of arbitration for the resolution of disputes with third parties; the 1923 Act amends and confirms the 1915 Act.
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, cl.15 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1923 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 12, s.14]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, s.1 and cl.2(n) of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. As contrasted to contracts which normally bind only parties thereto, the agreements legislated within the 1915 Act, the 1923 Act and the 1927 Act have been given the force and effect of law, which is of particular significance insofar as they address third party interests. Unless declared to be a private Act by express provision, every Act is considered to be a public Act. To the extent that it may be suggested that there is any doubt as to meaning, public Act are construed it keeping in view that they are taken to have been passed for the public advantage.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Interpretation Act</EM> [Company's Authorities, Tab 8, s.5]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ottawa v. Royal Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>[1964] SCR 526</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>1964 CanLII 13</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Company's Authorities, Tab 3, p.540]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The preference or legislative intent to compel arbitration is clear based on the express wording of the Legislation, both with reference to disputes relating to third party interests, as asserted by the Appellants, and as between parties to agreements incorporated therein. Justice Hurley recognized the various examples of this legislative intent throughout his Reasons for Judgment.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, paras. 11&ndash;18, 34, 40 and 42&ndash;47]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. The currently operative Arbitration Submission resides in the 1927 Act and is as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>2. The Company shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions vested in, or owned or enjoyed by the Old Company under the Act and Agreement of 1915 and the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, and shall be bound by all the obligations Imposed upon the Old Company under said Acts and Agreements, except in so far as such rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions and such obligations are extended, modified or otherwise affected by the following provisions:</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>(n) Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company; but the following provision shall apply to the Company:</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Comp any and third parties where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. One arbitrator shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two so appointed. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within twenty days after request in writing from the other party, or if the two arbitrators do not appoint the third within twenty days of the appointment of the second of such two, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may upon application by either party appoint such arbitrator or arbitrators. The award of the arbitrators or any two of them shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto, unless appeal therefrom shall be made to the Supreme Court and notice of such appeal shall be filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of such award.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl. 2.(n) of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The 1923 Act amended the 1915 Act and the agreement therein, including as stated in section 14:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>14.</N><SECP>THE Agreement of 1915 and the Act of 1915, are hereby further amended by the terms and conditions contained in the Agreements forming Part I and Part II of the Schedule to this Act, which Agreements are hereby approved and confirmed.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1923 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 12, s.14]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Declared in the 1927 Act to no longer apply to the Company, clause 8 of the agreement of 1923 had prescribed mandatory arbitration as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>8. ANY questions, disputes or differences arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the execution thereof shall, on the application of either party, be referred to the award and final determination of two disinterested persons, one to be appointed by each of the parties in difference, and if the arbitrators failed to agree, then to the award, umpirage and final determination of an umpire to be appointed by the arbitrators, and the award of such arbitrators or umpire shall be final and binding on both parties, and any such reference shall be deemed a submission to arbitration within the meaning of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland (third series).</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1923 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 12, cl. 8. of Schedule Part II]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. The provision for arbitration in the agreement within the 1915 Act, as referenced in clause 2 .(n) of the agreement within the 1927 Act, states as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>15. If the Company, in or by reason of the exercise of any of the rights hereby granted, submerge, destroy, damage or injuriously affect any private rights, interest, lands or property, and shall be unable to agree with the owner thereof as to compensation to be paid therefor, the Company, with the consent of the Governor in Council, may proceed with the exercise of the said rights, by these presents granted to the said Company, and the compensation to be paid by the Company to the owner, for or in respect to such rights, interest, lands or property, shall be settled by arbitration in the manner hereinbefore provided.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, cl. 15. of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The 1927 Act expressly confirms that successors to the original party to the agreement contained therein are also bound:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>11. In this Agreement wherever the context admits the expression &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; shall be held to include the International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited, and the assigns of all or substantially all its property and assets;</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl.2 and cl.11 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The mandatory Arbitration Submission and the intention to amend the Legislation, as it existed to that point, is reinforced by clause 5 of the Schedule to the 1927 Legislation:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>5. The Company may, as incidental to the exercise of its rights under Clause 1 of the Agreement of 1915, as affected by the Act of 1915, and under any other grants or demise of water powers which the Company shall acquire, regulate the amount of water flowing in the streams, lakes and watercourses referred to in said Clause 1 or in said other grants or demises in such manner as it may require for its operations; provided that the Company shall pay for such damage as it may cause thereby in accordance with the provisions in that respect of the Act and Agreement of 1915 as affected by the Subsequent Acts and Agreements.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl. 5 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Since 1927 there have been no amendments to the Legislation which alter the Arbitration Submission.</P>
<P>23. The Plaintiffs have not commenced the process for arbitration, even though arbitration is the exclusive remedy available pursuant to the Legislation.</P></BLOCK1>

<P>25. Suggestions are unfounded that Justice Hurley began analysis of the Stay Application from the erroneous premise that the right to litigate disputes existed only by express grant. His conclusion that the applicable legislation in 1915 &ldquo;gave&rdquo; or &ldquo;created&rdquo; a right to litigate is taken out of context of earlier discussion of the impact of the legislation passed June 5, 1915 which &ldquo;... approved and confirmed, subject to ... conditions and exceptions...&rdquo; the agreement dated April 16, 1915 and incorporated in the 1915 Act.

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, paras. 13, 17, 19&ndash;26 and 41]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. The Agreement dated April 16, 1915 between the Company and the Province expressly provided that claims made by third parties for damages alleged to result from the Company's exercise of rights granted under the Agreement: &ldquo;... shall be settled by arbitration in the manner hereinbefore provided.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, cl. 15. of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. The 1915 Act confirms the Agreement dated April 16, 1915 subject to conditions, including the proviso in section 14 that:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>14.</N><SECP>Nothing herein or in the Schedule hereto in relation to the settlement of claims by arbitration shall be held or construed to prejudice or exclude the right of any claim ant to institute in action in a Court of competent jurisdiction in respect to any such claim.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, s.1 and s.14]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. Having already discussed and concluded that in 1915 the Agreement would oblige arbitration but that, by operation of the 1915 Act, the Agreement was modified to reinstate the discretion to arbitrate or to litigate, Justice Hurley's statement that: &ldquo;... the 1915 legislation gave claimants this right [to litigate] ...&rdquo; should not be taken out of context to suggest an erroneous presumption that the right to litigate had to be &ldquo;given&rdquo; and did not otherwise exist in law. To the contrary, the statement clearly means that the right ousted by the Agreement was given back by the statute's modification of the Agreement.

<BLOCK3><N>(b)</N><TI>Does the language in clause 2.(n) accord with the decision to grant the Stay Application?</TI>
<P>29. The Legislation reflects the evolution of various agreements between the Company and the Province, incorporating while modifying and confirming such pre -existing agreements, including confirmation that the agreements have the force and effect of law. While shaped by its predecessors, the 1927 Act governs the issue at hand of the Arbitration Submission.</P>
<P>30. It is disingenuous to suggest that the Legislation might not be relevant to current claims given that the Appellants' claims against the Company are framed in the Statement of Claim in reference to the Company's ongoing operations &ldquo;for nearly a century&rdquo; and identify the Company amongst the &ldquo;Kruger Defendants&rdquo; which are described with reference to corporate successions tracing back to the International Power and Paper Company of Newfoundland Limited. The Stay Application was itself expressly framed on the basis that the Company's rights and interests in the water control system, as it is described in the Statement of Claim, were created by and continue pursuant to the Legislation. The Appellants did not challenge evidence led on behalf of the Company by cross-examination of its deponent, and the evidence was accepted by Justice Hurley.

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment [Appeal Book, Tab 3, paras. 4 - 5 ]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. The 1927 Act expressly states that the agreement dated August 2, 1927, and incorporated therein as a schedule, has &ldquo;... the force and effect of law.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, s.1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. Since 1927, the legislatively-prescribed mechanism to pursue a cause of action such as is asserted by the Appellants is by arbitration:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>2. The Company shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions vested in, or owned or enjoyed by the Old Company under the Act and Agreement of 1915 and the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, and shall be bound by all the obligations Imposed upon the Old Company under said Acts and Agreements, except in so far as such rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions and such obligations are extended, modified or otherwise affected by the following provisions:</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>(n) Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company; but the following provision shall apply to the Company:</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. One arbitrator shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two so appointed. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within twenty days after request in writing from the other party, or if the two arbitrators do not appoint the third within twenty days of the appointment of the second of such two, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may upon application by either party appoint such arbitrator or arbitrators. The award of the arbitrators or any two of them shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto, unless appeal therefrom shall be made to the Supreme Court and notice of such appeal shall be filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of such award.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl. 2.(n) of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. For convenience, the Arbitration Submission operates as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>2.(n)... Any ... disputes ... between the Company and third parties where provision for arbitration is made ... in the Act or Agreement of 1915 ... shall ... be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl. 2.(n) of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Agreement of 1915 is defined in the recitals of the Schedule to the 1927 Act as:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The Agreement dated the 16th day of April, 1915, between His Excellency, the Governor of Newfoundland in Council, of the one part, and the Newfoundland Products Corporation. Limited (the original name of the Old Company), of the other part, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Agreement of 1915&rdquo;;</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, recitals of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. The Agreement of 1915 is incorporated as a schedule to the 1915 Act and includes the following provision for arbitration (as such term is used in clause 2.(n) of the Schedule to the 1927 Act):
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>15. If the Company, in or by reason of the exercise of any of the rights hereby granted, submerge, destroy, damage or injuriously affect any private rights, interests, lands or property, and shall be unable to agree with the owner thereof as to compensation to be paid therefor, the Company, with the consent of the Governor in Council, may proceed with the exercise of the said rights, by these presents granted to the said Company, and the compensation to be paid by the Company to the owner, for or in respect to such rights, interest, lands or property, shall be settled by arbitration in the manner hereinbefore provided.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, cl.15 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. While the Agreement of 1915 was modified by section 14 of the 1915 Act to reinstate the discretion to litigate where the agreement had made arbitration mandatory, clause 2.(n) of the Schedule to the 1927 Act expressly references the &ldquo;...the Act <BOLD><UNDER>or</UNDER></BOLD> Agreement of 1915 ...&rdquo; and, the Agreement of 1915 having been expressly defined without reference to modification by the Act, there is no basis to suggest that discretion to litigate should modify the Arbitration Submission.
<P1><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, s.14]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, recitals and cl.2 of Schedule]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. Justice Hurley's conclusions that clause 2.(n) of the Schedule to the 1927 Act compels arbitration as contemplated by clause 15 of the Agreement of 1915 and reinforced by clause 5 of the Schedule to 1927 Act are plainly sustained by principles of modern interpretation of statute. As set forth in the <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>16.</N><SECP>Every Act and every regulation and every provision of an Act or regulation shall be considered remedial and shall receive the liberal construction and interpretation that best ensures the attainment of the objects of the Act, regulation, or provision according to its true meaning.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Interpretation Act</EM> [Company's Authorities, Tab 8, s.16]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. The decision of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Archean Resources Ltd. v. Newfoundland (Minister of Finance)</SOC></CASEREF> is frequently cited for the direction provided by The Honourable Justice Green in interpreting legislation. For example, it is applied by this Honourable Court in the 2017 decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Penney v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Service NL)</SOC></CASEREF> with reference to the extrapolation of legislative intention through consideration of each provision of the statute as remedial and, with reference to academic authority, the consideration of the immediate and broader context in which the provision in question exists. In that matter, this Court considered statements in the House of Assembly in May of 2000 when the bill that eventually became the statute in question was introduced.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Penney v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Service NL)</SOC><CITE>2017 NLCA 25 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Company's Authorities, Tab 4, paras. 17&ndash;21]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. In the matter at hand, the issue alleged is the interpretation of the Arbitration Submission, a clause in an agreement given the force and effect of law in a public Act. The context in which the Arbitration Clause was created can be determined through the recitals and specific clauses of such agreement, being the schedule to the 1927 Act.
<P1>(a) The Company operated under a series of agreements and statutes created between 1915 and 1925, enumerated and defined collectively as the &ldquo;Subsequent Acts and Agreements&rdquo;;
<P2><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, recitals of Schedule]</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>(b) The Agreement of 1915 in its first recital states its objective to be: &ldquo;... to promote the development of all enterprises in the Colony which utilize its products and resources and create new industries;&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, recitals of Schedule]</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>(c) Through 1915, 1923 and 1927, the agreements and statutes which govern the development of public resources to create industry consistently direct that disputes arising through the Company's operations be resolved by arbitration. Most are not relevant to specific claims of the Appellants but all illustrate the legislative intention to mandate dispute resolution and to bind third parties to the agreements:
<P2>i.) From the 1915 Act:
<P3>(1) Section 13 prescribes the procedure for arbitration;</P3>
<P3>(2) Section 14 reserves discretion to litigate notwithstanding provision to the contrary for resolution of claims by arbitration;</P3>
<P3>(3) Section 19 obliges that disputes in relation to the depreciation of preexisting third-party rights to develop water power be determined by arbitration;</P3>
<P3>(4) Clause 2 obliges arbitration when agreement cannot be reached on the amount payable to the Company by third parties for the Company's works for power;</P3>
<P3>(5) Clause 3 obliges arbitration when agreement cannot be reached for the price for power supplied by the Company to third parties;</P3>
<P3>(6) Clause 10 obliges arbitration for settlement of payment to third-party land owners or occupiers for expropriation of their property;</P3>
<P3>(7) Clause 15 obliges arbitration of third party claims for damages alleged to result from the Company's operations pursuant to the 1915 Act; and</P3>
<P3>(8) Clause 16 obliges arbitration of claims by the Crown for damages al leged to result from the Company's operations pursuant to the 1915 Act;</P3></P2>
<P2>ii.) From the 1923 Act:
<P3>(1) Section 11 directs that the price payable to the Company for the possible sale of hydro-electric power for the Newfoundland Railroad is to be agreed upon, failing which it will be fixed by arbitration; and</P3>
<P3>(2) Clause 8 questions, disputes or differences between parties to the agreement shall be determined by arbitration;</P3></P2>
<P2>iii.) From the 1927 Act:
<P3>(1) Clause 2.(n) mandates arbitration where provision for arbitration is made in the 1927 Act &ldquo;... or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements ...&rdquo;;</P3>
<P3>(2) Clause 5 provides that any damages caused by exercise of its rights to maintain dams and reservoirs for the purpose of its works and operations shall be paid by the Company in accordance with the Act and Agreement of 1915 as affected by the Subsequent Acts and Agreements; and</P3>
<P3>(3) Clause 9.(d) obliges arbitration when no agreement is reached to set compensation where claims that rights of third-party riparian owners are impacted by the Company's exercise of rights to dam and regulate the flow of water.
<P4><BOLD>1915 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 11, ss.13, 14 and 19 and recitals, cl.2, 3, 10, 15 and 16 of Schedule]</BOLD></P4>
<P4><BOLD>1923 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 12, s.11 and cl.8 of Schedule]</BOLD></P4>
<P4><BOLD>1927 Act [Company's Authorities, Tab 7, cl.2, 5 and 9 of Schedule]</BOLD></P4></P3></P2></P1></P>
<P>40. The intention of the Legislature to mandate arbitration and bind third parties is clear on the face of the statutes and the agreements which they modify and confirm. Clause 2. (n) of the schedule to the 1927 Act confirms that arbitration is obliged where it is provided in the Act or the Agreement of 1915 and nothing amends that obligation since 1927. There is no ambiguity in the clear wording and remedial interpretation or in the continuity with the objective of promoting business and enterprise by allowing development to proceed while preserving a commercially efficient mechanism of dispute resolution for disputes or claims which may result.</P>
<P>41. Since 1927 there have been no amendments to the Legislation which alter the Arbitration Submission. The compulsory arbitration legislated in 1927 continues in full force and effect today.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Issue"><N>2</N><TI>DID JUSTICE HURLEY ERR IN DECLINING TO EXERCISE DISCRETION TO DENY THE STAY APPLICATION?</TI>
<P>42. Contrary to assertions by the Appellant, having concluded that the Legislation directs arbitration for the resolution of disputes such as the cause of action asserted by the Appellants, Justice Hurley correctly considered the applicable common law and statutes to determine whether a stay was appropriate.</P>
<P>43. The <EM>Judicature Act</EM> provides as follows in section 97:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>97.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>The court may direct a stay of proceedings pending before it.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>A person, whether or not that person is a party to the proceeding

<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>who may be entitled to enforce an order, contrary to which proceedings may have been taken,</PARAP></PARA>
may apply in a summary way for a stay of the proceedings either generally or where necessary for the purposes of justice, and the court shall make the order that may be just.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c. J-4 [Company's Authorities, Tab 9, s.97]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. The common law has variously considered when a stay is appropriate and has generated a consistent body of jurisprudence illuminating the issue, which jurisprudence Justice Hurley has appropriately considered and applied in the Reasons for Decision. The Company adopts and confirms its submissions on the Stay Application in reference to point.

<P1><BOLD>Memorandum of Fact and Law of the Company [Appeal Book, Tab 9, paras. 32&ndash;40]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. With specific reference to the generally accepted approach of extending deference to the legislature's express preference for arbitration:
<P1>(a) In the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Alberici Western Constructors Ltd. v Saskatchewan Power Corp.</SOC></CASEREF> the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench granted two applications to stay proceedings on the basis that the issues were governed by arbitration provisions. Citing a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, the Court articulates &ldquo;the general attitude courts have adopted in the treatment of these [arbitration] clauses&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>59 While the foundational principles are clear, in recent years, courts of all levels have recognized the many benefits of consensual contractual arbitration and have adopted a broad-minded attitude to the applicability and interpretation of such clauses. This is consistent with, and in keeping with, the amendments to the arbitration legislation across Canada and internationally. Geoff R. Hall, in his text &ldquo;Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law, 2d ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2012), states (at pp. 227-28):</BOLD>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The courts have repeatedly held that arbitration clauses are to be given a large and liberal interpretation. The position in Quebec is the same as in common law Canada. This approach has an unabashed policy goal: it furthers the modern trend of comity being extended by the judiciary to private dispute resolution procedures which have been adopted by the parties. <UNDER><EM>It also reflects the policy embodied in the modern Arbitration Acts that directs the court's not to interfere in arbitrations</EM></UNDER>. Such an approach is different from that which prevailed in an earlier era, in which the courts jealously guarded their jurisdiction and tended to interpret arbitration provisions narrowly. Cases from that era are now not followed. [<UNDER>Emphasis added</UNDER>]</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Alberici Western Constructors Ltd. v Saskatchewan Power Corp.</SOC><CITE>2015 SKQB 74</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2015] S.J. No. 134</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> <BOLD>(upheld on appeal, 2016 SKCA 46 (CanLII)) [Company's Authorities, Tab 1, para. 59]</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>(b) This Court in its decision on <CASEREF><SOC>Midnight Marine Ltd. v Oppenheim</SOC></CASEREF> has likewise recognized the preference to favour arbitration where it has been directed by the Legislature.
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>[58] At paras. 59&ndash;70, Clarke J. also reviewed the English cases. He noted, as one of four factors bearing on the interpretation of the arbitration clause in Ace Capital, the strong U.S. policy in favour of arbitration, embodied in the Federal Arbitration Act and confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.</SOC><CITE>103 S.Ct. 927</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>(U.S. 1983):</BOLD>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should be resolved in favour of arbitration whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or the like defence to arbitrability.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD>The same policy in favour of arbitration is found in this Province's International Commercial Arbitration Act, RSNL 1990, c. 1&ndash;15. This statute incorporates the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards and the Model Law on International Arbitration, adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, into the law of this Province.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Midnight Marine Ltd. v Oppenheim</SOC><CITE>2010 NLCA 64</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Company's Authorities, Tab 2, Para. 58]</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>46. Arbitration is recognized to be an accessible, efficient and effective dispute resolution procedure, particularly in circumstances where interests of the general public are impacted by operation and policy of legislatively-sanctioned rights. For example, the Province directs arbitration in lieu of litigation in the following circumstances:
<P1>(a) Pursuant to the <EM>Petroleum and Natural Gas Act</EM>, where a permitee or a leasee to drilling rights for petroleum is alleged to have caused damage or injury to a third party property owner by exercise of rights under such permit or lease, the claims for such damage or injury must be determined by arbitration.</P1>
<P1>(b) The <EM>Petroleum Regulations</EM> under the <EM>Petroleum and Natural Gas Act</EM> further provide that, where an interest holder disputes a decision of the minister with respect to renewal or termination or suspension of obligations, as prescribed therein, that dispute shall be referred to arbitration.</P1>
<P1>(c) Under the <EM>Muskrat Falls Project Land Use and Expropriation Act</EM>, the proponent has authority to expropriate in order to proceed with the project and, if no direct agreement can be reached, the compensation of any land owner incidentally impacted shall be determined by arbitration.</P1>
<P1>(d) Pursuant to the <EM>City of St. John's Act</EM>, if an approved development should result in the alteration of streets, requiring the expropriation of adjoining land, the City can expropriate such land as it deems appropriate and the resulting loss to the landowner shall be determined by arbitration.
<P2><BOLD><EM>Petroleum and Natural Gas Act</EM>, RSNL1990 c P-10 [Company's Authorities, Tab 13, s. 21]</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Petroleum Regulations under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Act</EM>, CNLR 1151/96 [Company's Authorities, Tab 14, s. 68]</BOLD></P2>

<P2><BOLD><EM>City of St. John's Act</EM>, RSNL1990 c C-17 [Company's Authorities, Tab 6, s. 83]</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>47. Justice Hurley specifically accepted the ratio of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Ruddell v BC Rail Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, where it was held that because the preference for arbitration was found in a statute enacted by the legislature such preference would displace the right to otherwise bring a class proceeding. The Court accordingly issued a stay of proceedings, noting the efficiency and flexibility of arbitration, as well as the potentially broad application of an arbitration decision, as factors mitigating in favour of arbitration.

<P>48. In its first recital the Agreement of 1915 states its objective to be: &ldquo;... to promote the development of all enterprises in the Colony which utilize its products and resources and create new industries.&rdquo; There is no suggestion that the Province exceeded its jurisdiction in determining the terms and conditions for such enterprise, including setting the mechanism for resolution of any disputes resulting from the exploitation of public resources. Having exercised such jurisdiction it does not behoove this Court to second guess the decisions made and agreements reached by the Province.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Town supports the Appellants in the within appeal. It adopts the facts and argument as set out in the Appellants' Factum.</P>
<P>2. In addition to the arguments raised by the Appellants, the applications judge incorrectly concluded that the Arbitration Clause applied in the same manner to claims between the Government and the Company as compared to those between the Company and third parties, such as the Appellants. In doing so, the applications judge incorrectly applied the modern approach to statutory interpretation and committed an error in law.</P>
<P>3. The applications judge committed a reviewable error in failing to consider and exercise his discretionary power under the Arbitration Act to refrain from staying the proceedings against the Company. The applications judge's reasons failed to address or consider the Judicial Discretion Provision in the Arbitration Act and, in doing so, failed to distinguish the relied upon jurisprudence in light of the Judicial Discretion Provision that is unique to our Arbitration Act.</P>
<P>4. The Town respectfully submits that the applications judge committed reviewable errors in his findings of law. The Decision ought to be overturned, and the Jurisdiction Application denied.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>5. The Fourth Respondent, the Town of Deer Lake (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Town&rdquo;</BOLD>), agrees with the Concise Statement of Facts as set out in the Appellants' Factum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;LIST OF THE ISSUES</TI>
<P>6. The Appellants have provided a list of issues for consideration by this Court:</P>
<P>7. What is the appropriate standard of review in the within appeal?</P>
<P>8. Did the applications judge commit reviewable errors in failing to apply the proper principles of statutory interpretation, and in so doing concluding that clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Arbitration Clause&rdquo;</BOLD>) required the Appellants to refer their claims against the Company to arbitration?</P>
<P>9. Did the applications judge err in declining to exercise discretion to dismiss the Jurisdiction Application?</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Standard of review</TI>
<P>10. The governing authority on the standard of review in a civil proceeding is <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC></CASEREF>. The Town agrees with the Appellants in their identification of the applicable jurisprudence on this point.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Factum of the Appellants at &para;52, p 14.</P1>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2002] 2 SCR 235</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>11. The Town agrees with the Appellants that the standard applicable to Issue 1 is correctness. The Town further agrees that Issue 2 is an exercise in discretion and the applicable standard of review would be one of palpable and overriding error, unless the error amounted to an error at law, which would be subject to a standard of correctness.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Factum of the Appellants at &para;&para;53-54, p 14.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Legislation does not Prescribe Arbitration of the Appellants' Claims</TI>
<P>12. The applications judge was incorrect in his determination that the Arbitration Clause in the 1927 Act requires arbitration of the Appellants' claims, which warrants interference on appeal.</P>
<P>13. The 1927 Act does not mandate arbitration with respect to the Appellants' claims, and the Appellants have the residual remedy to litigate their dispute with the Company in the court of inherent jurisdiction, being the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador.</P>
<P>14. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the seminal decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, the modern approach to statutory interpretation requires a reading of the words of an Act &ldquo;in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament&rdquo;.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <CASEREF><SOC>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</SOC><CITE>[1998] 1 SCR 27</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1998] SCJ No 2</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at &para;21, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix A, Tab 7.</P1></P>
<P>15. This modern approach to statutory interpretation is also reflected in the <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c 1&ndash;19, which provides:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>16.</N><TI>Rule of construction</TI><SECP>Every Act and every regulation and every provision of an Act or regulation shall be considered remedial and shall receive the liberal construction and interpretation that best ensures the attainment of the objects of the Act, regulation, or provision according to its true meaning.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c 1&ndash;19, at s 16, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 13.</P1></P>
<P>16. The Town submits that the learned applications judge correctly concluded that the 1915 Act did not restrict the Appellants' claims to arbitration. As noted in the Decision, there is apparent incongruity between clause 15 of the 1915 agreement and section 14 of the 1915 Act, which provisions are replicated side by side for ease of reference below:

<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation Limited, Cap 4, 6 Geo v (1915), Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 10 [1915 Act].</P1></P>
<P>17. While clause 15 of the 1915 agreement purports to mandate arbitration with respect to any dispute between the Company and private interests, the 1915 Act provides a residual right for a claimant to commence an action in the Court of competent jurisdiction. The interplay of these two seemingly conflicting provisions appears to provide potential claimants with the ability to elect the procedural vehicle in pursuing a dispute with the Company despite the provision for arbitration.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Decision at &para;&para;25-26, Appeal Book, Tab 3, p 16.</P1></P>
<P>18. The Town acknowledges that the Arbitration Clause in the 1923 Act is broad in its provision of arbitration. The 1923 Act is silent with respect to a residual right for a claimant to pursue litigation in lieu of arbitration, but it does not expressly repeal the 1915 Act. The Town agrees with the learned applications judge's conclusion that the 1923 Act and agreement does not amend or vary the rights of a claimant to initiate and purse a claim in Court as was provided in the 1915 Act.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Decision at &para;37, Appeal Book, Tab 3, p 19.</P1>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: An Act Further to Amend the Act 6 George V(1915), Chapter Four, Entitled &ldquo;An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited&rdquo;, Cap 1, 14 Geo v (1923), Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 11 [1923 Act].</P1></P>
<P>19. The Arbitration Clause in the 1927 Act expressly replaces the Arbitration Clause in the 1923 Act.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: An Act for the Confirmation of an Agreement Between the Government and International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited&rdquo;, Cap 4, 28 Geo v (1927), Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 [1927 Act].</P1></P>
<P>20. The 1927 Act, and more particularly the Arbitration Clause, does not expressly repeal or replace the 1915 agreement or the 1915 Act. Rather, section 2 of the 1927 Act adopts all &ldquo;rights, powers, privileges, franchises and exemptions vested in, or owned or enjoyed by the Old Company [Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited] <UNDER><EM>under the Act and Agreement of 1915</EM></UNDER>...&rdquo; (emphasis added)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tab 1 of the Applicant's Book of Authorities, p36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1927 Act</EM>, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 at p 36.</P1></P>
<P>21. It follows that the residual right to litigate provided for in section 14 of the 1915 Act is in fact preserved insofar as the Arbitration Clause in the 1927 Act contemplates.</P>
<P>22. As noted above, the Arbitration Clause as set out in the 1927 Act provides:
<QUOTE><P><EM>(n) Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company; but the following provision shall apply to the Company:</EM></P>
<P><EM>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto</EM>, <BOLD><EM>or between the Company and third parties where provision for arbitration is made herein</EM></BOLD>, <EM>or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party by submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. One arbitrator shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two so appointed. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within twenty days of the appointment of the second of such two, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may upon application be either party appoint such arbitrator or arbitrators. The award of the arbitrators or any two of them shall be final and binding upon the parties therefore, unless appeal therefrom shall be made to the Supreme Court and notice of such appeal shall be filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of such award</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[emphasis Added]</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1927 Act</EM>, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 at p 50.</P1></P>
<P>23. The applications judge erred in concluding that &ldquo;contrary to the position advanced by the Town, it would be unreasonable to exclude claims between the Company and third parties from the scope of this clause in view of the language of the provision&rdquo;. With respect, this is incorrect. The grammatical structure of the Arbitration Clause is significant as it provides for arbitration between the Company and third parties, such as the Appellants, only where provision for arbitration is made in the 1927 Act and agreement.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Decision at &para;43, Appeal Book, Tab 3, p 20.</P1></P>
<P>24. Specifically, the first component of the Arbitration Clause broadly states that any questions or disputes between the &ldquo;parties hereto&rdquo; of the 1927 agreement, being the Governor of Newfoundland and its Dependencies, in Council, and th e International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited, are to be submitted to arbitration on the application of either party. Notably, third parties, such as the Appellants, are not parties to the 1927 agreement.</P>
<P>25. The provision for arbitration with respect to disputes between the Company and third parties is more limited. The emphasized portion of the Arbitration Clause above is a disjunctive clause, separated on either end by commas, that provides for arbitration only where it is prescribed elsewhere in the 1927 Act and agreement.</P>
<P>26. In reviewing the Arbitration Clause, it is evident that the Legislature did not intend for the provision of arbitration to be the same between the parties as compared to the Company and third parties. The treatment for these two groups is distinct, which is reflected in the grammatical construction of the Arbitration Clause. The applications' judge was incorrect in finding that the scope of the Arbitration Clause applied equally to disputes between the Company and the Government and those between the Company and third parties.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Decision at &para;43, Appeal Book, Tab 3, p 20.</P1></P>
<P>27. Other than the Arbitration Clause, the 1927 Act only contemplates arbitration in two other instances, being clause 8 and 9(d). Clause 8 is not material to the within proceedings. It provides, as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The Board of Railway Commissioners may enter into an agreement or agreements with the Company for furnishing to the Company and its subsidiaries all or any services over which the said Board now has or shall hereafter have jurisdiction at such rates and for such period and upon such terms and conditions, including provision for successive renewals and for the fixing</EM> <BOLD><EM>by arbitration</EM></BOLD> <EM>or otherwise of rates and other terms applicable to such renewals, as the said Board shall determine [emphasis added]</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1927 Act</EM>, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 at p 59.</P1></P>
<P>28. Clause 9(d) of the 1927 Act provides:
<QUOTE><P><EM>9. The Company may at any time or times do any or all of the following:</EM>
<P1>&ellipsis;</P1>
<P1><EM>(a) For the purpose of supplying water to the mills and other works of the Company and any towns in or near which the same are located, the Company may divert, stop or dam up and regulate the flow of such bodies of water as it may deem necessary or desirable and take and use such water and transmit the same by means of either natural or artificial channels or by other conduits; and made regulations for safeguarding such water supply from pollution, which regulations when approved by the Governor in Council shall have the force and effect of law;</EM> <BOLD><EM>provided that where the common law rights of riparian owners are affected thereby, compensation to be settled between the parties or by arbitration as provided thereunder, shall be made by the Company...</EM></BOLD> <EM>[emphasis added]</EM>.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1927 Act</EM>, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 at p 61.</P1></P>
<P>29. The Appellants' claims, as set out in the Statement of Claim, are framed broadly in nuisance and negligence and do not expressly contemplate a breach of common law riparian rights.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Statement of Claim issued May 22, 2015, Appeal Book, Tab 4, p 26.</P1></P>
<P>30. The essential character of the Appellants' claims fall outside the scope of clause 9(d) of the 1927 Act that provides for the determination of compensation to be paid by the Company to common law riparian owners that are injuriously affected by the Company's activities by way of arbitration.</P>
<P>31. The Town submits that as the Appellants' claims are not captured in the subject matter of the mandatory arbitration provisions that are provided elsewhere in the 1927 Act and agreement, it follows that the dispute between the Company and the Appellants' are not caught by the Arbitration Clause and are not precluded from litigating the matter before the court of inherent jurisdiction, being the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Proceeding should not be stayed against the Company</TI>
<P>32. The Town submits that the applications judge committed a further reviewable error in failing to exercise its discretion under the <EM>Arbitration Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c A-14 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Arbitration Act&rdquo;</BOLD>), to refrain from staying the proceedings against the Company. In particular, the Decision is absent of any consideration of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, which is an error of law.</P>
<P>33. Section 4 of the Arbitration Act provides:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>4.</N><TI>Staying proceedings</TI><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>Where a party to a submission, or a person claiming through or under a party, begins legal proceedings against another party to the submission, or a person claiming through or under a party, in respect of a matter agreed to be referred, a party to the legal proceedings may, after appearance and before delivering pleadings or taking other steps in the proceedings, apply to the court for an order staying the proceedings.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>The court may make an order staying the proceedings under subsection (1), upon being satisfied,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the submission; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>that the applicant was, at the time the proceedings started, and still is ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>Arbitration Act</EM>, RSNL 1990, c A-14, at s 4, Tab 5.</P1></P>
<P>34. Unlike the comparable legislation in other jurisdictions, the Arbitration Act in this Province provides a residual discretion for the Court to refrain from staying proceedings and referring a matter to arbitration (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Judicial Discretion Provision&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>35. The Judicial Discretion Provision has been part of arbitration legislation in this Province since 1916 and has remained largely unchanged since that time. The first iteration of the Judicial Discretion Provision is found in Part VI of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, c 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series) (the <BOLD>&ldquo;1916 Judicature Act&rdquo;</BOLD>), which provides:
<QUOTE><P><EM>195. If any party to a submission, or any person claiming through or under him, commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the submission, or any person claiming through or under him, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may at any time after appearance, and before delivering any pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the Court to stay proceedings, and the Court or a Judge thereof, if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the submission, and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings. [emphasis added]</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, c 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), at s 195, Tab 7 [<EM>1916 Judicature Act</EM>].</P1></P>
<P>36. The term &ldquo;submission&rdquo; is defined in the 1916 Judicature Act as a &ldquo;written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named therein or not&rdquo;.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1916 Judicature Act</EM>, at s 214, Tab 7.</P1></P>
<P>37. The Arbitration Clause in the 1927 Act also refers to the 1916 Judicature Act with respect to the procedure to be followed upon reference to arbitration:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party by submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators</EM> <BOLD><EM>and the provisions of Part VI of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission</EM></BOLD>. <EM>One arbitrator shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two so appointed. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within twenty days of the appointment of the second of such two, the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may upon application be either party appoint such arbitrator or arbitrators. The award of the arbitrators or any tow of them shall be final and binding upon the parties therefore, unless appeal therefrom shall be made to the Supreme Court and notice of such appeal shall be filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of such award. [emphasis added]</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>1927 Act</EM>, Factum of the Appellants, Appendix B, Tab 12 at p 50.</P1></P>
<P>38. Notably, the Arbitration Clause does not override the judicial discretion provided for in section 195 of the 1916 Judicature Act.</P>
<P>39. The Judicial Discretion Provision continued to be housed in the subsequent iterations of the 1916 Judicature Act until 1984, at which time the statute underwent significant amendments. Specifically, the <EM>Judicature Act, 1984</EM>, no longer included provisions with respect to the procedures for the conduct of arbitration. Instead, these provisions, including the Judicial Discretion Provision, were enacted in the <EM>Arbitration Act</EM> in 1985. The Judicial Discretion Provision has continued in substance since that time.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>The Judicature Act, 1984</EM>, SNL 1984, c 25, Tab 9.</P1>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: <EM>The Arbitration Act</EM>, SNL 1985, c 8, at s 4, Tab 8.</P1></P>
<P>40. It follows that Legislature has clearly contemplated a residual judicial discretion to refrain from a stay of proceedings for arbitration since 1916, which was in force at the time of the enactment of the 1927 Act and agreement.</P>
<P>41. The Town agrees with the application judge's decision that Canadian courts have largely affirmed arbitrators' jurisdiction and stayed proceedings in favour of arbitration; however, the applications judge erred in failing to distinguish these decisions in the circumstances in light of the Judicial Discretion Provision that is unique to our Arbitration Act.
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Decision at &para;52, Appeal Book, Tab 3, p 22.</P1></P>
<P>42. For instance, the Decision relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Weber v Ontario Hydro</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Weber v Ontario Hydro</SOC><CITE>[1995] 2 SCR 929</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Weber</EM>], at Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as a leading case to illustrate the Supreme Court of Canada's articulation of an arbitrator's exclusive jurisdiction over all aspects of a dispute in matters where the Legislature had directed matters to be resolved by way of arbitration.

<P>43. At the time the <EM>Weber</EM> case was decided, the Ontario <EM>Arbitration Act, 1991</EM>, SO 1991, c 17, provided:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>7.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><TI>Stay</TI><SSECP>If a party to an arbitration agreement commences a proceeding in respect of a matter to be submitted to arbitration under the agreement, the court in which the proceeding is commenced shall, on the motion of another party to the arbitration agreement, stay the proceeding.</SSECP></SSEC>

<P><EM>[emphasis added]</EM></P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Reference</UNDER>: Arbitration Act, 1991, SO 1991, c 17, at s 7, Tab 6.</P1></P>
<P>44. It is evident that the Ontario legislation in force at that time provided limited circumstances where the Court could refrain from ordering a stay of proceedings. Unlike the Judicial Discretion Provision, section 7 of the Ontario <EM>Arbitration Act, 1991</EM>, suggests the Ontario legislature intended for arbitration to be enforced in all but very specific circumstances. The applications judge, in failing to distinguish the Ontario legislation, incorrectly applied the law.</P>
<P>45. In comparison, Courts in this jurisdiction have considered the Judicial Discretion Provision when refraining to order a stay of proceedings. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hurley v Slate Ventures Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Green J. (as he then was) refused to order a stay of proceedings where a shareholders' agreement mandating arbitration only pertained to certain aspects of the content of the litigation. The Plaintiff shareholder had commenced a legal action but then requested a stay of proceedings for the aspects of the litigation that were contemplated in the arbitration provision. Green J. refused, stating:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[47] ... Some of the issues and certainly much of the evidence will overlap the matters properly referable to arbitration under the agreement. Unless the matters are easily severable and can be discreetly compartmentalized, it would not be appropriate to delay court proceedings to enable an arbitration of some of the issues to be dealt with, especially where issues dealt with in the arbitration might also have been canvassed in the subsequent court proceedings, albeit from a different point of view. Here, the matters are intertwined. It is not sufficient for Hurley to say that he would agree to be bound by any findings of fact made at the arbitration. Evidence relating to the events in dispute would have to be covered again and may be presented differently. One cannot say in advance what the findings at the arbitration might be or how they will impact on the issues that will ultimately be before the court. The possibility of conflicting findings remain</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[48] Additionally, it is important that all outstanding issues between the parties be resolved in a timely manner. A bifurcation of the dispute between arbitration and court proceedings will only have the potential of lengthening the resolution</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[49] Traditional principles applicable to determine when a court will not insist that a matter proceed to arbitration</EM>, <BOLD><EM>even though the parties have agreed to such a course, recognize that although as a general rule the court ought to allow the issue to be settled in the agreed upon forum the court nevertheless retains a discretion to order that the issues not go to arbitration in appropriate cases</EM></BOLD> <EM>[three references in Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island cases]. Here, where all the issues raised by Hurley cannot be resolved by arbitration and where the issues that could be referred to arbitration arising out of &ldquo;any matter or thing concerning or relating to [the] agreement&rdquo; are essentially ones of law relating to the construction of the agreement, I believe it makes sense that the court should not defer to the request of the Plaintiff and should deny the reference to arbitration [emphasis added]</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>46. Similar to the litigation in <EM>Hurley</EM>, the within proceedings cannot be arbitrated in its entirety as only the Appellants and the Company would be party to arbitration, if it is ordered.</P>
<P>47. In <CASEREF><SOC>Marine Atlantic Inc. v Seabase Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, Hickman C.J. adopted the following criteria for determining whether a dispute should be resolved under the provisions of an arbitration clause or whether the Court should assume jurisdiction and determine the rights of the parties:
<QUOTE><P><EM>1. If the agreement for arbitration covers the claim as set out in the pleadings, it is the prima facie duty of the court to allow the issue to be settled in the agreed upon forum, and to grant the stay of proceedings;</EM></P>
<P><EM>2. The onus lies upon him who opposes the stay to satisfy the court that there is sufficient reason why the matter should be proceeded with in that agreed forum;</EM></P>
<P><EM>3. It is incumbent upon the court at this stage to inquire into the merits of the issue or issues but it must first determine:</EM></P>
<P><EM>(a) the precise nature of the issues between the parties;</EM></P>
<P><EM>(b) whether or not those issues fall within the terms of the arbitration clause;</EM></P>
<P><EM>(c) whether the arbitration clause is still operative;</EM></P>
<P><EM>4. the court may consider that sufficient reason exists why the issues should not go to arbitration</EM></P>
<P><EM>(a) if the questions to be determined are ones of law, or relating to the construction of the agreement, or of a complexity of mixed fact and law</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>48. Hickman, C.J.'s comments in <EM>Marine Atlantic</EM> were cited with approval by Butler J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Wheeler v Hwang</SOC></CASEREF> as the onus is on the contesting party to demonstrate why the matter ought not to proceed to arbitration.

<P>49. In the present case, the interests of justice would not be best served in ordering a stay of proceedings. The bifurcation of proceedings between a court action and arbitration may lead to different factual findings and are also not an optimal use of judicial resources. The Town submits that the applications judge committed a reviewable error in failing to exercise his discretion to stay the proceedings.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER OR RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>50. The Town requests that this Court answer the issues raised on this appeal as follows:</P>
<P>51. The standard of review on the questions before this Court is correctness.
<P1>(a) Issue 1: The applications judge erred in concluding that the Arbitration Clause in the 1927 Act required the Appellants to refer their claims against the Company to arbitration.</P1>
<P1>(b) Issue 2: The applications judge erred in declining to exercise discretion to dismiss the Jurisdiction Application.</P1></P>
<P>52. The Town therefore seeks that the appeal be dismissed.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;Overview</TI>
<P>1. The Appellants appeal a decision of the applications judge granting an application by Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Company (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) to stay the Appellants' action against the Company pending arbitration of the Appellants' claim with the Company. The appeal raises issues of the proper interpretation of arbitration provisions contained in historic legislation. The appeal also engages the alternate argument of a review of a discretionary decision of the applications judge to not stay the action against the Company.</P>
<P>2. The Province argues that the applications judge erred in his interpretation of the arbitration clauses and that the relevant legislation does not operate to bar the claims made by the Appellants against the Company.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;Concise Statement of Facts</TI>
<P>3. The Appellants issued a statement of claim wherein they allege that flooding has caused water damage to their properties. As against the Company, the Appellants seek damages for interference with their property rights in nuisance and negligence.</P>
<P>4. The Company brought an application seeking to have the claim as against them stayed (the &ldquo;Stay Application&rdquo;). The Company alleges the action is barred by certain arbitration provisions contained within the legislation and agreements outlined below:
<P1>&bull; <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of an Agreement Between the Government and International Paper Company of Newfoundland, Limited</EM> (the &ldquo;1927 Act&rdquo;) and the attached Schedule (the &ldquo;1927 Agreement&rdquo;);
<P2><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 12</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>&bull; <EM>An Act to Amend the Act 6 George V. (1915), Chapter Four, Entitled &ldquo;An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Limited&rdquo;</EM> (the &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo;) and Part II of the Schedule to the 1923 Act (the &ldquo;1923 Agreement&rdquo;); and,
<P2><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 11</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>&bull; <EM>An Act for the Confirmation of a Contract with the Newfoundland Products Corporation</EM> (the &ldquo;1915 Act&rdquo;) and the attached Schedule (the &ldquo;1915 Agreement&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>5. The applications judge concluded that under the 1915 Act a claimant had the right to pursue a claim in Court and was not restricted to arbitration and that this right was not amended or varied by the 1923 Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Applications Judge's Decision at paras 14&ndash;26 and para 37, Appeal Book, Tab 3</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. The applications judge determined that the 1927 Agreement &ldquo;effectively take[s] away the right to litigate a claim in Court in favour of mandatory arbitration.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Applications Judge's Decision at para 42, Appeal Book, Tab 3</BOLD></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>7.</BOLD> The applications judge found that neither the Appellants, the Town, nor the Province established that the Court should not follow the legislation which mandated arbitration.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;Issues</TI>
<P>8. The following are submitted as the issues relevant to determine this appeal:
<P1>(1) Is there a provision for mandatory arbitration in an act or agreement that prohibits the Appellants' action against the Company?</P1>
<P1>(2) Did the applications judge err in declining to exercise discretion to deny the Stay Application?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">Part IV Argument</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>9. The Province agrees with the Appellants' submissions as to the standard of review applicable to this appeal. The Province agrees that the standard applicable to Issue 1 is correctness and that Issue 2 involves the exercise of discretion of the Applications Judge and therefore the standard of review is palpable and overriding error, unless the error amounted to an error of law, which would be subject to a standard of correctness.</P>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N>1</N><TI>Is there a provision for mandatory arbitration in an act or agreement that prohibits the Appellants' action against the Company?</TI>
<P>10. It is respectfully submitted that the applications judge was incorrect in his determination that the 1927 legislation requires mandatory arbitration of the Appellants' claim against the Company.</P>
<P>11. Under the modern approach to statutory interpretation, it is well established that the &ldquo;words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament&rdquo;. In addition, the provincial legislature has provided that statutes must generally receive the liberal construction and interpretation that best ensures the attainment of the objects of the Act or provision according to its true meaning.</P>
<P>12. In order to interpret the arbitration clause, it must be read in context, including the immediate context of the language of the relevant section and the statute as a whole, and its intended meaning gleaned within that context. The text of the provision must be read harmoniously with the context and purpose of the statute.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Penney v. Newfoundland and Labrador</SOC><CITE>2017 NLCA 25</CITE><PARANUM>17-18</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>First Respondents Factum, Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. In order to determine whether the Appellants' claim should be stayed, the Court must first interpret the arbitration provisions and then analyse the Appellants' claim to determine whether that claim must be decided by an arbitrator under the terms of the agreement, as interpreted by the Court.</P>
<P>14. Clause 2(n) of the 1927 Agreement appended to the 1927 Act is the relevant arbitration Clause 2(n) provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Clause 8 of the Agreement of 1923 shall not apply to the Company: but the following provision shall apply to the Company:
<QUOTE><P>Any questions, disputes or differences between the parties hereto, or between the Company and third parties where provision for arbitration is made herein, or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements, or the execution thereof, shall on the application of either party be submitted to the arbitration of three arbitrators and the provisions of Part VI. of the Judicature Act, Chapter 83 of the Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), except Section 212 and except as modified in this Clause, shall apply to any such submission. (...)</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The opening wording of clause 2 of the 1927 Agreement confirms the rights enjoyed and the obligations imposed by the 1915 legislation and agreements and subsequent acts and agreements, except as modified or otherwise affected by the 1927 legislation. The 1927 legislation specifically amended the arbitration provision in the 1923 Agreement.</P>
<P>16. As a result of the 1927 amendment, in relation to disputes between the Company and third parties, clause 2(n) mandates that arbitration <UNDER>only applies</UNDER> &ldquo;...where provision for arbitration is made herein [the 1927 legislation], or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements...&rdquo;. Therefore, to determine whether the Appellants claims against the Company are captured by mandatory arbitration it is necessary to consider where provision for arbitration is made in relation to disputes between the Company and third parties in the relevant acts and agreements.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Arbitration Clauses</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK6><TI>&bull; 1927 Act and Agreement</TI>
<P>17. Aside from clause 2(n), the only arbitration provisions applicable to third parties within the 1927 legislation are found in clause 8 and clause 9(d) of the 1927 Agreement.</P>
<P>18. Clause 8 is not material as it is specific to disputes between the Company and the Board of Railway Commissioners.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Clause 9(d) provides the Company with rights to dam up and regulate the flow of certain water
<QUOTE><P>...;provided that where the common law rights of riparian owners are affected thereby, compensation to be settled between the parties or by arbitration as provided hereunder, shall be made by the Company.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. Pursuant to clause 9(d) of the 1927 legislation, when the common law riparian rights of third parties are affected by the Company's actions, if the third party and the Company cannot reach a settlement agreement on the compensation to be paid, then the question of compensation is to be settled by arbitration.</P>
<P>21. The Appellants' claim does not allege that they are riparian owners and the Appellants are not seeking compensation for the Company's interference with the common law rights of riparian owners. Therefore, it is submitted that clause 9(d) is not applicable to the within proposed class proceeding and therefore does not mandate arbitration between the Appellants and the Company.</P>
<P>22. Further, it is submitted that even if the Appellants' claim was based on common law riparian rights, the language of clause 9(d) requires that there be no dispute that it was the Company that affected the common law rights of the third parties. The arbitration provision referenced in clause 9(d) is only triggered &ldquo;where the common law rights of riparian owners <BOLD><UNDER>are affected thereby</UNDER></BOLD>&rdquo;. That is, where the third party's common law riparian rights are affected by the Company exercising its rights to, among other things, dam up and regulate the flow of water. It is submitted that the arbitration clause is operative only when there is not a dispute as to the Company's liability but there is a dispute as to the compensation payable for the Company's interference with these riparian rights. The arbitration is not to adjudicate whether or not the Company caused interference with such rights. The legislation only confers jurisdiction on the arbitrators to determine compensation, not liability.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI>&bull; 1923 Act and Agreement</TI>
<P>23. There is no arbitration provision within the 1923 Act that refers to arbitration with third parties.</P>
<P>24. Clause 8 of the 1923 Agreement outlines an arbitration process in relation to &ldquo;[a]ny questions, disputes or differences arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the execution thereof...&rdquo;. By application, &ldquo;either party&rdquo; can trigger this arbitration process. There is no reference to third parties in this provision. The parties to the agreement are the Governor of Newfoundland and the Newfoundland Power and Paper Company, Limited.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. It is submitted that the provisions of the 1923 legislation do not mandate arbitration between the Appellants and the Company.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI>&bull; 1915 Act and Agreement</TI>
<P>26. It is a matter of debate to what extent the 1927 Act and/or the 1923 Act amended or replaced the 1915 Act and the 1915 Agreement. However, it is submitted that regardless of the position, nothing in the 1915 Act or Agreement mandates arbitration for the Appellants' claim against the Company.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI>&bull; 1915 Agreement</TI>
<P>27. Clause 2 of the 1915 Agreement provides that in the event that the dams built by the Company become a benefit for other companies, then the other companies shall pay a proportionate cost of maintenance and operations. If the amount payable cannot be agreed upon, then the amount shall be determined by arbitration in the manner provided. This clause is not relevant to the Appellants' claim.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. Similarly, clause 3 of the 1915 Agreement requires the Company to furnish electrical power to third parties in Labrador at a price to be agreed upon. Failing agreement, the amount is to be settled by arbitration. Clause 3 sets out the procedure for arbitration related to such disputes. Clause 3 is not relevant to the Appellants' claim.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. Clause 10 of the 1915 Agreement provides the Company, with the consent of Government, the power to expropriate certain lands that the Company may require. Clause 10 sets out a different procedure for arbitration than the procedure contemplated in clause 3 of the 1915 Agreement. To determine compensation payable to the third parties, clause 10 requires arbitration in the manner provided by section 55 of the <EM>Lands Act</EM>. This clause is not relevant to the Appellants' claim.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. Clause 15 of the 1915 Agreement states the following:
<QUOTE><P>If the Company, in or by reason of the exercise of any of the rights hereby granted, submerge, destroy, damage or injuriously affect any private rights, interests, lands or property, and shall be unable to agree with the owner thereof as to compensation to be paid therefor, the Company, with the consent of the Governor in Council, may proceed with the exercise of the said rights, by these presents granted to the said Company, and the compensation to be paid by the Company to the owner, for or in respect to such rights, interests, lands or property, shall be settled by arbitration in the manner hereinbefore provided.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. Similar to clause 9(d) of the 1927 legislation, the Province submits that this provision is inoperative in relation to disputes about liability. Clause 15 contemplates arbitration in circumstances when the Company has accepted liability but is unable to agree with the owner as to the compensation to be paid. In the scenario contemplated by this provision, arbitration is not triggered until the Company has tried and failed to negotiate compensation with the private owner. In this provision the arbitrators are given jurisdiction to settle an amount owing to the third parties, however, the arbitrators are not given jurisdiction to determine liability.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI>&bull; 1915 Act</TI>
<P>32. The 1915 Act &ldquo;approved and confirmed, subject to the conditions and exceptions hereinafter contained&rdquo; the 1915 Agreement attached as a Schedule to the 1915 Act. As such, any changes in the 1915 Act amend the 1915 Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Section 1, 1915 Act, Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>33.</BOLD> Section 13 of the 1915 Act amends the arbitration procedure referred to in clause 10 of the 1915 Agreement. This applies to situations where the Company has expropriated land and arbitration is required to settle the amount of compensation.</P>
<P>34. Section 14 of the 1915 Act states
<QUOTE><P>Nothing herein or in the Schedule hereto in relation to the settlement of claims by arbitration shall be held or construed to prejudice or exclude the right of any claimant to institute an action in a Court of competent jurisdiction in respect to any such claim.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, Appendix B, Tab 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. Section 14 confirms that the arbitration provision does not preclude court action. Indeed, section 14 of the legislation is logical in light of clause 15 of the agreement as clause 15 only operates when liability is not in dispute. In situations where liability is an issue, the legislation confirms that litigation is an appropriate and permissible recourse.</P>
<P>36. Furthermore, there has been no amendment to section 14 in subsequent agreements or legislation, nor has there been a separate clause that would override this provision. Section 14 is a clear statement that the arbitration processes outlined in the legislation and agreements do not preclude court action.</P>
<P>37. Section 19 of the 1915 Act refers to arbitration when the Company's actions cause any material depreciation in the capacity for development of a water power owned by the holder of a grant, license or lease to cut timber. The Appellants' claim does not involve the development of a water power, therefore, this provision is not applicable.</P>
<P>38. The Province submits that clause 2(n), when read in the context of the agreements as a whole, means that all disputes between the Province and the Company are subject to arbitration, and that in relation to disputes between the Company and third parties, arbitration is mandatory only &ldquo;...where provision for arbitration is made herein [in the 1927 legislation] or in the Act or Agreement of 1915 or any of the Subsequent Acts and Agreements...&rdquo;.</P>
<P>39. The consideration of the phrase &ldquo;where provision for arbitration is made herein...&rdquo; is necessary to properly interpret the intended scope of arbitration between the Company and third parties. The rejection of the phrase is permissible only if it is otherwise impossible to reconcile or give effect to the Act.</P>
<P>40. Each provision of an act is presumed to have a role to play in the overall scheme. An interpretation of one provision that makes another redundant or that conflicts with other provisions strongly indicates that the legislature intended the provision be interpreted differently.
<P1><EM>Statutory Interpretation</EM>, Sullivan R. (3<SUP>rd</SUP> ed. 2016) at pp 173&ndash;179., Tab 1</P1></P>
<P>41. If you accept the Company's theory that all disputes must be referred to arbitration regardless if the dispute is between the Company and the Province, or if the dispute is between the Company and third parties, then what meaning is given to &ldquo;where provision for arbitration is made herein&rdquo;? Under the Company's theory, this phrase becomes superfluous, which is contrary to the established principles of statutory interpretation.</P>
<P>42. Clause 8 of the 1923 legislation provides that all issues between the parties are to be arbitrated. That was modified by clause 2(n) in the 1927 legislation to say that all disputes between the parties are to be arbitrated, and those disputes between the Company and third parties, where provision is made, are to be arbitrated.</P>
<P>43. As noted above, arbitration between the Company and third parties is mandated only in the following circumstances:

<P>44. In interpreting a statutory provision, one must look at the legislative context- that is, how the provision fits in and functions in the statutory scheme when considered together with other provisions.</P>
<P>45. Read as a whole, and considering how clause 2(n) fits in and functions in the statutory scheme, it is apparent that all of the arbitration provisions that apply to the Company and third parties deal with circumstances where an arbitrator would deal with a determination of quantum only. This interpretation forms and supports an internally consistent framework. The scheme of the acts and agreements is to provide arbitration in certain enumerated situations where the service or the liability is not in dispute, but the Company and the third party cannot agree as to the amount to be paid.</P>
<P>46. The Province submits that the subject matter of the Appellants' claim does not fall into any category of provision requiring arbitration in any of the relevant acts or agreements. Therefore, the Appellant's claim against the Company is not subject to clause 2(n) and the applications judge should not have allowed the Company's Stay Application.</P></BLOCK6></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
