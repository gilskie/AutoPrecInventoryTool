<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Overview of Issues</TI>
<P>1. At issue is the ruling issued by the Honourable Mr. Justice Mahar, dated October 30<SUP>st</SUP>, 2014. Justice Mahar granted the Respondent's application and set aside the Appellants' decision to deny payment of a rebate of taxes paid on petroleum products purchased by the Respondent. The Appellant had denied the rebate on the grounds that the Respondent had failed to meet the statutory deadline for application set out in Section 8 (4.1 of the <EM>Tax Rebate Regulations</EM> (&ldquo;the Regulations&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Justice Mahar held that the Appellant erred in its interpretation of Section 8 (4.1) of the Regulations. He held that the application deadline of March 31<SUP>st</SUP> applies only to fuel which is both bought into Nunavut <EM>and</EM> consumed in the previous calendar year. Justice Mahar further held that the Appellant was prevented from applying the deadline in Section 8(4.1) by application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel because it failed to take steps to inform the Respondent of a change to the regulatory deadline for applications.</P>
<P>3. The Appellant states that Justice Mahar's determination that it is prevented from applying the March 31<SUP>st</SUP> deadline to the Respondent's fuel tax application because of the operation of promissory estoppel is incorrect at law.</P>
<P>4. This Appeal raises an issue that is of central importance, both to the legal system as a whole, and to the Appellant in particular. The key core issue is whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel can act so as to prevent a government from relying on a statutory provision. The circumstances of this case do not give rise to the necessary elements of promissory estoppel, and that, even if estoppel could be demonstrated, it cannot serve to overcome a rule set out in statute.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Statement of Facts</TI>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>i.</EM></N><TI><EM>Introduction</EM></TI>
<P>5. The Respondent is engaged in mineral extraction in Nunavut and has entered into a Development Partnership Agreement (DPA) with the Appellant and is therefore eligible to apply for a rebate under Section 5 of the <EM>Regulations</EM>.</P>
<P>6. Between 2006 and 2012, The Respondent submitted seven applications for fuel tax rebates, two of which were wholly or partially denied because of missed deadlines. The Respondent has received $9.3 million in tax rebates between 2009 and 2014.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Daniel Young, Sworn on October 25, 2013</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 82.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. Under Subsection 8(4.1) of the <EM>Regulations</EM>, a company that applies for a fuel tax rebate under Section 5 must submit the application by no later than March 31<SUP>st</SUP> in the year immediately subsequent to the year in which the fuel was purchased in or brought into Nunavut.</P>
<P>8. On June 7, 2013, the Appellant received two applications from the Respondent, in which it sought a rebate of taxes paid on fuel purchased in 2012. The applications were post-marked May 23, 2013. The Applications included receipts showing that in June, July, and October 2012 AEM had purchased some 47,266,562 litres of diesel oil from Woodward's Oil Limited, and had paid tax on all of the petroleum products at the lowest rate of 3.1 cents per litre.
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, P15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. On July 12, 2013, the Appellant denied the Respondent's application for a fuel tax rebate on the grounds that it had not been submitted by the regulatory deadline of March 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2013.
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, P47</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. The Respondent sought judicial review of the Appellant's denial of the rebate. In aide of its application, the Respondent argued that Section 8(4.1) did not apply to it, and that, if it did apply, then the deadline for application will be March 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2014, not March 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2013. It also argued that, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the Appellant was prohibited from applying the March 31<SUP>st</SUP> deadline by operation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>ii.</EM></N><TI><EM>The Fuel Tax Regime in Nunavut</EM></TI>
<P>11. In Nunavut, as in other jurisdictions, fuel is taxed at varying rates depending on the purpose for which the fuel is used. These rates are set out in Section 2 of the <EM>Petroleum Products Tax Act</EM> (&ldquo;PPTA&rdquo;). The difference in tax rates based on various uses ranges from 0% tax for petroleum products used for home heating, to 17% for gasoline purchased on the highway system and used for purposes other than aviation. In most cases, this tax is payable on a prescribed amount that is deemed to be the price per litre, and not on the actual price per litre of petroleum products.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Petroleum Products Tax Act</EM> (Nunavut), R.S.N.W.T. (Nu) 1988, c. P-5 (&ldquo;<EM>PPTA</EM>&rdquo;), Ss. 2 (1)&mdash;2(7).</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. The fuel used by the Respondent in its operations falls under Subsections 2(1)(e) and (f) of the PPTA, meaning that the rate of tax is based on a prescribed taxable price per litre. The taxable price per litre is prescribed in the Regulations, and is currently set at 62.9 cents per litre, which means that the tax rates applicable to the Respondent are as follows:
<P1>i. in the case of diesel oil used in a motor vehicle, 9.1 cents per litre; and</P1>
<P1>ii. in the case of any other petroleum products, 3.1 cents per litre.</P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Petroleum Products Tax Regulations</EM>, R.R.N.W.T. 1990, c.P-3, s. 12(3).</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 2]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>PPTA</EM>, s. 2.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. Registered fuel importers can purchase fuel outside Nunavut and bring it into the territory without paying taxes on it until it is used. Importers submit monthly returns, setting out the quantity of fuel used, the purpose for which it was used, and the amount of taxes owing.
<P1><BOLD><EM>PPTA</EM>, s. 4(1).</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Those who do not import fuel and instead purchase it from an importer must pay taxes up front, before the fuel has been used. The vendor then remits the tax to the Minister.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>iii.</EM></N><TI><EM>The Fuel Tax Rebate Program</EM></TI>
<P>15. The Fuel Tax Rebate Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;) was introduced in 2006 through the promulgation of Regulations under the PPTA. Section 23 of the PPTA gives the Minister the right to make regulations granting rebates of tax or any portion of tax to any person eligible for a rebate and prescribing the proof to be provided on application for exemption or rebate.
<P1><BOLD><EM>PPTA, s. 23</EM></BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. The Program rebates territorial taxes to eligible individuals and companies who use fuel for qualified activities, including harvesting, quarrying for carving stone, outfitting, mineral exploration, and mining development, extraction or reclamation.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Tax Rebate Regulations</EM>, Nu Reg. 012-2006, ss. 2&ndash;5.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 3]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Daniel Young</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 81</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Companies engaged in mining extraction wishing to claim a rebate of fuel taxes must do so under Section 5 of the Regulations. Section 5 provides that a company engaged in mine development, extraction or reclamation activities is eligible to apply for a rebate of taxes paid on eligible petroleum products if it has entered into and is in compliance with a DPA:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>5.</N><SECP>A corporation incorporated or registered under the <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM> that engages in a particular mine development, mine extraction or mine reclamation is eligible to apply for a tax rebate on eligible petroleum products used directly for the purposes of that mine development, mine extraction or mine reclamation if the corporation has entered into and is in compliance with a development partnership agreement with the Government of Nunavut.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Tax Rebate Regulations</EM>, Nu Reg. 012-2006, s. 2</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 3]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The term &ldquo;eligible petroleum products&rdquo; is defined in the Regulations as &ldquo;petroleum products used in Nunavut in qualifying equipment and machinery&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Tax Rebate Regulations</EM>, Nu Reg. 012-2006, s. 1</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 3]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Section 8(4) of the Tax Rebate Regulations states that an application for a tax rebate must be submitted within one year after the petroleum products were purchased or brought into Nunavut.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Tax Rebate Regulations</EM>, Nu Reg. 012-2006, s. 8</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities Tab 3]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. In April 2012, the Executive Council approved amendments to the Regulations by means of Regulation R-008-2012. One of the changes was the addition of Section 8(4.1), which imposed a deadline of March 31st in respect of fuel tax rebate applications filed by companies under Section 5 of the Tax Rebate Regulations.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Daniel Young</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 82</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. Regulation R-008-2012 was published in the Nunavut Gazette on May 25, 2012, in accordance with the Statutory Instruments Act and the Public Printing Act. The Regulations were consolidated and an up to date version was posted by the Territorial Printer on the GN website on October 19, 2012.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Daniel Young</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 82</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Section 8(4.1) of the Tax Rebate Regulations applies only to those companies such as the Respondent, whose eligibility for the rebate flows from Section 5. It states that, despite subsection 8(4), an application made by a person referred to in Section 5 of the Regulations must be submitted on or before March 31st in respect of eligible petroleum products purchased in or brought into Nunavut in the preceding year.</P>
<P>23. The Respondent is a person referred to Section 5 of the Regulations.</P>
<P>24. In an affidavit submitted in aid of its application, the Respondent's Administrative Director testified that the Respondent did not meet the March 31st deadline for applying for the fuel tax rebate because it did not know about the deadline. She states that, in preparing and submitting its application for a fuel tax rebate, the Respondent used and relied upon 2009 Fuel Tax Rebate Guidelines found by Comptroller Valerie Drolet by means of an internet search using the search engine Google.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Manon Lessard, paras 47&ndash;50</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 8-9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. Ms. Lessard has testified that, even if the Respondent had been aware of the changes to the deadline for application, it could not have submitted its application by March 31, 2013, because it had not completely used the fuel that it had purchased in 2012 until August 2013, and therefore could not have known how it would be used. However, AEM ultimately filed its rebate application in May, three months before the fuel was fully consumed.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Manon Lessard, para. 63</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I, at 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. According to Ms. Lessard, AEM started using the fuel it had imported in 2012 in August of that year. By December 2012, it had consumed 27,559, 007 litres of fuel, out of a total of 63,411,381 of fuel imported in 2012. The fuel had been totally consumed by August of the following year.
<P1><BOLD>Affidvit of Manon Lessard, at para. 63</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume 1, at 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Each of the rebate applications filed by AEM contains the following comment in the comments section:

<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume 1, P14, P30</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. This Consolidation cited by the Respondent includes Subsection 8(4.1).</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;GROUNDS OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>29. The Appellant submits that the learned trial judge erred by:
<P1>a. concluding that the Appellant's actions amounted to a representation to the Respondent such that it was estopped from applying the regulatory deadline set out in Section 8 (4.1) of the Regulations; and</P1>
<P1>b. in concluding that the doctrine of promissory estoppel could overcome a statutory deadline.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;POINTS OF LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Standard of Review is correctness</TI>
<P>30. Where the Courts have already made a determination regarding the standard of review to be applied to a given question; the required analysis is deemed to have been performed and need not be repeated.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Net v Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir (&ldquo;Dunsmuir&rdquo;)</SOC><CITE>1 S.C.R. 190</CITE><PARANUM>57</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 4]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. At issue in this appeal is whether an equitable doctrine can serve to overcome the application of a statutory provision. As agreed by the parties and accepted by Justice Mahar, the standard of review in this matter is correctness.</P>
<P>32. Questions of law that are of central importance to the legal system and outside the adjudicator's specialized area of expertise will always attract a correctness standard. Courts must continue to substitute their own view of the correct answer where the question at issue is one of general law. These questions require uniform and consistent answers due to their impact on the administration of justice as a whole.

<BLOCK3><TI>The Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel requires a clear and unambiguous representation</TI>
<P>33. The doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied in rare circumstances in the public law context, predominantly in the criminal or strict liability context, where it has arisen under the guise of &ldquo;officially induced errors&rdquo;. However, the courts have held that, in the public law context, a clear and unambiguous statement by a public authority is required; actions or acquiescence will not ground a claim of promissory estoppel.

<P>34. In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Wagner summarized the prerequisites for the establishment of promissory estoppel in the public law context as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[19] In the public law context, promissory estoppel requires proof of a clear and unambiguous promise made to a citizen by a public authority in order to induce the citizen to perform certain acts. In addition, the citizen must have relied on the promise and acted on it by changing his or her conduct (<CASEREF><SOC>Mount Sinai Hospital Center v. Quebec (Minister of Health and Social Services)</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 41 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 281</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Mount Sinai</EM>&rdquo;), at paras. 45-46, quoting <CASEREF><SOC>Maracle v. Travellers Indemnity Co. of Canada</SOC><CITE>1991 CanLII 58</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1991] 2 S.C.R. 50</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>; J.-P. Villaggi, <EM>L'Administration publique qu&ea;b&ea;coise et le processus d&ea;cisionnel: Des pouvoirs au contr&oc;le administratif et judiciaire</EM> (2005), at p. 329).</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Ibid.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. In this case, Justice Mahar held that a government may be bound to act consistently with statements made to another party where that party has relied upon those statements. He canvassed the case law and determined that the Respondent had ordered its affairs in reliance upon the Appellant's Fuel Tax Guidelines.</P>
<P>36. Justice Mahar set out his reasons for finding that the Appellant's failure to update its Guidelines, coupled with its failure to advise the Respondent of the change to the Regulations, constituted a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; which effectively barred the Appellant from applying the Regulatory deadline.</P>
<P>37. Justice Mahar based his ruling on three key facts: the advent of the Internet, which he held, created a higher onus on the Appellant to ensure that the information it provides is kept up to date; the fact that only one taxpayer was affected by the regulatory change; the ongoing relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent; and the fact that the effort to contact the taxpayer directly and inform it of the change would have been minimal. He concluded that the combination of these factors constituted a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; by the Appellant not to make any changes to the regulatory regime without informing the Respondent:
<QUOTE><P>[85] The doctrine of promissory estoppel will be a rare and unusual remedy in tax cases, highly unusual when dealing with a taxpayer failing to follow specific statutory requirements. However, in this particular case, on these unusual facts, it is made out. The combined effect of the misguiding Guidelines, the less than helpful forms, and a reasonable reliance on the ongoing relationship between AEM and the Government leads to what is, in effect, a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; that the regime was continuing as it had before.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Appeal Book, Volume I F18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. The Appellant submits that Justice Mahar's determination that the Appellant's failure to update its Guidelines or to contact the Respondent directly constituted a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; sufficient in nature to ground promissory estoppels in the public law context is incorrect. It quite simply cannot be reconciled with the vast weight of the common law that precedes it.</P>
<P>39. Inaction, acquiescence, or inadvertence will not ground promissory estoppels in the public law context. What is required is a clear and unambiguous statement by an enforcement body to a regulated entity or person. Neither the Appellant's failure to update its Guidelines, nor its failure to contact the Respondent and advise it of the change to the Regulations are insufficient to ground promissory estoppel.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel cannot serve to overcome a statutory deadline</TI>
<P>40. Even if the Appellant's failure to update its Guidelines or inform the Respondent of the statutory change were determined to constitute a clear and unambiguous promise, it still would not protect the Respondent from the application of the regulatory deadline. The basic premise that equitable doctrines cannot overcome the application of statutory provisions is well established. Justice Wagner confirmed the law in this regard in the Robitaille decision:
<QUOTE><P>[20] However, the doctrine of estoppel must yield in the public law context to an overriding public interest and may not be invoked to prevent the application of an express legislative provision (<EM>Mount Sinai</EM>, at para. 47; <CASEREF><SOC>St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club Ltd. v. The King</SOC><CITE>1950 CanLII 28</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1950] S.C.R. 211</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 220</PAGENUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>).</P>
<P>[21] Furthermore, although the doctrine of estoppel has been applied against public authorities in the past, the promises made by the representatives of the authorities in those cases were not unlawful, or were actually consistent with a statutory discretion (<CASEREF><SOC>Re MultiMalls Inc. and Minister of Transportation and Communications</SOC><YEAR>1976</YEAR><CITE>1976 CanLII 623</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>14 O.R.

<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 6]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. At paragraph 30 of that same judgment, Justice Wagner clarified that, although the appeal was grounded in the penal law context, the principle is the same in the civil law context:
<QUOTE><P>[30] Nor, it should be added&mdash;although it is not necessary to do so to decide this appeal, which arises in a penal law context&mdash;can estoppel be raised as a defence in a civil proceeding relating to an express provision of a by-law in which a non-conforming use is at issue. <UNDER>The principle that estoppel cannot be raised in the face of an express legislative provision is valid both in the penal law context and in that of a civil proceeding</UNDER>.</P>
<P>(Emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ibid., at para. 30</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. Estoppel has been invoked by the courts to stop the unfairness that can occur where one party tries to withdraw a promise made to a second party when the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.</P>
<P>43. In <CASEREF><SOC>Maracle v Travellers Indemnity Co</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court described the doctrine as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The principles of promissory estoppel are well settled. The party relying on the doctrine must establish that the other party has, by words or conduct, made a promise or assurance which was intended to affect their legal relationship and to be acted on. Furthermore, the representee must establish that, in reliance on the representation, he acted on it or in some way changed his position.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Marack v Travellers Indemnity Co.</SOC><CITE>[1991] 2 S.C.R. 50</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 7]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. However, the doctrine of estoppel has its limits, the most notable of which is that it cannot operate to countermand statute or regulation. This was made clear by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Minister of National Revenue v. Inland Industries Ltd</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Inland Industries&rdquo;). In that case, the Minister of Revenue approved a retroactive payment by a taxpayer into a pension fund, the benefits of which would go to the sole shareholder of the taxpayer. The monies were then invested by loaning them to affiliated companies at a significantly high interest rate. The affiliated companies, who were constantly in debt to the taxpayer, simply remitted the monies to the taxpayer. The Minister alleged that the pension fund was a sham; the investors were acting as an agent of the taxpayer, not for the pension fund, and that the monies never really went into the pension fund, and therefore ought to have been taxed. The taxpayer appealed. Among the grounds for appeal were that the Minister had approved the plan with full knowledge, on the advice of the Superintendent of Insurance (a government agent as well). The Supreme Court held that the Minister could not be bound by an approval given where the conditions of the law were not met:
<QUOTE><P>The difference between the wording of this memorandum and the wording of the actuarial certificate is quite substantial and it is somewhat surprising that, notwithstanding such advice, departmental approval was given to the payments on behalf of the Minister. However, it seems clear to me that the Minister cannot be bound by an approval given when the conditions prescribed by the law were not met.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Minister of National Revenue v. Inland Industries Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1974] S.C.R. 514</CITE><PARANUM>6</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 8]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. Inland Industries stands for the principle that: the doctrines of estoppel and considerations of fairness cannot operate to overcome clear provisions of law, meaning that where a statute says that a taxpayer does not qualify for a rebate, neither incorrect advice, nor confusing bulletins can operate to nullify the effect of the statute or regulation.
<P1><BOLD>Ibid.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. In <CASEREF><SOC>Irving Oil Ltd. v. R.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Federal Court stated that the doctrine of estoppel and fairness does not apply to when the core issue is whether a statute has been correctly applied. The decision has been summarized as follows:
<QUOTE><P>3. The doctrine of estoppel and fairness did not apply where the issue was one of the correct interpretation or application of a statute as opposed to a decision on rights or entitlement by a statutory authority, particularly as it was in the public interest to recover the overpayment. Moreover, it was too speculative to contemplate whether 10 Ltd. would have ordered its affairs differently and avoided the overpayment of compensation had the old formula not been used. Also, the method adopted was one suggested by 10 Ltd. and acquiesced in by the board, not the other way around. Finally, it was irrelevant that consumers might now have to pay more for 10 Ltd.'s products assuming they had been oversubsidized in the past.</P></QUOTE>

<P>47. In <CASEREF><SOC>Nelson Consulting Services Ltd. v. R.</SOC></CASEREF>, a judgment of the Tax Court, the taxpayers made enquiries of agents of the Canada Revenue Agency as to how to file their taxes, and tried their best to comply with the Act, but still ended up with a $70,000 debt to the Minister for G.S.T. that they had failed to collect and remit. The Court, while sympathetic to the taxpayers, rightly concluded that bad advice from agents of the Minister could not relieve a taxpayer from the clear application of the law:
<QUOTE><P>5 Mr. and Mrs. Blinn, understandably, feel that they did everything that they could to comply with the law. This case certainly demonstrates the danger inherent in operating even a modest business in this country without the benefit of ongoing professional advice. I have no doubt that the Blinns had every intention of complying with the Act, and felt that they were being careful to do so. Unfortunately, their frequent inquiries of Revenue Canada are to no avail; <UNDER>I am bound by the decision of the Supreme Court of</UNDER> <UNDER>Canada in Inland Industries, which held that having relied upon bad advice from agents</UNDER> <UNDER>of the Minister cannot relieve a taxpayer from the application of the law</UNDER>. There is no ambiguity in the legislation; HST was exigible, and the Appellant failed to collect and remit it. The appeal must be dismissed.</P></QUOTE>

<P>48. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gemini Biochemical Research Ltd. v. R.</SOC></CASEREF>, a 1997 judgment of the Tax Court of Canada, the facts were almost identical to this case. The corporate taxpayer had been taken unawares by a change to the deadline for submission of materials related to a claim for a rebate of expenditures related to research. The taxpayer argued that, because the Guidelines for filing did not advert to the changed deadline, and because the Minister had not advised him of the change in the deadline, it ought not to be applied.</P>
<P>49. Justice Rowe responded to a taxpayer's arguments about the failure of the Guidelines to incorporate the new deadline as follows:
<QUOTE><P>They didn't have to. First of all, the very use of the word &ldquo;guideline&rdquo; is exactly indicative of what it is, it's a guideline. There's no requirement that your company be specifically put on a mailing list that Revenue Canada has to advise you when it's about to change the law and if you rely on waiting for changes in tax law to make its way into a guideline, you're going to do so at your peril, as was the case here, so there's no requirement in law that these kind of amendments&mdash;people are presumed to know and to keep abreast of this. The royal assent was, the Minister says, received on June 15th, 1994, and there was appropriate proclamation in the Canada Gazette. There must have been some information released by way of circular or a reference in the newspapers or Globe &amp; Mail or something, and the fact that it was not contained in the particular guideline is of absolutely no import or significance as a matter of law. If you've missed the deadline, you missed the deadline and I take it that you don't quarrel with the fact that the deadline for providing information regarding these expenditures was missed.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gemini Biochemical Research Ltd. v. R.</SOC><CITE>[1997] 3 C.T.C. 2664</CITE><PARANUM>6, 16</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>[Book of Authorities, Tab 12]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. In summary, the principle that neither Government Guidelines, nor poor advice by representatives of the Department, nor forms, nor any other kind of publication can serve to countermand a regulatory provision is well established in Canadian law.</P>
<P>51. So long as the provisions of the Act and Regulations have been properly applied, they will prevail over any advice given by agents of the Minister, as well as any written opinions, memos, or bulletins, notwithstanding that a taxpayer may have relied upon them in conducting their business.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Although the Appellant put in issue the entire judgment of Justice Mahar,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Amended Notice of Appeal</EM> (Appeal Book, March 20, 2015 (&ldquo;<BOLD>AB</BOLD>&rdquo;), Tab 8, Bates page F20).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the appeal raises only the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the context of the government decision at issue.</P>
<P>2. The Appellant does not challenge the test His Honour chose to consider the doctrine. It only challenges the <EM>application</EM> of this test, i.e. His Honour's findings and determinations as to whether the test is met. This is reviewable on the deference standard of a palpable and overriding error. The Appellant's assertion that the correctness standard applies in the circumstances of this Honorable Court's review and that the Respondent is in agreement with this standard<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Appellant's Factum</EM>, paras. 31-32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> is inaccurate.</P>
<P>3. The decision at issue is the Appellant's denial of a tax rebate to the Respondent under the Nunavut Fuel Tax Rebate program (&ldquo;<BOLD>Program</BOLD>&rdquo;). Justice Mahar overturned the decision. His Honour found that the denial of a portion of the rebate was inconsistent with the statute, and that the Appellant committed an error in failing to consider and properly apply the statutory law. In overturning the decision on this point, Justice Mahar interpreted the statutory law. <EM>None</EM> of this interpretation and His Honour's corresponding findings is challenged by the Appellant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Appellant's Factum</EM>, filed June 26, 2015, para. 29 (&ldquo;Grounds of Appeal&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. With respect to another portion of the rebate, Justice Mahar found that although it was not refundable under the statute, it was returnable to the Respondent in equity, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.</P>
<P>5. In challenging His Honour's application of the test, the Appellant rests its case on two arguments. It states that: (a) its actions did not constitute a promise on which the Respondent relied and acted upon; and, (b) His Honour's decision purports to trump an express statutory provision which it argues equity cannot displace.</P>
<P>6. With respect to point (a), Justice Mahar considered the applicable facts and found that the conduct of the parties satisfied the legal threshold, i.e. that the Appellant's actions constituted a promise and that the Respondent relied and acted upon this promise. The promise was found in numerous communications from the Appellant, on which the Respondent relied and based its tax rebate applications.</P>
<P>7. In relation to (b), His Honour, after considering the applicable law, expressly rejected that the statutory interpretation at issue played any role in the application of the doctrine in the circumstances of this case. He asked &ldquo;whether the Government acted fairly in applying the provisions of the statute&rdquo; towards the company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Reasons for Judgment</EM>, para. 75 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F15).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> His Honour's inquiry was proper. In reviewing the Appellant's actions under the test of estoppel, Justice Mahar concluded that the Appellant's actions were &ldquo;taxation by ambush&rdquo; and thus, unfair towards the Respondent. The fairness of the Appellant's actions is a factual inquiry, and is therefore reviewable on the deference standard by this Court.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>REBATE</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>APPLICATIONS</TI>
<P>8. The Respondent, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>AEM</BOLD>&rdquo;), submitted two applications for a fuel tax rebate to the Appellant on May 23, 2013. The applications were for the fuel that the Respondent purchased in June, July and October of 2012. The amount claimed in the applications represented the amount of taxes the Respondent claimed under the Nunavut Petroleum Product Tax Rebate program. The Respondent claimed the return of $1,465,263.42 in Application 1, and $494,576.05 in Application 2. The applications were for the purchases of 63,411,381 litres of fuel.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, paras. 21&ndash;23 and Exhibits D and E &ldquo;Applications&rdquo; (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 5, 33&ndash;66);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 1, 16&ndash;22 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F2, F5).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. The Respondent used approximately 2/3 of this fuel, 43,703,826 litres, in 2013. The balance, 19,707,555 litres, was used in 2012. All the purchased fuel at issue was consumed by the Respondent in Nunavut in the equipment and machinery that AEM used for its mining activities.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, paras. 30, 31, 33, 35&ndash;45 (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 6&ndash;8).</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 16&ndash;22 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F5).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>DENIAL</TI>
<P>10. The Appellant denied any tax rebate on the only ground that the Respondent missed the March 31 deadline found in section 8(4.1) of the <EM>Fuel Tax Rebate Regulations</EM>. The Appellant applied section 8(4.1) to the applications.
<P1><BOLD>Transcripts of Cross-Examination of D. Young (&ldquo;Transcripts&rdquo;), Q 73&ndash;89 pg 14&ndash;17&mdash;AB, Tab 5, Bates pages 143&ndash;146; Lessard Affidavit, para. 46 and Exhibit F (Letter to AEM from Daniel Young, July 12, 2013)&mdash;AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 8, 67&ndash;69;</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 23 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F5).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>JUSTICE MAHAR'S DECISION</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>FUEL USED IN 2013</TI>
<P>11. Justice Mahar found that the rebate was allowable for the fuel used by the Respondent in 2013. All of that fuel was used and claimed within a year of purchase, consistent with the applicable statutory limitation period.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 86 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Justice Mahar interpreted the law, and found that only section 8(4) applied to this fuel. Section 8(4.1) did not apply because this fuel was not used in the same calendar year it was purchased.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 86 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. In particular, His Honour interpreted the provisions at issue as follows:
<P1>a. For all Section 5 companies, all fuel must be used for a defined purpose and claimed within one year of being purchased or imported into Nunavut in order to qualify for a rebate pursuant to section 8(4).</P1>
<P1>b. For any &ldquo;eligible petroleum product&rdquo;, fuel <EM>used</EM> for such a defined purpose, must be claimed by March 31st following the calendar year of its purchase or import and use, pursuant to section 8(4.1).</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 88 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. In interpreting these provisions, Justice Mahar concluded that the <EM>use</EM> of petroleum was critical. The legislative language of purchase vs. use of petroleum in the interpretation of the sections was the parties' main controversial issue before His Honour.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 56-57, 61, 63, 64, 67 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F11&ndash;13).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The Appellant failed to consider the &ldquo;use&rdquo; component of the legislation, applied the law incorrectly, and therefore was wrong in denying the applications.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 63&ndash;67, 86 (Tab 7, AB, Bates pages F12-13, F18).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>FUEL USED IN 2012</TI>
<P>16. Justice Mahar found that the fuel used in 2012 was not refundable under the statute. However, given the facts of this case, His Honour concluded this fuel was refundable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 87, 89 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. In reaching this conclusion, His Honour considered the test for public law promissory estoppel.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 70, 71 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F13-14).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The Appellant relies on the same test in its submissions to this Court.
<P1><BOLD>Appellant's Factum, para. 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. In its submissions to this Honourable Court, the Appellant relies on the case law which His Honour considered and analyzed in applying the test to the facts of this matter.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 68&ndash;85 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F13&ndash;18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The Appellant's conduct in this case, in His Honour's view, was &ldquo;even more troubling&rdquo; as compared to the facts in the other case law. He concluded that the Appellant's conduct towards the Respondent amounted to &ldquo;taxation by ambush.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 78&ndash;84 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F16&ndash;18).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. In conclusion, His Honour recognized that the promissory estoppel &ldquo;will be a rare and unusual remedy in tax cases, highly unusual when dealing with a taxpayer failing to follow specific statutory requirements. However, in this particular case, on these unusual facts, it is made out. The combined effect of the misguiding Guidelines, the less than helpful forms, and a reasonable reliance on the ongoing relationship between AEM and the Government leads to what is, in effect, a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; that the regime was continuing as it had before.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 85 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F18).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>SECTION 8(4.1)</TI>
<P>22. Section 8(4.1) is a new section. It was introduced in 2012.
<P1><BOLD>Transcripts, Q 9-10 pg 4 (AB, Tab 5, Bates page 133);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 9,10 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F3-4).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Section 8(4.1) was passed within a few months, soon after it was introduced. It was passed without notice to or consultation with industry stakeholders or the Respondent. The lack of any consultation with the Respondent occurred despite the fact that the Respondent was the only company that would be affected by this section. There was nothing preventing the Appellant from consulting with the Respondent. In fact, the parties work together as part of a Development Partnership Agreement whereby the Respondent makes important contributions to the people of the territory. For this reason, the Respondent was shocked when it learned of the new deadline after March 31, 2013, and amazed that no one in the Appellant's team alerted it to such a significant change.
<P1><BOLD>Transcripts, Q 220&ndash;239 pg 38&ndash;41, Q 209&ndash;219 pg 36&ndash;38 (AB, Tab 5, Bates pages 165&ndash;170); Lessard Affidavit, paras. 16, 58-59, 4&ndash;13 (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 2&ndash;4, 10-11);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 5, 9&ndash;11, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F2&ndash;4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE APPELLANT</TI>
<P>24. In preparation of its applications over the years, the Respondent has relied on the Appellant's instructions and guidelines, including those published in 2006 and 2009 as further described below, which the Respondent considered official and authoritative sources, and used its best efforts and diligence to comply with them. In addition, on occasion the Respondent's personnel had telephone and email exchanges with the personnel in the Appellant's Department of Finance in order to obtain additional information and clarifications. The Respondent also relied on the information obtained through these exchanges.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 48 (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 8-9);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 5&ndash;8, 11&ndash;15 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F2&ndash;4).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. In none of these exchanges did the Appellant mention the new deadline. The Respondent did not submit the applications at issue on or before March 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2013, the Respondent was not aware of the March 31 deadline.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, paras. 47&ndash;67 (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 8&ndash;12);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 5&ndash;8, 11&ndash;15, 75, 78&ndash;80, 82&ndash;85, 89 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F2&ndash;4, F15&ndash;19).</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><TI>2006 GUIDELINES</TI>
<P>26. Pursuant to the 2006 Guidelines, the Respondent's applications for tax rebates on fuel purchases, with the exception of the applications pertaining to purchases in 2011 and 2012, were based on periods dating from April 1 to March 31, and were submitted prior to March 31 of the following year.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 49 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 9);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 8, 12&ndash;14, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>2009 GUIDELINES</TI>
<P>27. As concerns the preparation of the rebate applications for the 2012 fuel purchases, the Respondent relied on the Appellant's <EM>Fuel Tax Rebate for Mining Development, Extraction and Reclamation Guidelines</EM> (Revised July, 2009) (&ldquo;<BOLD>2009 Guidelines</BOLD>&rdquo;), which, in the Appellant's words, have &ldquo;been prepared to assist [the claimant] in understanding the Fuel Tax Rebate for mining development, extraction and reclamation.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 50 and Exhibit G (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 9, 71&ndash;73);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 8, 12&ndash;14, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. The 2009 Guidelines provided instructions that applicants were required to file two (2) applications per year, the first for the period of April to September, with the application to be filed no later than September 30 of the following year, and the second for the period from October to March with the applications to be filed no later than March 31 of the following year, with the overriding instruction that in any event, rebate applications had to be submitted within one (1) year of the fuel purchases.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 51 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 9);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, <EM>ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. Therefore, based on fuel purchase dates of June, July and October in 2012, the Respondent believed that it had until June 2013 to file the first of its rebate applications (i.e. the rebate application pertaining to the fuel purchased in June and July 2012) and that the rebate application for the fuel purchased in October 2012 would not be due until October 2013.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 52 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 9-10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, <EM>ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>RESPONDENT'S PRACTICE</TI>
<P>30. The Respondent relied on the 2006 Guidelines and the 2009 Guidelines published by the Appellant's Department of Finance for instructions as to rebate applications under the Program.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 53 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 12, 31, 71 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. During all the years that the Respondent filed tax rebate applications under the Program, including the two (2) applications at issue, it had not come across, in any of the guidelines issued by the Government's Department of Finance and available on the Internet, any reference to the deadline of March 31 for filing rebate claim forms for fuel purchased in or brought into Nunavut in the preceding year.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 54 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 8, 12&ndash;14, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>APPELLANT'S FORMS</TI>
<P>32. Furthermore, a deadline of March 31 for filing rebate claim forms for fuel purchased in or brought into Nunavut in the preceding year does not appear in the instructions contained on the Appellant-issued rebate application forms outlining the requirements pertaining to the completion and filing of the application forms.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 55 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, <EM>ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. In reference to the applications at issue, the Respondent was guided by the statement found in the application form providing that &ldquo;No rebate can be claimed on fuel which was purchased or brought into Nunavut longer than one year prior to the application being submitted&rdquo;, which makes no reference to March 31.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 56 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 15 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F4).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. The Respondent used the information in the Appellant's guidelines and the application forms to make its fuel tax rebate claims and relied on that information. There was nothing in any of those documents to indicate any change to the deadline for the submission of the fuel tax rebate applications, nor any information that would alert the Respondent that a new date had become applicable. The Respondent believed that there had not been any change to the applicable deadline.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 57 (AB, Tab 3, Bates page 10);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 8, 12&ndash;14, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. With respect to the Appellant's statements at paragraphs 27 and 28 of its factum that the applications at issue had referred to a consolidated version of the regulations, His Honour considered this fact and found it of no consequence.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, para. 10 (AB, Tab 7, Bates page F4).</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>2012 GUIDELINES</TI>
<P>36. After filing the applications at bar with the Appellant, the Respondent obtained a new version of the <EM>Fuel Tax Rebate for Mining Development, Extraction and Reclamation Guidelines</EM> updated by the Appellant as of May 2012.
<P1><BOLD>Lessard Affidavit, para. 60 and Exhibit H &ldquo;2012 Guidelines&rdquo; (AB, Tab 3, Bates pages 11, 75&ndash;79);</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, paras. 8, 12&ndash;15, 31 (AB, Tab 7, Bates pages F3-4, F7).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. With respect to deadlines, the May 2012 version requires that fuel purchase invoices be attached to the rebate application and that invoices submitted must not be older than one (1) year. This is exactly what the Respondent did. This 2012 version was not used by AEM in preparing its rebate application; however, it would have made no difference as the guidelines are no different than the previous guidelines with respect to its applications and do not indicate the new March 31 deadline that had been adopted by the Appellant in May 2012.

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, <EM>ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>NO REASON TO QUESTION APPELLANT'S MATERIALS</TI>
<P>38. Relying on the above stated material and following them in an effort to adhere to the filing requirements, the Respondent had no reason to disbelieve these or suspect they were in error, misleading or incomplete, or that the Respondent would be required to investigate on its own if there were any other requirements in addition or contrary to these instructions. Therefore, the Respondent did not search for any other sources to verify if there was any other information that would contradict the instructions issued by the Appellant's Department of Finance or indicate a major change in policy.

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Judgment, <EM>ibid.</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. Even if the Respondent were subject to the law specifying the March 31 deadline, it was not in a position to file an application by March 31, 2013 stating the use of the fuel in question purchased during the preceding year. It did not know the use of the 2012 fuel purchases until August 2013 when the fuel had been consumed. It was only then that it knew the use of the fuel and whether it fell within the definition of an &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; petroleum product in accordance with the amended regulation and its definition section.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II. GROUNDS OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>40. The Respondent submits that Justice Mahar made no error in reaching the conclusion that the Appellant's actions were an actionable and reliable promise to the Respondent, and that equity required the Government to hold onto its promise, which permitted the application of the rebate as a result.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III. POINTS OF LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL</TI>
<P>41. The test in public law of estoppel is fairness.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mount Sinai Hospital Center v. Quebec (Minister of Health and Social Services)</SOC><CITE>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 281</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;Respondent's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;BOA&rdquo;), Tab 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. Promissory estoppel is made where &ldquo;the other party has, by words or conduct, made a promise or assurance which was intended to affect their legal relationship and to be acted on. Furthermore, the representee must establish that, in reliance on the representation, he acted on it or in some way changed his position.&rdquo;

<P>43. The promise must be unambiguous but could be inferred from circumstances.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Maracle v. Travellers Indemnity Co. of Canada</SOC><CITE>[1991] 2 S.C.R. 50</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;Appellant's BOA, Tab 7;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Mount Sinai Hospital Center v.

<P>44. Under this doctrine, a party is held to act consistently with statements they made to another party where that party has acted upon or relied upon such statements to guide their actions. The principle of estoppel is binding on the Crown.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Langille</SOC><CITE>[1977] F.C.J. No. 46</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;Respondent's BOA, Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. Where promises made are consistent with the executives' statutory discretion, and are not contrary to the law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies. &ldquo;Protection of [entities] caught in the transition from a relaxed regime to a more strict regime&rdquo; is the key issue, and the main concern, in the judicial analysis of fairness / estoppel.

<P>46. The Appellant enjoys this discretion under the applicable legislation. Tax rebate applications are made to the Minister of Finance, who shall pay the claimed tax rebate to the applicant if the application meets all requirements of the Regulations. In assessing the applications, the Minister reviews if the application is supported, including by various documentation of the claimant. For a better determination of whether the eligibility requirements for a tax rebate have been made, it is in the Minister's discretion to request additional information in connection with the application.

<P>47. Justice Mahar fully considered this law in reaching his conclusions.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>STANDARD OF REVIEW</TI>
<P>48. Appeal courts are reluctant to interfere with findings of fact if there is evidence capable of supporting the decision and there is no palpable and overriding error.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Galaske v. O'Donnell</SOC><CITE>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 670</CITE><PAGENUM>at page 695</PAGENUM></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;Respondent's BOA, Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>49. The application of a legal standard to a set of facts is reviewed with deference, on the standard of palpable and overriding error.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235</CITE><PARANUM>27, 29, 36, 37</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>&mdash;Respondent's BOA, Tab 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. Consistent with the above, &ldquo;once the correct test for estoppel is chosen, determinations as to whether the test is met (whether there has been an unequivocal representation and detrimental reliance) are questions of fact on which the [trier of fact] will be given deference.&rdquo;
