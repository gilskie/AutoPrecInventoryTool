<P1>t) the Appellant earned net business income of $13,412 from the sale of the Property in the 2010 taxation year;</P1>
<P1>u) the Appellant did not report any business income from the sale of the Property in the 2010 taxation year;</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Penalties under 163(2) of the <EM>Act</EM></TI>
<P><P1>v) the unreported net business income from the sale of the property of $13,412 represents 15.93% of the Appellant's total reported income of $84,190 for the 2010 taxation year;</P1>
<P1>w) at no time did the Appellant or his Mother ever move into or ordinarily occupy the Property;</P1>
<P1>x) the Appellant signed his tax return attesting to the accuracy of the amounts reported. Therefore, the Appellant knew or ought to have known about the undisclosed business income from the sale of the Property;</P1>
<P1>y) in failing to report net business income in the amounts of $13,412 in the 2010 taxation year, the Appellant knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence in carrying out a duty or obligation imposed under the <EM>Act</EM>. made or participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of false statements or omissions in the income tax returns filed by him for the 2010 taxation year; and</P1>
<P1>z) as a consequence of the Appellant's failure to report net business income in the amount of $13,412 he incurred in the 2010 taxation year, the Appellant is liable for a penalty pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the <EM>Act</EM> in the amounts of $1,613 in the year.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P>10. The issues to be decided are whether:
<P1>a) the Minister properly reassessed the 2010 taxation year to include unreported net business income of $13,412 from the sale of the Property; and</P1>
<P1>b) whether the Appellant was properly assessed penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act in the 2010 taxation year.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON, AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>14. The Attorney General relies on sections 3, 4, 9, 38, 40, and 54, subsections 9(1), 10(1.01), 38(1), 39(1), 40(1), and 163(2), and paragraph 40(2)(b) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>15. As neither the Appellant or his Parents, moved into and ordinarily occupied the Property, the Property was not the Appellant's &ldquo;principal residence&rdquo; as defined by section 54 of the <EM>Act</EM>, therefore the Appellant was not eligible for the principal residence exemption pursuant to paragraph 40(2)(b) of the <EM>Act</EM></P>
<P>16. The Appellant did not hold the Property for investment purposes, on account of capital pursuant to subsection 38(1) and 40(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>17. As the Appellant engaged in the purchase of real property and subsequent disposal of the Property at the earliest opportunity for profit, the income earned was an adventure or concern in the nature of trade as meant by subsection 10(1.01), the Minister properly assessed the profit on the sale of the Property as business income pursuant to section 3, and subsection 9(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>18. The Minister properly imposed a penalty pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the <EM>Act</EM> since the Appellant in not reporting the income earned from the sale of the Property, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or omission in his income tax return for the 2010 taxation year.</P>
<P>19. The Attorney General requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">Part I&mdash;Facts</TI>
<P>1. The appellant Mr. Stephen Bygrave, appeals to the Court from a re-assessment, made under <EM>the Income Tax Act</EM>, dated December 18, 2014, of his 2010 T-General Income Tax Return.</P>
<P>2. In or around 1999 through 2010 the appellant lived with his brother, Patrick Bygrave, in a multi-story townhouse at the address municipally known as XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>3. In or around 2006, the appellant's brother advised the appellant that he wished to move out of the property, as he planned to many his girlfriend, and wished to have his own residence to start his family. The appellant's brother married in 2007. The appellant's brother continued to live in the house with his wife, and their child who was born in 2007, while they waited for their new home.</P>
<P>4. The appellant believed that, once his brother moved out, the property would be too big for the appellant to reside on his own.</P>
<P>5. In or about September 2006, with the intention of moving into a smaller property, where the appellant would live alone, the appellant purchased a pre-construction condominium at the address municipally known as XXXXXXXXXX. The appellant purchased this property with the intention of residing in the property and not for the purpose of flipping.</P>
<P>6. As well, the property at XXXXXXXXXX was closer to the appellant's place of work at the Toronto Transit Commission, and provided easier access to the city of Toronto.</P>
<P>7. The Appellant continued to live in his townhouse while the condominium was under construction. The closing date for the condominium was repeatedly pushed back due to construction delays. The closing ultimately took place almost 3 years later in November 2009.</P>
<P>8. In December 2008, a year before closing of his condominium, the appellant's, father, who lived on the island of Jamaica, passed away. Mr. Bygrave's father's death left his mother alone without any immediate family near her. Mr. Bygrave made the decision to have his mother move into his townhouse to live with him. Mr. Bygrave chose the townhouse because it provided a comfortable living space for two people. The condominium would be too small for two people.</P>
<P>9. Mr. Bygrave's mother moved into the townhouse in 2009, prior to the closing of the condominium.</P>
<P>10. The condominium was put up for sale immediately after Mr. Bygrave took possession. The condominium was never rented out, and no income was earned from the property. The property was sold for a profit of $13,412.00.</P>
<P>11. The condominium and the townhouse are the only properties that Mr. Bygrave has ever purchased.</P>
<P>12. The appellant did not purchase the condominium for the purpose of investment. The appellant purchased the condominium with the intention of making the condominium his principal residence. Once his father passed away, the appellant's plans changed, and he now required a larger space to accommodate both himself and his mother. The condominium was not suitable for this new purpose which arose as a result of the appellant's father's death.</P>
<P>13. The Appellant reported capital gains on the Condominium.</P>
<P>14. The Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) reassessed the Appellant for the 2010 taxation year by Notice of Reassessment dated and mailed to the Appellant on December 18, 2014</P>
<P>15. The Minister also assessed a penalty against the Appellant.</P>
<P>16. The Appellant objected in respect of the 2010 taxation year by Notice of objection received by the Minister on February 6, 2015.</P>
<P>17. The Minister confirmed the reassessments for the 2010 taxation year by Notice of Confirmation dated and mailed to the Appellant on January 12, 2016 pursuant to the said Notice of objection.</P>
<P>18. The appellant appeals to this court.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">Part II&mdash;Issues</TI>
<P>19. The issues on appeal are:
<P1>a. Should the profits on sale of the condominium be taxed as Business income or Capital Gains?</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">Part III&mdash;Law and Arguments</TI>
<P>20. The appellant states that the monies ought to have been characterized as capital gains.</P>
<P>21. The Income tax Act does not provide any criteria to distinguish a capital gain from business income from a commercial transaction. Each case is different, and the circumstances surrounding it must be reviewed to address the issue.</P>
<P>22. In his reasons in <CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2012 TCC 93 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF>, the Honourable Justice R&ea;al Favreau identified the factors the courts should take into consideration when attempting to determine when gains from the sale of real property are to be considered as business income or as a capital gain:</P>
<P><EM>A non-exhaustive list of those factors is provided in paragraph 3 of Interpretation a Bulletin IT-218R dated September 16, 1986</EM>:</P>
<P><EM>(a)</EM> <BOLD><EM>the taxpayer's intention with respect to the real estate at the time of its purchase</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(b)</EM> <BOLD><EM>feasibility of the taxpayer's intention</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(c)</EM> <BOLD><EM>geographical location and zoned use of the real estate acquired</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(d)</EM> <BOLD><EM>extent to which intention carried out by the taxpayer</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(e)</EM> <BOLD><EM>evidence that the taxpayer's intention changed after purchase of the real estate</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(j)</EM> <BOLD><EM>the nature of the business, profession, calling or trade of the taxpayer and associates</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(g) the extent to which borrowed money was used to finance the real estate acquisition and the terms of the financing, if any, arranged</EM>;</P>
<P><EM>(h)</EM> <BOLD><EM>the length of time throughout which the real estate was held by the taxpayer</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(i) the existence of persons other than the taxpayer who share interests in the real estate</EM>;</P>
<P><EM>(j) the nature of the occupation of the other persons referred to in (i) above as well as their stated intentions and courses of conduct</EM>;</P>
<P><EM>(k)</EM> <BOLD><EM>factors which motivated the sale of the real estate</EM>;</BOLD></P>
<P><EM>(l)</EM> <BOLD><EM>evidence that the taxpayer and/or associates had dealt extensively in real estate</EM></BOLD>.</P>
<P><EM>[23] None of those factors is conclusive in itself for the purpose of determining whether a gain from the sale of real estate constitutes business income or a capital gain. However, the most important factor is the taxpayer's subjective intention with respect to the property at the time the taxpayer acquired it (&ldquo;primary intention&rdquo;)</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>[24] To those factors must be added the &ldquo;secondary intention&rdquo; criterion, which was developed by the courts to take into account circumstances in which the taxpayer's &ldquo;primary intention&rdquo; to own the properly as an investment was thwarted and in which the taxpayer had the possibility of selling the property for a profit in the event that the taxpayer's investment project did not come to fruition</EM>.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>B&ea;langer v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2012 TCC 93 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>22&ndash;25</PARANUM></CASEREF></P>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The appellant's intention at the time of acquiring 8 Maison Parc Court</EM></TI>
<P>23. On the basis of the jurisprudence, the issue of whether an isolated transaction is in the nature of trade turns on the intention of the taxpayer at the time when he acquired the property.</P>
<P>24. The appellant intended to hold the property on a long-term basis.</P>
<P>25. The appellant's evidence is that at time he acquired the XXXXXXXXXX Court Property, his primary intention was to live alone in that property as his principal residence. This property was close to his place of work, and the property was smaller than the XXXXXXXXXX property and suitable for him to live in alone.</P>
<P>26. The appellant intended to sell the XXXXXXXXXX property, as his brother was moving out of the property and that the property would be too big for the appellant to reside in alone.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI>The feasibility/plausibility of the taxpayer's primary intention</TI>
<P>27. The appellant's primary intention is internally consistent and plausible. He was in a large two-story house in which he lived with his brother, his brother's wife and his brother's child. His brother and his brother's family intended to move out of the share house and into their own house. Within the year in which the appellant's brother notified the appellant of his intention, the appellant formed the conclusion that the house was too big for him to live in alone. The appellant then purchased a preconstruction condominium which was smaller than the house and closer to his place of work. The appellant intended to sell the house.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Geographical location and zoned use of the real estate acquired</EM></TI>
<P>28. The condominium was zoned residential.</P>
<P>29. The condominium was closer to the appellant's place of work.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(iv)</EM></N><TI><EM>Extent to which intention carried out by the taxpayer</EM></TI></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(v)</EM></N><TI><EM>The length of time throughout which the real estate was held by the taxpayer</EM></TI>
<P>30. The appellant purchased the property in 2006 and closed on the sale in 2009. The appellant did not reside in the property. For the months that the appellant had possession of the property he paid the mortgage, utilities and associated expenses without moving into the condominium or having anyone else live in the condominium.</P>
<P>31. At the first opportunity, the appellant listed the property for sale and accepted an offer for purchase.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(vi)</EM></N><TI><EM>The nature of the business, profession, calling or trade of the taxpayer and associates</EM></TI></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(vii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Evidence that the taxpayer and/or associates had dealt extensively in real estate</EM>.</TI>
<P>32. At the time the appellant resided at XXXXXXXXXX present, the was the employed by the TTC as a driver.</P>
<P>33. The appellant has never worked in the real estate or construction industry.</P>
<P>34. The appellant was not in the practice of purchase property for the purpose of flipping properties and making a quick profit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(viii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The appellant's secondary intention</EM></TI></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(ix)</EM></N><TI><EM>Evidence that the taxpayer's intention changed after purchase of the real estate</EM></TI>
<P>35. The appellant's primary intention was thwarted when his father died in late 2008. The appellant faced with his mother alone and feeling insecure in Jamaica offered to have her live with him. The fact is that the condominium, which was deliberately pur chased for one person, was too small for two people. As such, the appellant changed his intention and decided to stay in the house and sell the condominium.</P>
<P>36. The appellant changed his primary intention due to circumstances that were forced upon him by the death of his father and the appellant's mother moving in with the appellant.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Motivating factors in selling the property</EM></TI>
<P>37. The appellant's evidence is that he changed his plans because, with the death of his father, his mother was to live with him and the condominium was too small. Staying in the house made sense because it was big enough for the appellant and his mother.</P>
<P>38. The appellant's sole reason for selling the condominium was because it was now too small to suit his new living space goal which was to have a space large enough for the appellant and his mother to reside.</P>
<P>39. The appellant was not interested in renting out the condominium and becoming a landlord. As such, he had to sell the condominium.</P>
<P>40. For these reasons the appellant states that the Minister was not justified in recharacterizing the capital gain reported as business income for the 2010 taxation year.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Not appropriate to impose a penalty against the Appellant</TI>
<P>41. The appellant acted in good faith and is entitled to disagree with the minister with respect to the characterization of the proceeds of sale of the property. The appellant, in not reporting the income earned from the sale of the property, did not knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, make a false statement or omission in his income tax return for the 2010 taxation year.</P>
<P>42. The balance of evidence in this appeal, as previously described, does not show that the misrepresentation, as alleged by the Minister, is attributable to neglect, careless or willful default. Finally, the balance of evidence does not support the imposition of a penalty. See <CASEREF><SOC>Cameron v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2011 TCC 107 (CanLIl)</CITE><PARANUM>16&ndash;26</PARANUM></CASEREF>. <CASEREF><SOC>Cameron v.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">Part IV&mdash;Order Sought</TI>
<P>43. The Appellant seeks the following Order:
<P1>a. That his appeal be granted and the reassessment be vacated;</P1>
<P1>b. That the matter be sent back to the Minster to have the penalty removed.</P1>
<P1>c. Costs; and,</P1>
<P1>d. Such other Order as this Honourable Court deems just.</P1></P>

<P>It took me several months to locate the documents relating to this matter # some of which go back to 2006. I have now located enough documents to support my case. Also time was wasted in communication with the CRA#s Appeal Division. My Accountant, Nandlal Chartered Accountant (#NCA#) communicated with the Appeals Officer, Sandra Cahill to see if by providing the additional information she required can resolve this matter favourably for me. Ms. Cahill asked that the additional information be provided. However, after receipt of said information she called NCA and informed them that the file is closed and she could not do anything.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY TO AN APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME</TI>
<P>In reply to the Application for an Order extending the time within which the Applicant may file with the Tax Court of Canada a Notice of Appeal in respect of the 2010 taxation year, the Deputy Attorney General of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen says as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) reassessed the Applicant for the 2010 taxation year and the Notice of Reassessment was dated and mailed to the Applicant on December 18, 2014.</P>
<P>2. On February 6, 2015 the Applicant served on the Minister the Notice of Objection with respect to the reassessment for the 2010 taxation year.</P>
<P>3. The Minister notified the Applicant of her decision in respect of the objection by a letter dated January 12, 2016 confirming the reassessment for the 2010 taxation year. The letter further informed the Applicant that if he disagreed with the decision he may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada within 90 days from the date that the Notice of Confirmation is sent to him. In addition, information Form (RC4443-2) on how to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada was attached to the said letter.</P>
<P>4. The Applicant did not file the Notice of Appeal in respect of the 2010 taxation year with the Tax Court of Canada within the time limited by subsection 169(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>. The due date was April 11, 2016.</P>
<P>5. This Application for an extension of time within which to file a Notice of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada in respect of the 2010 taxation year was filed with this Honourable Court on June 2, 2016.</P>
<P>6. The Respondent submits that the Application should be dismissed for the following reasons:

<P>I, Rupinder Singh, of the City of Toronto in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am an Officer in the Toronto Litigation Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) and as such have charge of the appropriate records and knowledge of the practice of the Agency.</P>
<P>2. I have examined the records relating to the Application of Stephen Bygrave and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to.</P>
<P>3. An examination of the records shows that the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) reassessed the Applicant for the 2010 taxation year by Notice of Reassessment dated and mailed to the applicant on December 18, 2014.</P>
<P>4. An examination of the records shows that the Applicant objected in respect of the 2010 taxation year by Notice of Objection received by the Agency on February 6, 2015.</P>
<P>5. An examination of these records shows that the Minister confirmed the reassessments for the 2010 taxation year by Notice of Confirmation dated and mailed to the Applicant on January 12, 2016 pursuant to the said Notice of Objection. Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a true copy of the Notice of Confirmation dated January 12, 2016.</P>
<P>6. The ninetieth day following the day of mailing of the said Notice of Confirmation dated January 12, 2016 with respect to the 2010 taxation year was April 11, 2016.</P>
<P>7. After a careful examination and search of the records, I am unable to find that a Notice of Appeal was received on or before April 11, 2016, being the last day for filing a Notice of Appeal following the day of mailing of the aforesaid Notice of Confirmation dated January 12, 2016.</P>
<P>8. An examination of the Agency's records shows that the applicant filed an application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal for the 2010 taxation year with the Tax Court of Canada on June 2, 2016.</P>
<P>9. An examination of the records also shows that the Minister has not further reassessed the Applicant in respect of the 2010 taxation year.</P>
