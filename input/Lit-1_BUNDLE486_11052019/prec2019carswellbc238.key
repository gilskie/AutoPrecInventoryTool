<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>1. The case deals with the classic tension between, on the one hand, a vendor's disclosure obligations and, on the other hand, a purchaser's duty to do due diligence and the principle of <EM>caveat emptor</EM> or buyer beware.</P>
<P>2. The appellant vendor of residential real estate in Vancouver did not disclose to the respondent purchaser the fact of her son in law's murder on the front lawn of the subject property. The respondent purchaser learned of the the murder, which had occurred 2 years before the scheduled closing of the transaction and as a result of that discovery she refused to complete the transaction.</P>
<P>3. The learned trial judge determined that the fact of the murder was not a latent defect requiring disclosure by the vendor to the purchaser but he did conclude that the failure of the vendor to disclose the fact of the death to the purchaser in response to the question posed by the purchaser; &ldquo;why are you selling the property?&rdquo; constituted a fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
<P>4. The vendor's response to that question was truthful but incomplete.</P>
<P>5. The first substantive issue raised by this appeal deals with the question of whether a misrepresentation by omission can arise in circumstances where a subjective consideration (in this case the death of the son in law) is not disclosed by the representee to the representor. The appellant vendor says that it cannot.</P>
<P>6. The second substantive issue raised by this appeal, in the alternative, is whether the representation by omission, if found to be false and material, was made fraudulently or negligently. The appellant vendor says that it was made negligently and the respondent purchaser was not entitled to repudiate the contract but rather only pursue a remedy in damages.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>7. This case arises out of the collapsed 2009 sale of a residential property located at XXXXXXXXXX in the Shaughnessy neighbourhood of Vancouver. (the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;)</P>
<P>8. The facts of the case are unusual in that the respondent, Feng Yun Shao<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ms. Shao had her name legally changed to Amy Barsha Washington in 2011 but she was referred to as Ms. Shao throughout the trial.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;) repudiated the agreement by which she was to purchase the Property from the appellant, Mei Zhen Wang (the &ldquo;Vendor&rdquo;), after learning that a person had been fatally shot in front of the Property about two years prior to the transaction.</P>
<P>9. The person who was killed was the Vendor's son-in-law, Hong Chao (Raymond) Huang (&ldquo;Mr. Huang&rdquo;). Mr. Huang died on XXXXXXXXXX and his assailant remains unknown. Mr. Huang was married to one of the Vendor's daughters, Gui Ying (Winnie) Yuan (&ldquo;Ms. Yuan&rdquo;).
<P1>RFJ, paras 33, 25</P1></P>
<P>10. At the time of trial, the Purchaser was an 84-year-old resident of Guanzhou, China. She has not had any formal education in her lifetime. She speaks Cantonese and is able to write her name in Chinese characters, but is otherwise illiterate.
<P1>RFJ para. 16.</P1></P>
<P>11. For most of the time relevant to this case, the Vendor was in China and, due to that fact and her illiteracy, Ms. Yuan assisted her with the sale of the Property pursuant to a power of attorney.
<P1>RFJ, paras 16, 32, 43</P1></P>
<P>12. At the time of trial the Purchaser was 50 years old. The Purchaser was born and educated in China, where she obtained a Master's Degree in Economics Management. She is now a Canadian citizen. The Purchaser's first language is Mandarin. At the time of the transaction, she spoke little English.
<P1>RFJ paras. 26, 28.</P1></P>
<P>13. The Property was purchased on behalf of the Vendor in 2003. When the Property was purchased, Ms. Yuan, Mr. Huang, their two children, and Ms. Yuan's older sister all lived at the Property together. The Vendor and her husband later joined them in 2004. The Vendor and her husband then returned to China in 2007.
<P1>RFJ at para 19, 21</P1></P>
<P>14. On XXXXXXXXXX an unknown assailant shot Mr. Huang to death outside of the Property.
<P1>RFJ, para. 33</P1></P>
<P>15. In December, 2007 the Vendor's granddaughter, Samantha, was asked to leave her private school, West Point Grey Academy. Samantha transferred to a public school in the area, Lord Kitchener. Ms. Yuan wanted her daughter to attend a private school where she would have a better opportunity to learn and speak English than she did at Lord Kitchener, a school attended by many Chinese students. In February 2008, Samantha passed the entry examination for Collingwood, a private school located in West Vancouver. She was to start at Collingwood in September 2008.
<P1>RFJ, paras. 36, 37</P1></P>
<P>16. In April of 2008 and in anticipation of Samantha attending Collingwood School, Ms. Yuan purchased a condominium in West Vancouver so that she and her family could live close to her daughter's new school.
<P1>RFJ, para. 36</P1></P>
<P>17. Ms. Yuan and her family remained at the Property until the end of Samantha's school year at Lord Kitchener in June 2008, and lived there intermittently from the months of April until the end of June. In sum, Ms. Yuan and her family resided at the Property for approximately eight months following the death of Mr. Huang.
<P1>RFJ para. 40</P1></P>
<P>18. On June 30, 2008 the Property was first listed for sale with Raymond Leung. After December 30, 2008 it was taken off the market for several months. The Property was then listed for sale with Julia Lau and Matthew Yee of Sutton Group&mdash;West Coast Realty from June 15 to December 30, 2009.
<P1>RFJ, paras 44, 46</P1></P>
<P>19. Ms. Yuan and Ms. Lau met in early June 2009 to discuss listing the property. Ms. Yuan informed Ms. Lau that her husband had been killed on the street in front of the Property. Ms. Yuan asked Ms. Lau whether it was necessary to disclose the death of Mr. Huang to prospective purchasers. Ms. Lau told Ms. Yuan that she would have to speak with her manager about whether it was necessary to disclose Mr. Huang's death.
<P1>RFJ, para 100</P1></P>
<P>20. Ms. Lau, as the listing agent, worked with another realtor, Matthew Yee (&ldquo;Mr. Yee&rdquo;), who acted as the showing agent. Ms. Lau asked Mr. Yee to find out from their manager whether it was necessary to disclose the death of Mr. Huang to prospective purchasers. Mr. Yee made an inquiry of his manager by email and on June 30, 2009 he sent an email to Ms. Lau setting out his understanding of the advice he received from the manager.
<P1>RFJ, para 101, 102</P1></P>
<P>21. Mr. Yee was advised by his manager that unless a prospective purchaser specifically inquired about a death, he did not have to disclose Mr. Huang's death. Mr. Yee was also advised by the manager that he and Ms. Lau should not express any opinion to the Vendor about disclosure of the death, and that they should recommend that she obtain her own legal advice.
<P1>RFJ, para 106</P1></P>
<P>22. Ms. Lau told Ms. Yuan that her manager had advised her that she need not disclose the death of Mr. Huang unless a buyer or buyer's agent asked about deaths on or near the property. She recommended to Ms. Yuan that she seek legal advice regarding the disclosure of Mr. Huang's death to prospective purchasers. Ms. Yuan did not seek independent legal advice regarding disclosure of the death.
<P1>RFJ, para 107</P1>
<P1>Transcript of examination in chief of Chi Yuen Lau p 345, qs 35 to 41</P1></P>
<P>23. Ms. Lau testified that when she told Ms. Yuan that she would disclose the death only if a purchaser made a specific inquiry, Ms. Yuan agreed with her approach.
<P1>RFJ, para 109</P1></P>
<P>24. Ms. Yuan, the Vendor, Ms. Lau and Mr. Yee all gave evidence that neither the Vendor nor Ms. Yuan instructed the realtors not to disclose Mr. Huang's death.
<P1>RFJ, para 110</P1></P>
<P>25. Ms. Yuan told both Ms. Lau and Mr. Yee that she was selling the property because her daughter would be attending a school in West Vancouver. She did not mention any other reason for the sale.
<P1>RFJ, para 104</P1></P>
<P>26. The Vendor was present in Vancouver on June 15, 2009 when she signed the multiple listing contract and property disclosure statement with Ms. Lau. Otherwise Ms. Yuan handled all discussions with Ms. Lau regarding the listing. The learned trial judge determined that the Vendor did not instruct either Ms. Lau or Mr. Yee how to answer if a buyer asked why she was selling the property.
<P1>RFJ, para 47, 50</P1></P>
<P>27. In her examination for discovery, The Vendor acknowledged that, after the death of her son-in-law, she was concerned about the safety of her two daughters and her grandchildren, who continued to reside at the Property. The Vendor remained in Guangzhou, China and was not residing at the Property at or around the time of the death.
<P1>RFJ, para 53, 45, 21</P1></P>
<P>28. The learned trial judge found that the death of Mr. Huang was one of the reasons that the Vendor wished to sell the Property. Her other reasons for selling the Property were that she wished to make her permanent home in Guangzhou and that Ms. Yuan intended to move to West Vancouver to be near her daughter's new school.
<P1>RFJ, para 58</P1></P>
<P>29. The contract of purchase and sale at issue is dated September 3, 2009 (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;). Pursuant to the Contract, The Vendor agreed to sell and The Purchaser agreed to buy the Property for the sum of $6,138,000. The completion date of the Contract was November 17, 2009.
<P1>RFJ, para 60 AB, p 9</P1></P>
<P>30. The Contract was entered into nearly two years following the date of the death of Mr. Huang.</P>
<P>31. By September 25, 2009, the Purchaser had removed all of the conditions in the Contract that were for her benefit and had paid a deposit totalling $300,000 (the &ldquo;Deposit&rdquo;).
<P1>RFJ para. 126</P1></P>
<P>32. On September 30, 2009, the Purchaser learned through a friend, that a death had occurred at the front entrance to the Property. The Purchaser then asked her husband to do a Google search of the Property. He found and showed to her a newspaper article describing the fatal shooting of a person alleged to be a gangster in front of the Property. The Purchaser acknowledged that she knew nothing about Mr. Huang beyond what she read in the news report that her husband had found and translated to Mandarin for her, using the translation function on his computer. Following her discovery of the death, the Purchaser refused to complete the Contract on the basis that the death was not disclosed to her by the Vendor or her agents.
<P1>RFJ para. 127, 130</P1></P>
<P>33. The learned trial judge found that when the Purchaser &ldquo;learned of the unsolved murder of Raymond Huang in front of the Property, she feared for her own safety, and the safety of her family.&rdquo; The Purchaser's particular concern was that she &ldquo;feared that the unknown perpetrator might return and mistake her children for members of Mr. Huang's family.&rdquo;
<P1>RFJ, paras 131, 190</P1></P>
<P>34. The Purchaser purchased other multi-million dollar homes on the west side of Vancouver at around the same time the Contract was to complete in November, 2009. The Purchaser bought a property at XXXXXXXXXX, (the &ldquo;Marine Drive Property&rdquo;), which completed on November 17, 2009. This was the same date that the Purchaser was supposed to complete the purchase of the Property. The purchase price was approximately $6.88 or $6.9 million.
<P1>Transcript of cross-examination of Feng Yun Shao p 520, qs 46 to 47, p 521, qs 40 to 46</P1></P>
<P>35. The Purchaser also bought another property at XXXXXXXXXX, (the &ldquo;Angus Drive Property&rdquo;) for $5.8 million. The Purchaser entered into the contracts to buy the Marine Drive Property and the Angus Drive Property in October 2009. Both properties were registered around November 17, 2009.
<P1>Transcript of cross-examination of Feng Yun Shao p 522, qs 28&ndash;31, p 525, qs 26&ndash;41</P1></P>
<P>36. Following the collapse of the Contract, the Vendor ultimately sold the Property to another buyer for the price of $5,500,000 in February 2010. This action ensued.
<P1>RFJ, para 3</P1>
<P1>AB, p 28</P1></P>
<P>37. At trial the Vendor sought damages from the Purchaser in the amount of $638,000 representing the difference between the Contract price and the subsequent sale price to the other buyer.
<P1>RFJ, para 4</P1></P>
<P>38. The Purchaser defended and counterlaimed on the basis that she was entitled to repudiate the Contract because the death was not disclosed to her. The Purchaser submitted that the Vendor was under an obligation to disclose the death of Mr. Huang on two grounds: (1) the death was a material latent defect in the Property; and (2) the death ought to have been disclosed when the Purchaser's agent asked the Vendor's agent the only question she had at the time: Why was Ms. Wang selling the Property? The answer given by the Vendor's agent was that the Vendor's granddaughter was changing schools. The Purchaser submitted that by omitting the death as a reason for selling the Property, the Vendor made a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation.
<P1>RFJ, paras 5, 6</P1></P>
<P>39. Following a 14-day trial of this matter, the learned trial judge held that the Purchaser failed to establish that the Vendor was obliged to disclose the death of Mr. Huang as a latent defect.
<P1>RFJ para. 195.</P1></P>
<P>40. The learned trial judge concluded that the death of Mr. Huang was not a latent defect rendering the Property dangerous or uninhabitable and, accordingly, it was not a fact requiring disclosure by the Vendor. The death was not related to the physical or intrinsic qualities of the Property nor was it a defect or imperfection in respect of the Property or premises itself, or any measurable condition or quality of the Property.
<P1>RFJ paras. 191-192.</P1></P>
<P>41. The learned trial judge also concluded that even if the death was a defect, it was a patent, rather than a latent defect, which was capable of discovery by a purchaser making reasonable inquiries about the Property.
<P1>RFJ para. 194.</P1></P>
<P>42. However, with respect to the Purchaser's claim of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, the learned trial judge held that the Purchaser had established that she was induced to enter into the Contract by a fraudulent misrepresentation.
<P1>RFJ para. 221.</P1></P>
<P>43. The learned trial judge found that the Vendor made a false representation when she indicated, through her real estate agent, that her reason for selling the Property was that her granddaughter was changing schools, (the &ldquo;Representation&rdquo;) The learned trial judge found that this answer, while true on its face, was incomplete in that it concealed the fact that the granddaughter changed schools as an ultimate consequence of Mr. Huang's death, and that the death was a factor in the Vendor's decision to sell the Property.
<P1>RFJ paras. 202-203.</P1></P>
<P>44. The learned trial judge concluded that the death of Mr. Huang was a reason for selling the Property because the granddaughter would not have changed schools but for the murder of Mr. Huang.
<P1>RFJ, para. 208.</P1></P>
<P>45. In the result, the Purchaser's counterclaim was allowed and the Vendor's claim was dismissed. The Purchaser was granted rescission of the Contract and judgment for return of the Deposit, together with accrued interest, and consequential damages of $4,040.44.
<P1>RFJ, paras 221&ndash;226</P1></P>
<P>46. The Purchaser did not lead any evidence respecting damages, if any, that she would have suffered had she completed the Contract and pursued a remedy in damages.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ERRORS IN JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>47. The learned trial judge erred in concluding that by failing to disclose the death of Mr. Huang the Vendor had made a fraudulent misrepresentation which entitled the Purchaser to repudiate the Contract.</P>
<P><BOLD>48.</BOLD> In the alternative, if the death was material to the Purchaser's decision to enter into the Contract, the learned trial judge erred in finding that the representation was fraudulent rather than negligent.</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Duty to Disclose</EM></TI>
<P>50. The learned trial judge correctly concluded that the Vendor was not obliged to disclose the death of Mr. Huang as a latent defect.
<P1>RFJ, para 195</P1></P>
<P>51. The learned trial judge found that &ldquo;Raymond Huang's death was not a defect or imperfection in respect of the property itself, or any measureable condition or quality of the property&rdquo; and &ldquo;even if the death was a defect, it was a patent, rather than a latent defect, which the vendor was not obliged to disclose to the buyer. Mr. Huang's death was a matter capable of discovery by a purchaser making reasonable inquiries about the property.&rdquo;
<P1>RFJ, paras 192, 194</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</EM></TI>
<P>52. The test for fraudulent misrepresentation was correctly set out by the learned trial judge. In order to succeed in her claim the Purchaser was obliged to prove:
<P1>1) The Vendor's real estate agent made a representation of fact to the Purchaser regarding her reason for selling;</P1>
<P1>2) The representation made about the reason for selling was false in fact;</P1>
<P1>3) The vendor knew the representation was false when it was made;</P1>
<P1>4) The Vendor intended the Purchaser to act on the representation;</P1>
<P1>5) The Purchaser was induced to enter into contract in reliance upon the false representation and thereby suffered a detriment</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Callaway</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 189</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Van Beek v. Dodd</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1639</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF>; RFJ, para 196</P1></P>
<P>53. The standard of proof for fraudulent misrepresentation is assessed on a balance of probabilities, having due regard to the seriousness of the allegation of deceit. Fraud requires a high standard with evidence that is clear and convincing proof of the elements of fraud, including the mental element. The &ldquo;mental element&rdquo; of a fraudulent misrepresentation is the intent to deceive.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>a.</EM></N><TI>The Vendor's real estate agent made a representation of fact regarding the Vendor's reason for selling</TI>
<P>54. The learned trial judge found that Mr. Yee informed the Purchaser that the Vendor's reason for selling the Property was the granddaughter's change of school. The Vendor takes no issue with this.
<P1>RFJ, para 123</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>b.</EM></N><TI>The Vendor's representation regarding the reason for selling the Property was false in fact.</TI>
<P>55. The learned trial judge found that while the Representation was true on its face, it was a false representation because it was incomplete.</P>
<P>56. The Vendor accepts that if the disclosure of the death of Mr. Huang is a material fact that induced the Purchaser to enter the Contract, then the Representation was false in fact. The issue of the materiality of the Representation will be dealt with more fully later in this factum.</P>
<P>57. If this Court accepts the Vendor's later submission below that the Representation was not a material fact, then the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the Representation was &lsquo;calculated to conceal&rsquo; the death is legally irrelevant. The fact that the Representation did not fully encompass all of the Vendor's reasons for selling the Property is also irrelevant because there was no duty to disclose. The Purchaser did not ask and the Vendor did not say that the Representation reflected the only reason that the Vendor wished to sell the Property. It is respectfully submitted that in the absence of a duty to disclose or the determination that the Representation constituted a material fact, caveat emptor applies.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>c.</EM></N><TI>The Vendor knew the representation was false when it was made</TI>
<P>58. The learned trial judge found that Ms. Yuan knew that her daughter would not have changed schools but for the murder of Mr. Huang. Without question, the death of Mr. Huang was the first event leading to the granddaughter's change of schools. The change of schools was precipitated by the fact that the granddaughter had been required to withdraw from West Point Grey academy following the death of her father. Ms. Yuan and her family resided at the Property for 8 months until their move to West Vancouver to accommodate the granddaughter's new school.
<P1>RFJ, para 37, 40</P1>
<P1>Transcript of re-examination of Gui Ying Yuan, p 310</P1></P>
<P>59. As the Vendor truthfully disclosed that the reason for the sale of the Property was the granddaughter's change of schools, the imposition of a duty upon the Vendor to disclose all of the facts leading to the change of schools runs contrary to the well-established doctrine of <EM>caveat emptor</EM>. Absent a positive duty to disclose a fact or the determination that a fact is material to the contemplated transaction (in this case, the Contract), the obligation to engage in reasonable inquiry remains with the Purchaser.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>d.</EM></N><TI>The Vendor intended the Purchaser to act on the representation</TI>
<P>60. The learned trial judge found that Ms. Yuan informed the realtors of the Vendor's reason for selling; Ms. Yuan knew that the realtors would convey the representation to any prospective purchasers; and that Ms. Yuan intended that any purchasers would believe the truth of the statement.
<P1>RFJ, para 213</P1></P>
<P>61. The learned trial judge further concluded that the representation was &ldquo;calculated to conceal Mr. Huang's death as a reason for the plaintiff's decision to sell the property.&rdquo;
<P1>RFJ para 217</P1></P>
<P>62. It is submitted that that the learned trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in concluding that Ms. Yuan had the requisite intent to deceive, an essential element of a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.
<P1>RFJ, para 197</P1></P>
<P>63. Ms. Yuan disclosed to and sought advice from the Vendor's realtors concerning her duty to disclose Mr. Huang's death to prospective purchasers. She was advised by the realtors that she had no duty to disclose the death of Mr. Huang unless specifically asked about it. She was further advised to seek legal advice on the issue. She was told by the real estate agents that they would only disclose the death of Mr. Huang if asked about it. Ms. Yuan agreed with this approach. This evidence, which was uncontradicted and accepted by the learned trial judge, vitiates the conclusion that the Vendor had a clear intent to deceive, such that it would meet the high standard of proof for fraud.

<P>64. On the fifth and final element, the learned trial judge found that the Purchaser relied on the representation and was induced thereby to enter into the Contract. The learned trial judge concluded that the representation was material to the Purchaser in her decision to enter into the Contract and that &ldquo;materiality&rdquo; is a subjective consideration in the mind of the Purchaser.

<P>65. It is essential that a misrepresentation be &lsquo;material&rdquo; in its nature and constitute a fact essential to the decision to enter into the transaction. A misrepresentation will be &ldquo;material&rdquo;, if it influences and induces a party to enter a transaction and affects or goes to its very essence and substance.

<P>66. While the materiality of the Representation to the Purchaser's decision to enter into the Contract was viewed through the subjective lens of the Purchaser there remained, it is submitted, a concomitant duty upon the Purchaser to advise the Vendor of that subjectively determined material consideration.
<P1>RFJ, para 158</P1>

<P>67. Put simply, had the Purchaser advised the Vendor that it was important for her to know whether any resident of the Property had been involved in criminal activity or had been murdered at the Property and if the Vendor had then failed to disclose the death of Mr. Huang, this case would not be before the court. The failure to disclose the death would clearly have been a fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
<P>68. The learned trial judge was alive to the issue of the subjective factors that might influence a buyer of real estate. He found that other buyers might not have been concerned about the death of Mr. Huang. For those other buyers, the fact of the death of Mr. Huang would not have been a &ldquo;material&rdquo; consideration in their decision to make an offer to buy the Property.</P>
<P>69. In the context of the issue of latent defects the learned trial judge identified the impossible challenges that such a subjective obligation to disclose would impose upon Vendors. Such an obligation would render the doctrine of Caveat Emptor essentially meaningless.
<P1>RFJ at para 162, 193</P1></P>
<P>70. In the context of his fraudulent misrepresentation analysis however, it is respectfully submitted that the learned trial judge fell into error by imposing on the Vendor the obligation to determine the Purchaser's subjective view of the facts &ldquo;material&rdquo; to the decision to enter the Contract.</P>
<P>71. It is submitted that the obligation to disclose a subjective consideration as material must rest with the party for whom the subjective consideration is relevant. The Vendor has found no cases where a party has been found liable for a fraudulent misrepresentation by omission in circumstances where the innocent party did not ask a specific question to the representing party, <UNDER>regarding their subjective concerns</UNDER>.

<P>72. As stated by Fridman on the issue of the materiality of representation:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>(d)</N><TI>Intent that plaintiff should act</TI>
<P>The misrepresentation must be material. In other words, it must be as to something which was intended to induce the other party to enter into a contract. For example, if there is a misrepresentation as to the identity of a contracting party, it will not be effective, in the legal sense, even if false, unless it was known to the person making the misrepresentation that the identity of the party with whom he was contracting was important to the victim of the misrepresentation, and it was intended to influence what he did. ...</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE>

<P>73. The test for negligent misrepresentation is well established:
<P1>1) There must be a duty of care based on a &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; between the Vendor and the Purchaser;</P1>
<P1>2) The representation in question must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading;</P1>
<P1>3) The Vendor must have acted negligently in making said misrepresentation;</P1>
<P1>4) The Purchaser must have relied, in a reasonable manner, on said negligent misrepresentation; and</P1>
<P1>5) The reliance must have been detrimental to the Purchaser in the sense that damages resulted.</P1>

<P>76. In the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Ban v.

When completing the property disclosure form, the seller failed to make a connection between a question about the environmental condition of the property and two notices he had received regarding potential contamination of the property. The seller contended that he genuinely believed that he was answering the question truthfully and that he lacked the intention for the buyers to act on the representation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ban v. Keleher</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1132</CITE><PARANUM>24, 30</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>77. The court in <CASEREF><SOC>Ban v.

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>No Fraudulent Intent</EM></TI>
<P>78. If the learned trial judge was correct in his determination that the Representation was false by omission and that it was material to the decision of the Purchaser to enter into the Contract, the Vendor submits that the Representation was made negligently rather than fraudulently. It is submitted that the learned trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in his determination that the Vendor possessed a fraudulent intent to deceive.</P>
<P>79. As discussed in paragraph 53 of this factum, fraud requires a high standard of proof, particularly in regard to the mental element of intent to deceive.</P>
<P>80. It is submitted that the undisputed facts of this case, as found by the learned trial judge, vitiate any intent on the part of the Vendor to deceive the Purchaser.</P>
<P>81. Ms. Yuan did not actively seek to hide the fact of the death of Mr. Huang. Rather, she disclosed the fact of Mr. Huang's death to the Vendor's realtors and sought their advice concerning the circumstances in which she would be required to disclose the death.
<P1>RFJ at para 208</P1></P>
<P>82. Mr. Yee (the Vendor's showing realtor) sought the advice of his manager respecting this question. He communicated the answer to Ms. Lau (the Vendor's listing realtor) by an email of June 30, 2009. Ms. Lau then told Ms. Yuan that there was no duty to disclose the death of Mr. Huang to prospective purchasers but that Ms. Yuan should seek legal advice on the matter.
<P1>RFJ, para 101, 106, 108, 107</P1></P>
<P>83. Ms. Lau then told Ms. Yuan that she would disclose the death if a purchaser made a specific inquiry about a death at or near the Property. Ms. Yuan agreed with her approach.
<P1>RFJ, para 107, 109, 110</P1></P>
<P>84. Neither the Vendor nor Ms. Yuan instructed the realtors not to disclose Mr. Huang's death. They all understood that the death of Mr. Huang would be disclosed if a specific inquiry was made.
<P1>RFJ, para 110</P1></P>
<P>85. It is the case that Ms. Yuan did not seek legal advice despite the recommendation of the realtors. It is respectfully submitted, however, that having received the advice of the realtors that the death of Mr. Huang need not be disclosed, the Representation could not possibly have been made with fraudulent intent. At worst, the Representation was made negligently.
<P1>RFJ, para 107</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Damages as remedy</EM></TI>
<P>86. If the Vendor is liable for a negligent misrepresentation, the remedy therefore is damages. The Purchaser was not entitled to repudiate the Contract. She was obliged to complete the Contract and pursue her remedy in damages.</P>
<P>87. On the facts of the case at bar, despite pleading negligent misrepresentation the Purchaser led no evidence respecting the damages that she would have suffered as a consequence of the negligent misrepresentation. One might speculate that such damages would have included the transaction costs incurred in reselling the property. The Purchaser led no evidence on these damages nor did she prove that there would have been any diminution in value on a resale of the Property as a result of the negligent misrepresentation.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>A. This appeal is without merit. The trial judge instructed himself correctly in law, exercised his discretion judicially with respect to findings of credibility and made no palpable or overriding errors. The appellant has not demonstrated any reviewable error.</P>
<P>B. This case concerns the collapse sale of a luxury house in Vancouver. The Purchaser asked the Vendor why she wanted to sell her beautiful home in Shaughnessy and she replied that her granddaughter was changing schools to West Vancouver to better her English.</P>
<P>C. The Vendor omitted to tell the Purchaser that her granddaughter had been asked by West Point Grey Academy to leave the school following the killing of her father at the front gate of the Property. The &ldquo;murder&rdquo; remains unsolved to this day.</P>
<P>D. The appellant says that this case is about the tension between the doctrine of <EM>caveat emptor</EM> and the duty of a vendor's disclosure obligations. It is not. The doctrine is inapplicable in face of misrepresentation.</P>
<P>E. Relying on the half-truth of the Vendor and ignorant of that which she had concealed as to the reason why she was selling her house in Shaughnessy, the Purchaser agreed to buy it. When she discovered the truth, she refused to complete the sale.</P>
<P>F. The trial judge found that the Vendor's concealment of the killing and true reason for the child's change of schools made her representation about why she wanted to sell, a deliberate deceitful statement intended to induce the Purchaser to buy the Property.</P>
<P>G. The trial judge found that the respondent (plaintiff by counterclaim) proved on a balance of probabilities the requisite elements of fraudulent misrepresentation, granting rescission and damages for the cost of legal advice. He did not entertain negligent misrepresentation, although pleaded.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Background</TI>
<P>1. The respondent does not take issue with the appellant's statement of facts but wishes to state its own version of the relevant facts with references to testimony contained in the transcript.</P>
<P>2. In 2003 the appellant's daughter Gui Ying Yuan (&ldquo;Winnie&rdquo;), a Canadian citizen acting on behalf of her mother, purchased a residence at XXXXXXXXXX in the Shaughnessy neighbourhood of the City of Vancouver, British Columbia for $3,700,000. Title of the Property was transferred to her mother after she immigrated to Canada in 2004.
<P1>RFJ paras. 17&ndash;20</P1></P>
<P>3. In 2007 the appellant returned permanently to China, leaving power of attorney with Winnie. Following her return to China, Winnie's husband Mr. Raymond Huang, an alleged member of a criminal organisation known as the Big Circle Boys was shot to death at the front gate of the Property on XXXXXXXXXX. The killing remains unsolved.
<P1>RFJ paras. 21, 33, 35, 41</P1></P>
<P>4. Following Mr. Huang's death, his daughter was asked to leave West Point Grey Academy, the private school she was attending. She moved to a public school in Vancouver, and then to a private school in West Vancouver.
<P1>RFJ para. 37</P1></P>
<P>5. In 2008 the Vendor decided to sell the Property. On June 30, 2008, Winnie listed the Property with Mr. Raymond Leung, the realtor who had sold it to her mother. Mr. Leung, a discredited witness, testified that Mr. Raymond Huang signed the offer to purchase the Property in 2003.
<P1>RFJ para. 44 T, page 478 l. 31 to l. 36, page 479 l. 39 to l. 42</P1></P>
<P>6. The Property did not sell in 2008. After the listing expired, the Vendor waited six months and then on June 15, 2009, re-listed the Property for sale with another realtor, Julia Lau who worked with a partner, Matthew Yee. On August 4, 2009, the listing price was reduced from $7,690.0 00 to $6,980.000.

<P>41. The judge rejected Mrs. Wang's testimony at trial as to why she sold the Property.

<P>A. Did the respondent (plaintiff by counterclaim) prove on a balance of probabilities the requisite elements of fraudulent misrepresentation?</P>
<P>B. When does a half-truth constitute fraudulent misrepresentation?</P>
<P>C. Did the misrepresentation and omission constitute negligent rather than fraudulent misrepresentation?</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Did the respondent prove on a balance of probabilities the constituent elements of fraudulent misrepresentation?</TI>
<P>64. The central issue, in this case, is whether the Vendor's concealment from the Purchaser of the unsolved killing of her son-in-law in 2007 at the front gate of the Property constituted fraudulent misrepresentation entitling the Purchaser to rescission and damages for legal advice.</P>
<P>65. The appellant says that this case is about the tension between the doctrine of <EM>caveat emptor</EM> and the duty of a vendor's disclosure obligations. It is not. The doctrine is inapplicable in face of misrepresentation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McCluskie v. Reynolds</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 5384</CITE><COURTJUR>BC SC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1998] 65 B.C.L.R. (3d) 191</CITE><PARANUM>46-47</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, (Bennett J., as she then was).</P1></P>
<P>66. For example, this exception to the doctrine was applied in <CASEREF><SOC>Aldred v. Colbeck</SOC></CASEREF>, where the seller failed to disclose to the buyer the presence of an underground storage tank.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aldred v. Colbeck</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 57 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2010 BCSC 57</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>67. The appellant concedes that the trial judge correctly instructed himself on the test for fraudulent misrepresentation. The trial judge stated at paragraph 196:
<QUOTE><P>In order to succeed on a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation the defendant must establish the following elements:
<P1>1) the vendor made a representation of fact to the purchaser;</P1>
<P1>2) the representation was false in fact;</P1>
<P1>3) the vendor knew the representation was false when it was made, or made the false representation recklessly, not knowing if it was true or false;</P1>
<P1>4) the vendor intended the purchaser to act on the representation;</P1>
<P1>5) the purchaser was induced to enter into contract in reliance upon the false representation and thereby suffered a detriment.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>See <CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Callaway</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 189</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>; and <CASEREF><SOC>Van Beek v. Dodd</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1639</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>RFJ para. 196, Appellant's factum, para. 52</P1></P>
<P>68. The trial judge then carefully applied the requisite elements of fraudulent misrepresentation to the facts.
<P1>RFJ paras. 202&ndash;212</P1></P>
<P>69. The trial judge made adverse findings of credibility against the Vendor and her daughter Winnie about being less than candid about the circumstances of the killing of Mr. Huang and the reasons for selling the Property.
<P1>RFJ paras. 209 to 211</P1></P>
<P>70. The appellant contends that the standard of proof for fraud requires a,
<QUOTE><P>...high standard with evidence that is clear and convincing proof of the elements of fraud, including the mental element.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appellant's factum, para. 53</P1></P>
<P>71. There is only one standard of proof in a civil case, proof on a balance of probabilities. There are no degrees of probability within the civil standard.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK5><TI>First</TI>
<P>73. With respect to the first element, the judge found that when asked, the Vendor through her realtors made incomplete statements about the reason for selling the Property, concealing the fact that the granddaughter was asked to leave her school as a result of the shooting of her father and that the death was a factor in deciding to sell the Property.
<P1>RFJ, paras. 202, 203</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI>Second</TI>
<P>74. On the second element, the judge found that the Purchaser established on a balance of probabilities, that the representation by the Vendor's realtors as to the reason for selling the Property was a false representation by omission, citing Fenlon J., as she then was, in <CASEREF><SOC>Battrum v MacKenzie Estate</SOC><CITE>2010, BCSC 1285</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>, quoting S.M.

<P>75. For the third element, the trial judge found that the Vendor had no intention of disclosing the killing of Mr. Huang unless obliged to do so. The judge found that Winnie knew that the representation was untrue because she acknowledged that her child would not have changed schools to West Vancouver but for the killing of her husband [208]. Additionally, the judge had difficulty giving credit to Winnie's evidence in her interrogatories that her husband had died by accident [209] or not remembering whether she discussed the shooting with Mr. Leung or whether she told him that the killing was the reason for selling [210].
<P1>RFJ paras. 207&ndash;211</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI>Fourth</TI>
<P>76. As to the fourth element, requiring the Purchaser to establish that the Vendor intended her to act on the false representation, the trial judge found that the Vendor's daughter, Winnie,
<QUOTE><P>...intended that any prospective purchaser who made the inquiry would believe the truth of the statement, and would accept that the vendor had no other reason for selling the Property.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>RFJ para. 213</P1></P>
<P>77. A finding of intent to deceive is a finding of fact.

<P>78. <EM>CRF</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> is instructive. On appeal, Craig J.A. accepted the facts as set out at trial by Taylor. J., as he then was. This court upheld the trial judgment finding a vendor liable for fraudulent misrepresentation for concealing the truth about waste on his property. The vendor told the purchaser that waste slag would make &ldquo;excellent fill&rdquo; while concealing that it was radioactive.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>C.R.F. Holdings Ltd. v. Fundy Chemical International Limited</SOC><CITE>1980 CanLII 586</CITE><COURTJUR>BCSC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><YEAR>1980-81</YEAR><CITE>14 C.C.L.T. 87</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>79. In <EM>CRF</EM>, the trial judge held that when the purchaser inquired about the waste slag, the vendor was bound to reveal that it was radioactive, a fact the vendor concealed from the purchaser. The concealment, Taylor J. found, was calculated to deceive the purchaser, and it did. The case is apposite to the case at bar.
<P1><EM>CRF</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 4</P1></P>
<P>80. The appellant argues at para. 57 of its factum that the Purchaser was obliged to ask if the change of schools by the Vendor's granddaughter was the only reason for selling the Property. The trial judge correctly ruled that once the Purchaser asked the general question, she was entitled to an accurate, complete answer, not one that concealed the truth. The Purchaser was not required to ask anything further.
<P1>RFJ para. 217</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI>Fifth</TI>
<P>81. Finally, the fifth element, the Purchaser must prove that the Vendor's false representation induced her to enter into the Contract to purchase the Property and that she acted on the false representation.</P>
<P>82. On this requirement, the judge once again referred to Fenlon J. in <EM>Battrum</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, and this court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Sidhu Estate v. Bains</SOC></CASEREF>,
<QUOTE><P>[214] Finally, to maintain her counterclaim for deceit, Ms. Shao, must establish that the plaintiff's false representation induced her to enter into the contract. In Battrum, Fenlon J. stated the test for this element at paras. 24 to 25:</P>
<P>24 The test of materiality of the representation and reliance on it is a subjective one; it is not a matter of asking whether a reasonable person would have relied on the representation, but whether this plaintiff relied upon it in the circumstances of this case.</P>
<P>25 Battrum was induced to enter into the investment in AOI by a number of factors. It is likely that the opportunity to make a large and quick profit was a greater inducement than the security afforded by the units held in trust, but the law does not require the misrepresentation to be the only or even the most significant reason for the plaintiff's action. As stated in George Spencer Bower, The Law of Actionable Misrepresentation, 3d ed. (London: Butterworths, 1974) at 139:</P>
<P>120 It is sufficient to prove that the representation was an inducing cause. It is not necessary to establish that it was the inducing cause. Whether, if a full disclosure of the truth had been made, the representee would or would not have altered his position in the manner in which he did, is a question to which the law does not require an answer. It is enough if a full and exact revelation of the material facts might have prevented him from doing so&mdash;if it would have &ldquo;given him pause&rdquo;. [Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>In <CASEREF><SOC>Sidhu Estate v. Bains</SOC><CITE>[1996] 10 W.W.R. 590</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>25 B.C.L.R. (3d) 41</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Finch J.A. (as he then was) stated the following at para. 36 (cited to W.W.R.):
<QUOTE><P>It is therefore sufficient in my view to found liability in deceit if the fraudulent representation is a material inducement upon which the representee relied, even if that representation is only one of several factors contributing to her decision.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>RFJ, para. 214</P1></P>
<P>83. On this point, the appellant argues at paragraphs 59 and 71 of its factum that the Purchaser was obliged to ask the Vendor a specific question about whether there had been any criminal activity on the Property. There is no such duty on a purchaser to a vendor who conceals information. As stated by James LJ in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Arnold</SOC><YEAR>1880</YEAR><CITE>14 Chd 270</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 281</PAGENUM><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>,
<QUOTE><P>If a man makes a description calculated to mislead, I do not think that is well for him to say, if you had been very careful you would have found out the blunder.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Spencer Bower &amp; Handley, Actionable Misrepresentation</EM>, Fifth edition, 2014, LexisNexis page 125, footnote 8</P1></P>
<P>84. As the learned authors, <EM>supra</EM>, state at page 124,
<QUOTE><P>The representee has no duty to be careful, suspicious or diligent in research when the misrepresentation was intended to put his mind at rest.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>85. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the Purchaser that along with other factors, she relied on the Vendor's (mis)representation regarding the reason for selling the Property.
<P1>RFJ para. 215</P1></P>
<P>86. Once the Purchaser established that the misrepresentation might reasonably lead to her claimed loss, the onus shifted to the Vendor to prove that the misrepresentation was not in fact relied on. The question of onus was at issue in <EM>Shidhu</EM> where Mr. Justice Finch, as he then was, stated,
<QUOTE><P>I think the preferred view of the law in Canada is that once intention, materiality and causation of loss are proven, the burden of proving non-reliance shifts to the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sidhu Estate v. Bains</SOC><CITE>1996 CanLII 3332</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>77 BCAC 116</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>87. The Vendor failed to discharge its onus of proving non-reliance.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Materiality</UNDER></TI>
<P>88. The appellant argues that the killing is not a material fact, therefore there was no obligation on the Vendor to disclose it. The appellant argues that the trial judge fell into error by,
<QUOTE><P>..imposing on the vendor the obligation to determine the purchaser's subjective view of the facts &ldquo;material&rdquo; to the decision to enter the Contract.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appellant's factum, para. 70</P1></P>
<P>89. The trial judge did not impose any such obligation on the appellant. Materiality is defined by the learned authors of <EM>Spencer Bower</EM> as,
<QUOTE><P>A representation is material when its tendency, or its natural and probable result, is to induce the representee to alter his position as he did. This is a question of fact.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Spencer Bower &amp; Handley</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, page 80</P1></P>
<P>90. Unlike insurance law, objective materiality is not required as an essential element of deceit. The learned authors point out that the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> edition of Bullen and Leake of 1881 does not contain any allegations of materiality in the pleading at a time when deficient pleading was fatal to an action. The view that materiality is an essential element in a cause of action for deceit has been rejected in Australia.
<P1><EM>Spence Bower</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, pp. 84-85</P1></P>
<P>91. In fraudulent misrepresentation, the representor defines the relevant facts. Materiality depends on the impact of the representation. If the representation induces, then its material, if it does not, it is not material. Materiality is,
<QUOTE><P>...simply persuasive evidence of intent to induce and actual inducement.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Spence Bower</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, p. 85, footnote 9, RFJ, paras. 214, 217</P1></P>
<P>92. Here the trial judge found that the Vendor intended that any prospective purchaser would believe and act on the half-truth, namely that the Vendor had no other reason to sell the Property.
<P1>RFJ para. 213</P1></P>
<P>93. The judge found that the half-truth induced the Purchaser to enter into the Contract. The judge correctly instructed himself that the representation does not have to be the only reason, or even the most significant reason, citing <EM>Battrum</EM> and <EM>Sidhu</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>. The judge found that the Purchaser relied on the Vendor's representation regarding the reason for selling the Property.
<P1>RFJ paras. 216, 217</P1></P>
<P>94. The trial judge found that the representation induced the Purchaser to buy the Property, hence it was material. The appellant has not shown that the trial judge made any palpable or overriding error.</P>
<P>95. The trial judge must have reasoned that the omission about the killing might have reasonably deterred, or tended to deter the respondent from purchasing the Property. The judge drew a proper inference of fact in the circumstances of the case.
<P1>RFJ para. 217</P1>
<P1><EM>Spence Bower</EM>, p. 86. footnote 9</P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>When does a half-truth constitute fraudulent misrepresentation?</TI>
<P>96. A half-truth may be a misrepresentation. There are many cases in Canada and England where it has been held that half-truths can amount to deceit. Taylor J. in <EM>CRF</EM> cited often quoted passages:
<QUOTE><P>16 The law with respect to deceit by half-truth has its foundation in the colourful dictum of Chamber, J., in <CASEREF><SOC>Trapp v. Lee</SOC><YEAR>1603</YEAR><CITE>127 E.R.</CITE></CASEREF> (at page 203) (sic <CASEREF><SOC>Tapp v Lee</SOC><CITE>1803 3 Bos &amp; P 367</CITE></CASEREF>):
<ITEM><P>An action on the case for deceit is an action well known to the law, and I cannot agree in the argument which has been used for the defendant, that such actions ought to be confined to representations which are literally false. Fraud may consist as well in the suppression of what is true, as in the representation of what is false. If a man, professing to answer a question, select those facts only which are likely to give a credit to the person of whom he speaks and keep back the rest, he is a more artful knave than he who tells a direct falsehood.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>In <CASEREF><SOC>Peek v. Gurney</SOC><YEAR>1673</YEAR><CITE>(sic 1873) L.R. 6 H.L. 377</CITE></CASEREF>, Lord Chelmsford observes (at pages 291-2) that while mere concealment will not suffice to give rise to a right of action in deceit, so that there must be &ldquo;something actively done to deceive [the other party] and draw him in to deal with the person withholding the truth from him&rdquo;, this may well be accomplished by a half-truth. He observes that half a truth will sometimes amount to a &ldquo;real falsehood&rdquo;, and may contain &ldquo;a positive misrepresentation&rdquo;. The law is summarized in Spencer-Bower and Turner on Actionable Misrepresentations (Third Edition at page 94) in this passage:
<ITEM><P>To state a thing which is true only with qualifications or additions is known to, but studiously with-held by, the representor is to say the thing which is not. Such a statement is a lie, and one of the most dangerous and insidious forms of lie.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>While it is true that in Canada the concept of fraudulent concealment by silence alone has not gained the acceptance which it has found in the United States law governing sale of land, <UNDER>the concept of deceit by incomplete disclosure which is here recognized may impose very similar obligations on a vendor who answers a prospective purchaser's questions.</UNDER></P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>CRF</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, (trial), at para. 16 (underlining added)</P1></P>
<P>97. In <EM>CRF</EM>, on appeal, Anderson J.A. (dissenting in part with respect to damages) referred to the following cases:
<QUOTE><P>51 In addition to the authorities referred to by the trial judge, I would make reference to several cases where it has been held that to knowingly represent only favourable aspects without disclosing the fact that those favourable aspects are substantially qualified by restrictions and unfavourable aspects, known to the person making the representation, amounts to fraud.</P>
<P>52 Firstly, I make reference to the judgment of Denning L. J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Curtis v. Chemical &amp; Dyeing Co.</SOC><CITE>[1951] 1 K.B. 805</CITE><PAGENUM>at 808-9</PAGENUM></CASEREF> as follows:
<ITEM><P>In my opinion any behaviour, by words or conduct, is sufficient to be a misrepresentation if it is such as to mislead the other party about the existence or extent of the exemption. If it conveys a false impression, that is enough. If the false impression is created knowingly, it is a fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is created unwittingly, it is an innocent misrepresentation; but either is sufficient to disentitle the creator of it to the benefit of the exemption.di In <CASEREF><SOC>Rex v. Kylsant</SOC></CASEREF> (Lord) it was held that a representation might be literally true but practically false, not because of what it said, but because of what it left unsaid; in short, because of what it implied.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>See also the judgment of Avory J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Rex v. Kylsant</SOC><CITE>[1932] 1 K.B. 442</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>53 In that case, the following comments were made:
<P1>(a) Sometimes a half-truth is no better than a downright falsehood. (p.446)...</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>CRF</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, BCCA, paras. 51&ndash;53</P1></P>
<P>98. The answer to the Purchaser's question, that the reason for selling the Property was because Winnie's daughter was changing schools to better her English, was false and misleading. The answer given by the Vendor assured the Purchaser and dispelled any need to ask further questions. The truth lay in the omission. Even silence may be actionable.
<P1><EM>Sidhu</EM>, supra, paras. 31, 32</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Did the misrepresentation and omission constitute negligent rather than fraudulent misrepresentation?</TI>
<P>99. The appellant argues at paragraph 78 of its factum that the trial judge,
<QUOTE><P>...made a palpable and overriding error in his determination that the Vendor possessed a fraudulent intent to deceive.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>100. The trial judge's finding of intent to deceive is a finding of fact. The trial judge observed the witnesses at trial and made findings of credibility which support his decision on intent. Findings of credibility are delicate matters best left undisturbed by appellate courts.
<P1>RFJ paras. 10&ndash;15, 209 to 211</P1></P>
<P>101. In the seminal case on appellate standard of review, <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court once again stated that trial judges are in the best position to assess credibility,
<QUOTE><P>... We take the above comments of McLachlin J. to mean that, although the same high standard of deference applies to the entire range of factual determinations made by the trial judge, where a factual finding is grounded in an assessment of credibility of a witness, the overwhelming advantage of the trial judge in this area must be acknowledged. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>102. The appellant in this case carefully planned her answer to the potential question about why she was selling the Property and how she would conceal the shooting. She acted with forethought and deliberation.
<P1>RFJ, paras. 100, 209, T, p. 345, ll. 35&ndash;41, p. 110. ll. 5&ndash;41, p. 111, ll. 19&ndash;31, p. 228, ll. 5&ndash;7, p. 235, ll. 2&ndash;4</P1></P>
<P>103. The appellant chose not to seek legal advice on the issue, at her own peril. She denied in cross-examination that her realtors advised her to do so. The judge did not believe her on this issue.
<P1>RFJ, p. 107, and T, p. 112, ll. 11&ndash;31</P1></P>
<P>104. The appellant did not answer the Purchaser's question truthfully. She was not careless in her answer. Her answer was not an innocent mistake. She did not hold an honest belief that it was true. These are all elements of negligent misrepresentation which are lacking in this case.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Queen v. Cognos Inc.</SOC><CITE>1993 CanLII 146</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1993] 1 S.C.R. 87</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>105. Secrecy is the badge of fraud. The appellant concealed the true reason for why she was selling the Property. The trial judge had evidence on which to make his finding of fraudulent intent, a finding of fact. The judge did not commit any error in law or make any findings of fact that can be said to be plainly wrong. The judge did not make any palpable or overriding error in finding intent of deceit on part of the appellant.</P>
<P>106. The trial judge did not consider negligent misrepresentation as it was obviated by the finding of deceit.</P>
<P>107. It is incumbent on the appellant to demonstrate an error on the part of the trial judge. It has not done so.

<P>3. I am informed by Mr. Wong that examination for discovery of the Appellant was conducted in Macao, China, because she was unwilling or unable to come to Vancouver, B.C. to be examined.</P>
<P>4. I am further informed that the Appellant did not attend the trial in person. Instead, she appeared by video conference because she was unwilling or unable to come to Vancouver, B.C.</P>

<P>6. I am informed by Mr. Wong that the Bill of Costs for the appeal of this matter, a copy of which is attached to this Affidavit as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;,</BOLD> is a reasonable estimate of the taxable costs and disbursements to which the Respondent will be entitled if she is successful on this appeal. I believe <BOLD><UNDER>$10,740.00</UNDER></BOLD> is a reasonable estimate of the amount that will be assessed against the Appellant as costs if the Respondent is successful on this appeal.</P>
<P>7. The Appellant was ordered to pay costs to be assessed as ordinary costs at scale B for 13 days and reasonable disbursements.

I have thoroughly reviewed our file, including all emails and correspondence, and I am advised by Quang T. Duong, counsel for the appellant at trial that contrary to the facts alleged in paragraph 5 of Cherie Lam's affidavit, at no time prior to service of this motion has there been a demand for trial costs made by the respondent or her counsel. Prior to January 16, 2019 the appellant had not received a bill of trial costs from the respondent.</P>
<P>3. The estimated bill of costs for the trial, attached as Exhibit &lsquo;B&rsquo; to Ms. Cherie Lam's Affidavit, has not been assessed in the trial court. The respondent has not made an application nor taken any steps to assess the trial costs.</P>
<P>4. The appellant has already incurred nearly all of the costs required to prepare the case for appeal, including costs of preparing the appeal books, transcripts and factum. All that remains to be expended are the costs in relation to the hearing of the appeal, now scheduled for March 7, 2019.</P>
<P>5. The appellant, Mrs. Wang, is aged 84 and resides in China. I am advised by Mr. Duong that due to health reasons, Mrs. Wang could not travel to Vancouver for examinations for discovery or for trial. I am further advised by Mr. Duong that Mrs. Wang is illiterate and does not speak English.</P>
<P>6. I am further advised by Mr. Duong that, as of the date of swearing of this affidavit, he has not been able to communicate with the appellant with respect to her ability to pay costs. The process of communicating with the appellant requires translations by the appellant's daughter or granddaughter. Mr. Duong advises me that he is concerned about his ability to make arrangements with the appellant for the posting of security before the hearing of the appeal on March 7, 2019.</P>
<P>7. The respondent's bill of costs in respect of the appeal reflects, for some tariff items, the maximum allowable under the tariff for a full day appeal. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &lsquo;A&rsquo;</BOLD> is a draft bill of costs reflecting tariff items in the mid-range, for a half-day appeal.</P>
