<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>This appeal concerns the scope of the Province's consultation obligations to the Squamish Nation before issuing an Environmental Assessment Certificate (&ldquo;<BOLD>Certificate</BOLD>&rdquo;) for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. The Project proposal is to expand the existing Trans Mountain pipeline from a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen and refined products. It will result in new and expanded infrastructure in Squamish territory including in Burrard Inlet, and an increase in tanker traffic transiting the Inlet and the Salish Sea laden with diluted bitumen from 5 to 34 tankers per month.</P>
<P>The Squamish consider Burrard Inlet as their &ldquo;home&rdquo;. The lands, waters, and resources of their territory on which they depend stand to be adversely impacted by the Project.</P>
<P>The judge below recognized that the Province owed Squamish a duty to consult at the deep end of the <EM>Haida</EM> spectrum but found that the scope of that obligation was constrained by the constitutional limits on its authority. He found that it was acceptable for the Province to rely on the National Energy Board's (<BOLD>NEB</BOLD>) environmental review of the Project to satisfy the Province's statutory obligations under the <EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM> and its constitutional duty to consult, but scrutiny of that report fell to the Federal Court of Appeal. He also found that the Province was not obliged to consult with Squamish when the Province dramatically reversed its position previously taken before the NEB on the inadequacy of information about Project risks to the environment from shipping.</P>
<P>The Federal Court Appeal has now set aside the NEB's report as being so deeply flawed with respect to the environmental assessment of marine shipping that it does not constitute a &ldquo;report&rdquo;. This vindicates Squamish's position on its inadequacies. As the Province relied on this report to satisfy its own obligations, the necessary legal and statutory underpinning for the Certificate no longer exists and it must be quashed.</P>
<P>The judge also erred by finding that the Province's stated positions in the NEB process are irrelevant to subsequent consultation, that the Province was not in a positon to address deficiencies in the NEB report on which the Province relied to support its own statutory obligations, and in tailoring the depth of consultation owed by the Province to the perceived scope of its legislative jurisdiction, contrary to <EM>Haida</EM>.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>INTRODUCTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This is an appeal from a judgment of Grauer J. denying the Squamish Nation's (&ldquo;<BOLD>Squamish</BOLD>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<BOLD>Nation</BOLD>&rdquo;) petition to quash the decision of the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Natural Gas Development (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Ministers</BOLD>&rdquo;) under s. 17(3)(c) of the <EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM>, S.B.C. 2002, c. 43 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Act</BOLD>&rdquo;) to issue a Certificate for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;) on January 10, 2017 on the basis of the failure to consult and accommodate the Nation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment <UNDER><CASEREF><SOC>Squamish Nation v British Columbia (Environment)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 844</CITE></CASEREF></UNDER> (&ldquo;RFJ&rdquo;) (Appeal Record (&ldquo;AR&rdquo;), pp. 72&ndash;164)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>THE APPELLANTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. The appellants are the Squamish whose traditional territory (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Territory</BOLD>&rdquo;), located on the southwest coast of what is now British Columbia, is the chosen marine terminus for the Project. Squamish asserts rights and title over its Territory, which includes Burrard Inlet, Howe Sound, the Squamish Valley and north to Whistler. The Squamish rely on their territorial and reserve lands and the waters and resources adjacent to them to support them culturally, economically, socially and ceremonially.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 18 (AR, p. 79); Affidavit #1 of Ian Campbell made April 20, 2017 (&ldquo;Campbell Affidavit&rdquo;), paras. 6&ndash;8 (Joint Appeal Book (&ldquo;AB&rdquo;), Vol 1. pp. 2-3)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. Squamish has 24 reserves throughout Metro Vancouver, Howe Sound and the Squamish Valley. Three of those reserves are located on the North Shore in or at the entrance to Burrard Inlet: Seymour Creek Reserve No. 2 (ch'&ia;ch'elxwi7kw) at Second Narrows near the Westridge Marine Terminal, Mission Reserve No. 1 (eslh&aa;7an) at Mosquito Creek, and Capilano Reserve No. 5 (xwmelchstn) at First Narrows. These reserves stand to be directly impacted by the Project infrastructure, the marine terminal, and the increased tanker traffic that will pass by them. Also affected are Kitsilano Reserve No. 6 (senakw) near the entrance to False Creek, and at least three waterfront reserves in Howe Sound.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 19 (AR, p. 79); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 11&ndash;14 (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 3-4)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. The majority of Squamish members live in or near what is now North Vancouver and West Vancouver both on and off reserve within close proximity to the terminals and tanker routes. The majority of those members who live on reserve live on one of the reserves on the north shore of Burrard Inlet. The Squamish Council and main administrative office is at <EM>ch'&ia;ch'elxwi7kw</EM>&mdash;Seymour Creek Reserve across the Inlet from the Westridge Marine Terminal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 28 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 7)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. Generations of Squamish people have spoken about the importance of Burrard Inlet and English Bay as a &ldquo;home&rdquo; of the Squamish people. As reported in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (A.G.) v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2002 BCCA 478</CITE></CASEREF> (at para. 38) in 1886, when the Canadian Pacific Railway was seeking to obtain the entirety of the Squamish Nation's Kitsilano Reserve on False Creek for its western terminus, Squamish Chief Chepwhaim protested these efforts, in an address given to and recorded by Indian Commissioner I. W. Powell who visited the Reserve on June 15, 1886, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>We want you to write strongly about this land it is our home&mdash;our ancestors are buried here. We are willing to let the railroad pass through our land but no more. We hope you can protect us.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>6. Almost 130 years after Chief Chepwhaim's address and the coming of the railway, Squamish Elder David Jacobs, <EM>Paitsmauk</EM>, gave evidence in the NEB hearings for the Project about the continued significance of Burrard Inlet to the Squamish people, despite this industrial development, saying:
<QUOTE><P>All we see outside from our windows looking down the beach are freighters, ships, in and out. That's why I'm afraid today what the damage that if anything happened, it would destroy our home because that harbour, that bay there that's the home of the Squamish people. It's always been a home, our home.</P>
<P>We look at the maps. We show the territories of the Squamish. I don't like to use the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo;. I say, &ldquo;That is our home. That is our home&rdquo;. That land will never go away. Our Squamish people will never go away, so we got to be careful what we do today. [...]</P>
<P>Just one thing that I always think about. I think about love and our homelands and our villages. It's love for that. It's like the wind. It's still with us. It'll never go away.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 107, Ex. X (p. 381) (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 392, 399)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>7. Squamish continue to occupy, and be stewards of, their Territory, and harvest resources throughout it. Squamish has extensive traditional use and occupancy sites in Burrard Inlet, Indian Arm, southern Howe Sound and the lower Fraser River. These sites illustrate the extensive and intensive nature of Squamish use and occupation of these areas, and the dependency of Squamish culture and identity on the marine and aquatic environment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, paras. 18&ndash;20, 43&ndash;60 (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 4-5, 10&ndash;15)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>THE PROJECT AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON SQUAMISH</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. The Project is a proposal by Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (&ldquo;<BOLD>Trans Mountain</BOLD>&rdquo;) to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline system from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day for the transport of heavy oil, including diluted bitumen, between Edmonton and Burnaby for shipment out through Burrard Inlet and the Salish Sea. It will result in a large expansion of the Burnaby Terminal from 13 to 26 holding tanks, the construction of an entirely new Westridge Marine Terminal on Burrard Inlet with three new berths, and an increase in tanker traffic from five tankers per month to 34.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 15-16, 21 (AR, pp. 78-79); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 23&ndash;26 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 6)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The Project will impact areas that contain a concentration of Squamish cultural and spiritual values including multiple burial sites, ancestral villages, habitation sites, traditional transportation corridors and important fish, game and plant harvesting areas. Due to the density and significance of the cultural and spiritual values in the Project area, the lands and waters in this area are very sensitive to further development.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 22 (AR, p. 79); Campbell Affidavit, para. 30 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 7)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Squamish is uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of the Project and will bear the burden of risks arising from the increase in the transport of diluted bitumen, including risks of terrestrial and marine spills or other accidents in very sensitive areas&mdash;events that could be catastrophic for Squamish people, territory, economy and culture.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 22 (AR, p. 79); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 25, 28&ndash;32 (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 6, 7-8)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>PROVINCIAL REGULATORY SCHEME</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. The Act provides for the environmental assessment of &ldquo;reviewable projects&rdquo;, which are set out in the <EM>Reviewable Projects Regulation</EM>, B.C. Reg. 370/2002. A person cannot undertake a reviewable project without first undergoing an environmental assessment and obtaining a Certificate under the Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 44 (AR, p. 84)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Executive Director of the Environmental Assessment Office (<BOLD>EAO</BOLD>) determined under s. 10(1)(c) of the Act that a Certificate was required for this Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 45 (AR, p. 84); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. III (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1668-1669)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Once a determination under s. 10(1)(c) is made, the Executive Director must also determine by order under s. 11 of the Act (i) the scope of the required assessment of the reviewable project, and (ii) the procedures and methods for conducting the assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 46 (AR, p. 84); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. MMM (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1679-1680)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Once the environmental assessment is completed in accordance the Act, the Executive Director must refer the application to the Ministers under s. 17(1)(a) f or a determination. This referral must be accompanied by a referral package, consisting of an assessment report, together with the Executive Director's recommendations and reasons for recommendation (s. 17(2)).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 51 (AR, p. 85)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. On receipt of that referral, the Ministers must consider the assessment report and any recommendations, and may consider any other matters they consider relevant to the public interest (s. 17(3)). The Ministers must then do one of three things: issue the Certificate and attach such conditions as they consider necessary (s. 17(3)(c)(i)); refuse to issue the Certificate (s. 17(3)(c)(ii)); or order that further assessment be carried out (s. 17(3)(c)(iii)).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 52 (AR, p. 85)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>EQUIVALENCY AGREEMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. Section 27 of the Act allows the Minister to enter into an agreement that provides &ldquo;for a means to accept another party's or jurisdiction's assessment as being equivalent to an assessment required under this Act&rdquo;. This is referred to as an &ldquo;equivalency agreement&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 47-48 (AR, p. 84)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The EAO and the NEB entered into an equivalency agreement for environmental assessments of projects that trigger both a provincial environmental assessment and NEB review (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Equivalency Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;). It allows for an environmental assessment done by the NEB to serve as the environmental assessment required under the Act, even though it is not the EAO that conducts that assessment. In this case, the Executive Director invoked the Equivalency Agreement as applicable to the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 47-48, 54 (AR, pp. 84, 86); Campbell Affidavit, para. 62, Ex. C (AB, Vol. 1 p. 15)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. Clause 6 of the Equivalency Agreement allows either party to terminate the Agreement upon giving 30 days written notice to the other party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. C (p. 7) (AB, Vol. 1, p. 68)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Crown's duty to consult is triggered by any decision of the Province in relation to clause 6.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Coastal First Nations v.

<P>18. On January 13, 2016, the BC Supreme Court held in <UNDER><CASEREF><SOC>Coastal First Nations v. British Columbia (Minister of Environment)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 34</CITE></CASEREF></UNDER> that the Equivalency Agreement is invalid to the extent it purports to remove the need for the responsible Ministers to issue a Certificate under s. 17 of the Act. The Court further declared that the Province has an independent duty to consult with First Nations whose asserted rights or title stand to be affected by a project that is subject to the Equivalency Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 53&ndash;58, 61 (AR, pp. 86&ndash;88); <UNDER><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM></UNDER>, paras. 205, 209-201, 215</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI><UNDER>THE FEDERAL REGULATORY SCHEME</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. As the Project includes an interprovincial pipeline, it required a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (&ldquo;<BOLD>CPCN</BOLD>&rdquo;) and other related regulatory approvals under the <EM>National Energy Board Act</EM>, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-7 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>NEB Act</BOLD>&rdquo;). The NEB was tasked with undertaking a review of the Project under the NEB Act and an environmental assessment of the Project under the <EM>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</EM>, 2012, SC 2012, c 19, s 52 (&ldquo;<BOLD>CEAA 2012</BOLD>&rdquo;), and producing a recommendation and report for the Governor in Council (s. 52 of the NEB Act and s. 29 of the CEAA 2012).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 24 (AR, p. 80)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. After the NEB submits its report, the Governor in Council may, by order, approve the Project, send it back to the NEB for further consideration, or direct the NEB to reject the Project. The Governor in Council is also required to determine whether the Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects and whether those effects can or cannot be justified in the circumstances (CEAA 2012, s. 31).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 24&ndash;26 (AR, p. 80)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. In this case, as discussed below, the Governor in Council approved the Project with conditions but that approval was overturned by the Federal Court of Appeal.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Provincial Crown's Approach to Consultation</TI>
<P>22. The Province participated in the NEB process for this Project but did not specifically recognize that it had an obligation to make a separate determination about the Project under s. 17 of the Act or a distinct duty to consult with First Nations until after the decision in <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 87 (AR, p. 94)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The Province acknowledged it had a duty to consult Squamish at the deeper end of the <EM>Haida</EM> spectrum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 130 (AR, p. 80); <CASEREF><SOC>Haida Nation v.

He further said:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>Based on the NEB's report</UNDER>, the consideration of any additional information and Aboriginal consultation to date, EAO will identify any provincial environmental assessment certificate conditions to recommend to Ministers&rdquo; (emphasis added).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 87 (AR, pp. 94-95); Campbell Affidavit, Ex.

<P>24. Importantly, the Province's consultation with Squamish (and other First Nations) after this letter was conducted jointly with Canada. The Province largely relied upon, and followed the lead of, Canada in its so-called &ldquo;phase III&rdquo; consultation. Apart from one meeting with Squamish (discussed below), the Province did not consult independently.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 73 (AR, p. 90)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>Federal Crown's Approach to Consultation</TI>
<P>25. Given British Columbia's reliance on the NEB assessment and coordinated approach to consultation with Canada, it is necessary to describe the federal consultation processes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 71&ndash;74 (AR, pp. 89-90)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Canada's phased approach to aboriginal consultation was set out as follows: Phase I&mdash;Early engagement; Phase II&mdash;NEB hearings: Phase III&mdash;Government decision; and Phase IV&mdash;Regulatory authorizations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 75&ndash;77 (AR, pp. 90&ndash;92); Affidavit #2 of Ian Campbell made October 17, 2017(Campbell Affidavit #2), Exs.

<P>27. Canada stated that it was (i) &ldquo;relying on the NEB review process, to the extent possible, to identify, consider and address any adverse impacts on potential or established Aboriginal and treaty rights resulting from the Project&rdquo;; and (ii) the purpose of Phase III &ldquo;consultations is to conduct a meaningful two -way dialogue to determine if there are any concerns related to the Project that have not been fully addressed by the NEB's draft conditions or the proponent's commitments to that point in the process, and to consider proposals from Aboriginal groups for accommodation measures that could be considered by the Crown to further address outstanding issues or concerns.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>(a)</EM></N><TI><EM>Squamish's experience in the NEB process</EM></TI>
<P>28. The NEB's hearing order for the Project was issued on April 2, 2014. At the same time the NEB also issued the scoping decision for the Project that <UNDER>excluded</UNDER> marine shipping activities as part of the &ldquo;designated project&rdquo; under CEAA 2012.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 78 (AR, p. 92); Affidavit #1 of Robert Love made May 17, 2017, Exs. 13, 15 (AB, Vol. 7 pp. 2598-2599, 2603, 2617, 2620&ndash;2623)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Squamish was an intervenor in the hearing and participated in all stages to the extent possible. They made information requests, filed motions for adequate responses in relation to the information requests, filed written evidence, filed written argument, and made oral submissions to the NEB.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 78&ndash;84 (AR, pp. 92-93)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. From the outset, Squamish expressed concerns to the NEB and to British Columbia about the scope of the environmental assessment to be carried out.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 79 (AR, p. 92); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 72, 75, 86&ndash;102, 105, Exs. D, G, L&ndash;U (AB, Vol 1 pp. 17, 18, 20&ndash;23, 72-73, 80-81, 82&ndash;354)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By letter dated November 13, 2014, Squamish advised the Province that, in its view, the NEB process would not enable the Province to fulfill its legal obligations to the Squamish. Squamish stated that &ldquo;a number of issues important to Squamish, and other First Nations, have not been included within the scope of the [NEB's] environmental assessment for the Project, such as, but not limited to, marine shipping activities of the Project&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. D (AB, Vol.1 pp. 72-73)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. Squamish sought to use the NEB hearing process, and particularly the information request opportunities, to articulate its concerns and interests and to at tempt to obtain information it considered necessary to understand the potential impacts of the Project on its asserted Aboriginal rights and title. However, the Nation was unable to obtain the information it considered necessary for this purpose.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 80, 83-84 (AR, pp. 92&ndash;94); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 86&ndash;102, 105, Exs. L&ndash;U (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 20&ndash;23, 82&ndash;354)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The Nation's unsuccessful efforts to obtain what it considered necessary information and its potential impacts are significant for two reasons:
<P1>a) the gap in necessary information was the central concern raised by the Squamish in the Crown consultation process that followed the NEB process, and the information remained outstanding, with no explanation from the Crown (in either its federal or provincial emanations) as to why this information was not necessary to assess impacts on Squamish; and</P1>
<P1>b) throughout the NEB process, the Province shared the <UNDER>same concerns</UNDER> as Squamish with regard to the lack of information, including on environmental impacts of marine shipping and other subject matters of shared concern (discussed below).</P1></P>
<P>33. Among the information that Squamish sought, but did not receive, in the NEB process: the fate and behavior of diluted bitumen in an aquatic or marine environment, emergency response planning and preparedness, assessment of the risks of the Burnaby Terminal and Westridge Marine Terminal and a Squamish-specific assessment of impacts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 105 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 24)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On January 12, 2016, Squamish filed its final written argument in the NEB process asking the Board to recommend that the Project be rejected due to, among other reasons, the lack of information and assessment in relation to the impacts of the Project on Squamish, particularly in the event of a spill from the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 84 (AR, pp. 93-94)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(b)</EM></N><TI><EM>Province's Experience in the NEB process paralleled that of Squamish</EM></TI>
<P>35. The Province was also an intervenor in the NEB process and made numerous information requests of both Trans Mountain and Canada. The Province's main focus was on &ldquo;Trans Mountain's ability to effectively prevent and respond to spills from the proposed pipeline itself, or from tankers calling at the Westridge Marine Terminal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 31 (AR, p. 81); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 764) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 694)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Like Squamish, the Province was not satisfied with the information that was provided in response to these requests and unsuccessfully sought orders from the Board compelling better and more detailed information.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, paras. 114&ndash;121, Exs. FF&ndash;LL (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 27&ndash;29, Vol. 2, pp. 505&ndash;725)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. For instance, on December 5, 2014, the Province brought a motion before the board seeking an order that, among other things, Trans Mountain file unredacted copies of its Emergency Management Plan documents and the Oil Sp ill Response Plan of its spill recovery contractor, Western Canada Marine Response Corporation, to demonstrate that Trans Mountain has the ability to effectively respond to spills from the Project. The Province said that these plans &ldquo;are a mitigation measure against environmental harm that must be considered by the Board in its environmental assessment of the Project&rdquo; and &ldquo;in advance of certification&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 118, Exs. JJ (p. 720), KK (AB, Vol. 1 p. 28, Vol. 2 pp. 650, 686&ndash;691)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Squamish expressly supported the relief sought by the Province in the motion.</P>
<P>37. The Board dismissed the Province's motion in Ruling No. 50. The Board never required Trans Mountain to provide the emergency response documents or the information on oil spill prevention and response capacity that the Province deemed an &ldquo;imperative&rdquo; mitigation measure prior to Project approval.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 118, Ex. KK (AB, Vol. 1 p. 28, Vol. 2 pp. 686&ndash;691)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. In its closing argument before the NEB, the Province, like Squamish, stated that it cannot support approval of the Project due to the inadequacy of the evidence. The Province maintained that there was insufficient evidence about spill response to allow for a proper assessment of Trans Mountain's ability to respond to a spill<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 764) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 694); Affidavit #1 of Melanie Thompson</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and noted that many of the detailed plans &ldquo;that form part of an effective emergency response plan not only remain unprepared, but will, Trans Mountain tells us, be left to be formulated at the time of an incident.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 785) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 715)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. The Province also took issue with the &ldquo;lack of foundation or transparency&rdquo; in Trans Mountain's risk assessment with respect to the likelihood of marine spills, noting that it lacks sufficient foundation to be confidently relied upon by the Board and asked the Board to accord the risk assessment limited weight.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 790) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 720)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. The Province noted that &ldquo;it is obvious that a spill in the marine environment could have significant effects&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 790) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 720)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and submitted that:
<QUOTE><P>...no marine spill response plans, or other detailed information, have been put on the record to show the means by which a marine spill would be responded to. In the absence of this information, the Province is not satisfied that a &ldquo;world-leading&rdquo; marine spill response capability will in fact be in place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LL (p. 791) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 721)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>41. These concerns are aligned with those of the Squamish and are reflected in the Squamish Nation's own information requests and argument to the NEB, as well as in the information gaps identified by Squamish during the Crown consultation process that followed the NEB process.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>4.</N><TI>The National Energy Board Report</TI>
<P>42. On May 19, 2016, the NEB issued its report recommending approval of the Project. The NEB report did not deal specifically with Squamish's concerns or interests, or make any findings specific to Squamish. Rather, it contained only a general conclusion with regard to Aboriginal concerns, stating that &ldquo;the Board is satisfied that the Board's recommendation and decisions with respect to the Project are consistent with section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 33&ndash;36 (AR, pp. 81-82); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. AAA (NEB Report, p. xii) (AB, Vol. 2 p. 771)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It said that effects on Aboriginal interests &ldquo;can be effectively minimized&rdquo; and that, with the exception of traditional uses associated with the Southern resident killer whale, there would not be &ldquo;significant adverse effects on the ability of Aboriginal people to continue to use lands, waters and resources for traditional purposes&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. AAA (NEB Report, pp. 45&ndash;52) (AB, Vol. 3 pp. 820&ndash;827)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Following the Board's decision and the BCSC decision in <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, on May 24, 2016 Squamish asked the Province to terminate the Equivalency Agreement due to the flaws in the NEB assessment for the Project (as noted by both Squamish and the Province) and conduct its own environmental assessment. The Province refused to do so and relied on the NEB assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 90 (AR, p. 96); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. F (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 77&ndash;79)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>5.</N><TI>Phase III&mdash;Coordinated Crown Consultation</TI>
<P>44. By letter dated May 9, 2016, Mr. Braun of the EAO advised Squamish of the Province's intention to rely on the NEB assessment as an equivalent environmental assessment for the purposes of the Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 88-89 (AR, p. 95); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. JJJ (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1670&ndash;1675)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (This was later confirmed in an order dated June 17, 2016 made under s. 11 of the Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 92 (AR, p. 96); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. MMM (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1679&ndash;1689)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>)</P>
<P>45. Squamish questioned this decision in a letter dated May 24, 2016, noting that both Squamish and the Province expressed concerns with the NEB process. Squamish also pointed out that, despite the concerns it had previously raised with the Province (in its November 13, 2014 letter) about the adequacy of the NEB's (then) planned assessment, the Province did not consult with Squamish about whether the Equivalency Agreement should be terminated to allow for a full provincial environmental assessment. Squamish asked for an urgent meeting with the Province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 90 (AR, p. 96); Campbell Affidavit, Exs. D, F (AB, Vol. 1 pp. 72-73, 77&ndash;79)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In response, however, the Province reiterated its intention to adhere to the Equivalency Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 91 (AR, p. 96); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. LLL (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1676&ndash;1678)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. On June 23, 2016, Squamish, along with Tsleil-Waututh Nation, met with representatives of the Province to discuss their concerns with the reliance on the NEB assessment for the Project, and the failure of the Province to consult on the termination of the Equivalency Agreement. This was the only bilateral meeting between Squamish and the Province on the Project without Canada present.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 94 (AR, p. 98); Campbell Affidavit, para. 179 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 47)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The two Nations followed up on the meeting with a joint letter dated August 24, 2016 reiterating their concern that the NEB process did not provide for a proper assessment of Project impacts on their interests. They stated: &ldquo;Given that the Province has explicitly acknowledged the failure of the NEB process, we do not think it is appropriate for the provincial EA to rely on that process in any respect.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 94 (AR, p. 98); Campbell Affidavit, para. 180, Ex. NNN (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1690&ndash;1694)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. In an exchange of correspondence, and in a single meeting held jointly by Canada and the Province on October 18, 2016, Squamish maintained its ongoing request for outstanding information regarding Project impacts, including with respect to potential spills of diluted bitumen in Burrard Inlet and the Salish Sea&mdash;information that the Province also sought in the NEB process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 98, 101 (AR, pp. 99-100); Campbell Affidavit, paras. 182, 184, Ex.

SSS (p. 1256) (AB, Vol. 5 pp. 1703&ndash;1713)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. However, Canada and the Province jointly responded by stating their reliance on the NEB report and did not provide the additional information or agree to further study.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 102-103 (AR, pp. 100-101); Campbell Affidavit, para. 185, Ex.

<P>49. By letter dated November 18, 2016, Squamish responded to a package of material provided on behalf of the Province with the joint federal/provincial letter of November 3, 2016. Chief Campbell, on behalf of Squamish, in setting out the reasons why in Squamish's view the Province had not discharged the obligations to Squamish noted that &ldquo;[t]he Province piggybacked on the federal Crown consultation, and did not seek to directly engage Squamish on the information deficiencies in the NEB report.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 109-110 (AR, p. 104-105); Campbell Affidavit, para. 192, Ex.

<P>51.

<P>52. On August 30, 2018, the FCA quashed the federal approval on two main grounds:
<P1>a) The NEB failed to comply with its statutory obligation by wrongly excluding Project-related shipping from the scope of its environmental assessment, leading to &ldquo;successive, unacceptable deficiencies in the Board's report and recommendations&rdquo;. The FCA found that the NEB report was so materially flawed that it did not constitute a &ldquo;report&rdquo; under the applicable legislation; and</P1>
<P1>b) Canada did not fulfill its duty to consult with and accommodate the Indigenous applicants.

<P>53. On December 8, 2016, the EAO informed Squamish that it had referred the Project for the Ministers' decision. It asserted that, because of the Equivalency Agreement, the &ldquo;EAO was not in a position to conduct further technical assessment of the Project during its review&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 112 (AR, pp. 105-106); Campbell Affidavit, Ex.

<P>54. On January 10, 2017, the Ministers made the decision to issue the Certificate for the Project, subject to 37 conditions.

<P>55. The Decision of the Ministers represents a substantive change in the Province's position as articulated in the NEB process, including in its motions and its final submissions. The Province did not notify Squamish of this change in position, or consult Squamish on the basis or reasons for this change of position.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 201 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 55)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>J.</N><TI><UNDER>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT BELOW</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. Squamish brought a petition challenging the Ministers' decision to issue the Certificate. Squamish sought an order quashing the decision and declarations that the Province did not meet its constitutional duty to consult and accommodate Squamish.</P>
<P>57. The judge in the Court below acknowledged that it was not in dispute that the Ministers owed an obligation to consult Squamish at the deep end of the spectrum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 130 (AR, p. 115)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, he held that &ldquo;British Columbia faced limits on its authority that Canada did not&rdquo; and that &ldquo;assessing the reasonableness of the Minister's conclusion that consultation was adequate must include reference to this context&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 158 (AR, p. 122)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this context, the judge concluded that &ldquo;within the limits of its authority, British Columbia ascertained and addressed [Squamish] concerns, balancing them with societal interests&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it cannot be said that adequate consultation reasonably required British Columbia to correct any perceived shortfall in the NEB process&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 169, 171 (AR, p. 125)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The judge did not accept that the Province was obligated to explain to Squamish the basis for its change in position from the NEB process, and found that the Province's position before the Board was &ldquo;irrelevant to the question the Ministers had to consider of whether consultation was adequate in the context of the Certificate process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 177 (AR, p. 127)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59.

<P1>b) that adequate consultation did not and, constitutionally, could not require the Province to fill information gaps (or consult about filling perceived gaps) in the NEB assessment before deciding whether to issue a Certificate;</P1>
<P1>c) that the Province did not have an obligation to consult with Squamish on the Province's change in position from the NEB process on the adequacy of information on Project-related spills; and</P1>

<P>62. Squamish argued in the Court below that the NEB process and report was a legally insufficient foundation for the Province to conduct its environmental assessment and discharge its duty to consult, but the judge held that Squamish &ldquo;must find its remedies for such shortfalls in the Federal Court proceedings, not in this one&rdquo; and that in this proceeding &ldquo;the NEB process is the starting point, not the end point.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 169-170 (AR, p. 125)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. The judge erred by not setting aside the Certificate due to its reliance on the flawed NEB report, and the FCA's judgment in <EM>Tsleil-Waututh Nation</EM>, which set aside the NEB report, now confirms that.

The FCA held that the &ldquo;Board unjustifiably excluded Project-related shipping from the Project's definition&rdquo; and this undermined the central finding of the report that the Project was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, paras. 5, 470, 764</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It found that the NEB report was so materially flawed that it did not constitute a &ldquo;report&rdquo; under the applicable legislation, and concluded that &ldquo;[w]ith such a flawed report before it, the Governor in Council could not legally make the kind of assessment of the Project's environmental effects and the public interest that the legislation requires.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, paras. 470, 766</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. The FCA ordered that the NEB's recommendations be referred back to the Board with the specific direction that it ought to reconsider the environmental assessment of the Project in light of the inclusion of Project-related marine shipping in the Project's definition and the Board's recommendation under s. 29 of the CEAA 2012. Canada was also required to &ldquo;re-do its Phase III consultation&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, paras. 770-771</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3.</N><TI>Environmental Assessment Report is Mandatory</TI>
<P>66. Under section 17 of the Act, it is a statutory precondition to the Ministers' decision on issuing a Certificate that an environmental assessment is carried out in accordance with the relevant statutory obligations. The Ministers have no jurisdiction under the Act to issue a Certificate without an environmental assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM>, s. 17 (&ldquo;<EM>EAA</EM>&rdquo;); RFJ, paras. 45 (AR, p. 84)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>67. Through the Equivalency Agreement and the EAO's section 11 Order under the Act, the Province placed its complete reliance on the NEB report to fulfill the provincial statutory obligation for an environmental assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 50 (AR, p. 85)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The section 11 Order made under the Act confirms that &ldquo;[t]he NEB Report is equivalent to the assessment report required under section 17(2) of the Act&rdquo; and that the Province's Summary Assessment Report, submitted to the Ministers just summarizes &ldquo;the key findings of the NEB Panel that are relevant to the Ministers environmental assessment certificate decision.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. MMM (p. 1220) (AB, Vol. 5 p. 1682)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>68. The judge found that the NEB and federal cabinet processes &ldquo;played a significant role in British Columbia's environmental assessment process, with the NEB review constituting the required assessment under the EAA pursuant to the Equivalency Agreement.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 72 (AR p. 90)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, the Reasons for the Ministers' Decision state that &ldquo;[t]he NEB Report is the assessment report that [they] have considered for the Project&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. FFFF (p. 1399) (AB, Vol. 6 p. 2149)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Certificate itself notes in the recital that the NEB completed the assessment for the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. EEEE (p. 1372) (AB, Vol. 6 p. 2122)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province did not undertake any further assessment with respect to the Project.</P>
<P>69. Having placed complete reliance on the NEB process and report, and not having done its own assessment, the Province's Certificate must stand or fall on that report. In accepting &ldquo;any&rdquo; NEB assessment as found by the judge below, the Ministers assumed not only the benefits of the NEB assessment (thus relieving the EAO of the need to do its own assessment) but also the risks of the NEB assessment, including any inadequacies that might cause it to be struck down or otherwise found to be invalid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 50 (AR, p. 85)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. Since the FCA has held that the NEB report is so materially flawed that it does not constitute a &ldquo;report&rdquo;, the legal underpinnings for the decision to issue the Certificate, as required by the Act, have fallen away and the Certificate must be quashed as being inconsistent not only with the duty to consult, but with the statutory requirement (s. 17(2)) upon which the decision is based.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, para. 470</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>71. Further, since the NEB assessment did not properly account for the environmental effects of the Project, it did not provide the Ministers with t he foundation to make an informed decision about the Project's environmental effects that the Act and the duty to consult with Squamish requires.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>EAA</EM>, s. 17; <UNDER><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM></UNDER>, paras. 102, 104, 105, 109, 134, 137&ndash;140; <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of Davie Bay v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 293</CITE><PARANUM>8, 40</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Alberta Wilderness Association v Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans)</SOC><CITE>[1999] 1 FC 483</CITE><COURTJUR>FCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, paras. 17-18</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. With Phase II (NEB assessment) now being reset with respect to the environmental assessment for the Project, particularly in relation to one of Squamish's key concerns over the environmental effects of marine shipping, there is no longer a foundation for the Province's consultation with Squamish. The Province cannot discharge its duty to consult Squamish when, as found by the FCA, the Project-related effects on the marine environment have not yet been properly assessed. The Province expressly asserted jurisdiction in respect of the environmental impacts of marine shipping,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. FFFF (pp. 1400&ndash;1404) (AB, Vol. 6 pp. 2150&ndash;2154)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> so this deficiency in the report is material to how the Project impacts on Squamish's asserted rights and title in respect of matters within provincial jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>4.</N><TI>The Certificate Must be Quashed</TI>
<P>73. Since the NEB report did not account for the full extent of the environmental effects of the Project, it can no longer serve as the basis for the Ministers' decision on the Certificate. The Ministers erred in issuing the Certificate in reliance on the materially flawed NEB report (even though Squamish had brought the relevant errors to the Ministers attention in Phase III) and the Court below erred in proceeding on the assumption that the NEB report constituted a valid equivalent assessment under s. 17(2) of the Act. The FCA has confirmed that the report is not valid.</P>
<P>74. The Judge acknowledged the potential effect of the parallel proceedings before the FCA noting that:
<QUOTE><P>Of course, if the Federal Court of Appeal should rule in favour of Squamish's position concerning the inadequacy of the NEB hearing, then what consultation occurred within British Columbia's jurisdiction would become largely moot in relation to the EAC at issue here. Subject to further appeal, the entire Phase II (NEB hearing) process would be reset.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 134 (AR, p. 115)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>75. That is what has now happened, and in these circumstances, the proper course is for the Certificate to be quashed and sent back to the Ministers for redetermination following the completion of a proper assessment report.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>MISINTERPRETATION OF THE SCOPE OF PROVINCE'S OBLIGATIONS</UNDER></TI>
<P>76. The judge erred in finding that the Province fulfilled its duty to consult by relying on the NEB assessment of the Project without considering further assessment and by piggy-backing on the federal government's Phase III consultation, which has now been found by the FCA to fall well short of the required standard.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Province Wrongly Constrained Itself</TI>
<P>77. The judge below misinterpreted the scope of the Province's obligations in finding that &ldquo;[a]dequate consultation did not <UNDER>and, constitutionally, could not</UNDER> require British Columbia to redo the NEB process in order to fill information gaps before deciding whether to issue a Certificate&rdquo; (emphasis added).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 174 (AR p. 176)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While it is not suggested that the Province would &ldquo;redo&rdquo; the entire NEB process, it was open to the Province to conduct further assessments on its own to address shortcomings in the NEB process and report.</P>
<P>78. While the Crown can rely on a regulatory process to fulfil the duty to consult, such reliance is subject to the Crown's overarching duty to ensure consultation is adequate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 53</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here, the Province relied on the NEB report and took the erroneous position that &ldquo;[g]iven the EAO-NEB Equivalency Agreement, EAO was not in a position to conduct further technical assessment of the Project during its review&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. BBBB (p. 1325) (AB, Vol. 6 p. 2075)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. Since the honour of the Crown cannot be delegated, it is always open to the Crown to conduct further assessments beyond a regulatory proceeding to fulfill its constitutional obligations to consult.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>West Moberly First Nations v. British Columbia (Chief Inspector of Mines)</SOC><CITE>2011 BCCA 247</CITE><PARANUM>106</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 53, <UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, para. 493</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM>, the FCA said that (at paras. 627-628):
<QUOTE><P>...reliance on the Board's process <UNDER>does not allow Canada to rely unwaveringly upon the Board's findings</UNDER> and recommended conditions. When real concerns were raised about the hearing process or the Board's findings and recommended conditions, Canada was required to dialogue meaningfully about those concerns.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>... Phase III of the consultation process afforded Canada the opportunity, and the responsibility, to dialogue about the asserted flaws in the Board's process and recommendations. This it failed to do.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>80. The same may be said of the Province. <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> confirmed for the Province that it held a distinct obligation to consult with First Nations, separate from Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM></UNDER>, para. 196</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province was wrong to consider itself constrained by the Equivalency Agreement from conducting further assessments to fulfill the duty to consult.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, paras. 627-628</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> When it closed consultation without taking steps to fill the information deficiencies in the NEB process, to explain to Squamish why that information was not (or, considering the Province's position in the NEB Process, no longer) necessary to assess the potential impacts to their rights and title or to address Squamish's outstanding concerns, it failed to uphold the honour of the Crown.</P>
<P>81. This misapprehension of the scope of the Province's obligations is to be reviewed on the standard of correctness, not on a reasonableness standard as held by the judge below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 133 (AR, p. 115); <UNDER>Haida</UNDER>, para. 61; <UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, para. 225</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>Province's Consultation Stands or Falls with Canada's Phase III</TI>
<P>82. The consultation between Squamish and the Province on the Project consisted of an exchange of correspondence and two meetings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, para. 171 (AB, Vol. 1 p. 45)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As the judge below noted, once the NEB report was issued, the Province coordinated its consultation activities with the federal Crown &ldquo;making use of the federal consultation record that preceded British Columbia's regulatory involvement in the environmental assessment process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 73 (AR, p. 90)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Apart from the single meeting with Tsleil-Waututh Nation at the outset of the consultation process, the Province conducted no independent consultation outside of the federal process.</P>
<P>83. The FCA has now found that &ldquo;Canada's execution of Phase III consultation process was unacceptably flawed and fell short of the standard prescribed by the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, para. 557</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With the FCA having now reached this conclusion, the Province's consultation must also fail.</P>
<P>84. The Province deliberately chose to place its reliance on the federal government's Phase III consultation. Having conducted no substantive consultation outside of that federally-led process, the Province's consultation must therefore stand or fall on the strength of that federal process. With the FCA now confirming that the federal process fell well short of the mark, the Province's adhesion to it cannot stand.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>PROVINCE'S CHANGE IN POSITION</UNDER></TI>
<P>85. The judge below erred in finding that the honour of the Crown did not require the Province to discuss its change of position with regard to the Project and the information necessary to assess the Project's impacts with the Squamish before approving it.</P>
<P>86. As described above, throughout the entire NEB process, Squamish and the Province were <EM>ad idem</EM> on the need for further specific information and assessment regarding Project-related spills and the ability to clean up a spill of diluted bitumen in a marine environment. The Province opposed the approval of the Project before the NEB in part because of the failure of Trans Mountain to provide, and the NEB to insist on, the provision of this information. As both the Province and Squamish were intervenors in the NEB process, the Province knew that its position aligned with the Squamish's concerns.</P>
<P>87. At some point between submissions to the NEB on January 11, 2016 and the Ministers' decision on January 10, 2017 to grant the Certificate, the Province substantively changed its position on the NEB's assessment of key aspects of concern to Squamish, including emergency response preparedness, spill risk and spill response. The Province did not advise Squamish of or discuss with them this change in position or the reason for it.</P>
<P>88. The Ministers' decision acknowledges &ldquo;that many Aboriginal groups raised concerns about the potential serious impacts on their Aboriginal Interests if a spill occurred&rdquo;. However, the Ministers go on to rely on the NEB's assessment of that risk without any explanation for why that assessment is now considered by the Province to be adequate when it previously considered it to be so inadequate that the Province could not support the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. FFFF (p. 1402, 1404) (AB, Vol. 6 pp. 2152, 2154)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>89. There was no new information put before the Ministers or presented to Squamish following the NEB process that addressed the Province's and Squamish's concerns regarding emergency response preparedness, spill risk and spill response. Based on the Ministers' reasons for decision, it appears that the Province felt that its concerns about marine spills and emergency response were addressed through the Government of Canada's announcement of the Oceans Protections Plan. However, it did not discuss its change of position, or the basis for it, with Squamish to see if it addressed their concerns.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit, Ex. FFFF (p. 1403) (AB, Vol. 6 p. 2153); Campbell #2, Ex. C (AB, Vol. 13 pp. 5326&ndash;5338)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>90. The NEB process was expressly stated to be part of the process by which the Crown would discharge its duty to consult. It is not in keeping with the high standard of dealings required by the honour of the Crown for the Province to take a position in that process that fully aligns with the Squamish's concerns, only to later reverse that position and abandon its concerns that were previously in line with Squamish's views without first discussing that change in position with Squamish.</P>
<P>91. The judge found that the Province was playing a different role advocating a position before the NEB when it raised concerns about inadequate information on spill response planning and preparedness (among other things). He held that the &ldquo;position taken by British Columbia during the NEB hearings is irrelevant to the question the Ministers had to consider of whether consultation was adequate in the context of the Certificate process&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 177 (AR, p. 127)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In these circumstances, he found that this dynamic did not &ldquo;constitute a change in position that gave rise to a specific duty to consult beyond the acknowledged overarching duty.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 176&ndash;179 (AR, p. 127)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>92. Meaningful consultation &ldquo;entails testing and being prepared to amend policy proposals in light of the information received, <UNDER>and providing feedback</UNDER>&rdquo; (emphasis added).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 46</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>93. Good faith is required on both sides in the consultative process: &ldquo;The common thread on the Crown's part must be &ldquo;the intention of substantially addressing [Aboriginal] concerns' as they are raised [...] through a meaningful process of consultation&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Tsleil-Waututh</EM></UNDER>, para. 496; <UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 42</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The &ldquo;controlling question in all situations is what is required to maintain the honour of the Crown and to effect reconciliation between the Crown and the Aboriginal peoples with respect to the interests at stake&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, paras. 42, 45-46, <CASEREF><SOC>Mikisew Cree First Nation v.

<P>94. The judge erred in finding that British Columbia wore a different hat (as advocate) in the NEB process than it did when it was participating in the Phase III consultation and making the decision to grant the Certificate. &ldquo;The honour of the Crown is <UNDER>always</UNDER> at stake in its dealings with Aboriginal peoples&rdquo; (emphasis added).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 16</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province's function in one part of the approval process cannot be distinguished from any other part of the process. Regardless of whether the Province was involved in consultation before the NEB, this was a process that was going to affect Squamish's interests and the Crown's honour is at stake throughout. The NEB process was expressly part of the overall process by which the Crown would fulfill its duty and the Province's function cannot be parsed out in the manner suggested by the judge.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kwikwetlem First Nation v. British Columbia (Utilities Commission)</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 68</CITE><PARANUM>62</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>95. Further, Squamish does not (and did not) argue that the Province's unilateral change of position was itself a decision that independently attracted the duty to consult. Rather, that change in position was part of a course of dealings by the Province involving the Squamish within a broader consultation process that included the NEB process.</P>
<P>96. The judge took an inappropriately narrow view of the Province's obligations to Squamish in the circumstances. The Province's (and Squamish's) position before the NEB that not enough was known about Project-related spills is directly relevant to the Province's obligation to inform itself of the impact of the Project on Squamish.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Mikisew</EM></UNDER>, paras. 54-55, 64; <CASEREF><SOC>Gitxaala Nation v.

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>PROVINCE'S CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON THE DUTY TO CONSULT</UNDER></TI>
<P>97. Much of the judge's reasoning in the Court below turns on what he saw as the limited role that the Province had to play with respect to the Project. He held that &ldquo;[w]hile the constitutionally guaranteed duty to consult is &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; of statutes like the EAA, it is [<EM>sic</EM>] does not alter the constitutional division of powers between the federal and provincial arms of government&rdquo; and that &ldquo;British Columbia's consultation obligations are accordingly subject to the limits of its constitutional authority.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 136 (AR, p. 116)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He was of the view that &ldquo;assessing the reasonableness of the Minister's conclusion that consultation was adequate must include reference to this context.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 158 (AR, p. 122)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>98. Squamish submits that the judge erred in tailoring the depth of the Province's duty to consult with Squamish to the strength of the Province's jurisdiction in respect of this matter. The Province had a decision to make in respect of the Project within its jurisdiction and that decision had the potential to infringe the Squamish's asserted Aboriginal rights and title. The depth of the required consultation is dependent on the strength of Squamish's claim and the degree of impact on their asserted rights and title,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, paras. 39, 43-44</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> not on the strength of the Province's jurisdiction.</P>
<P>99. The Province asserts jurisdiction over the environmental impacts of marine shipping and it had the authority at least to undertake further assessment to better understand the impacts of the Project, particularly with respect to Project spills and the resources required to clean them up, and to impose Project conditions to better address those potential impacts and manage the risk. The decision to grant the Certificate without further assessment authorizes the Project to proceed without information that the Province itself once considered essential to assess Project impacts. The Province's decision therefore has a significant impact on Squamish's asserted rights and the extent of that obligation is not proportionate to a measure of its legislative jurisdiction over the Project.</P>
<P>100. Moreover, aside from whether it is correct to limit the Province's consultation obligation based on the extent of its jurisdiction, the judge erred by not finding a concomitant duty to discuss these constraints with Squamish at the outset of the consultation process.</P>
<P>101. The Ministers' reasons for the decision describe, in their vie w, the constitutional landscape within which they were operating, namely that it was &ldquo;primarily federally&mdash;regulated undertaking&rdquo; pursuant to s. 92(10)(a) of the <EM>Constitution Act</EM>. While the Ministers recognized they retained the power to attach conditions to the Certificate pursuant to <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, they said that they undertook their considerations &ldquo;aware that any EA Certificate condition cannot conflict with federal law or federally legally imposed requirements, or frustrate their purpose&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 117 (AR, pp. 107-108); Campbell Affidavit, Ex. FFFF (p. 1399) (AB, Vol. 6 p. 2149)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>102. Yet the Province did not discuss with Squamish prior to approving the Project the extent of the constitutional constraints it considered itself to be under or how this might affect the conditions it attached to the Certificate.</P>
<P>103. If the Province considered itself to be constrained in what it could and could not do, or what topics it could and could not discuss, with respect to consulting and accommodating asserted Aboriginal rights, the honour of the Crown compels it to at least discuss those perceived constraints, and their potential ramifications, with the affected First Nation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Mikisew</EM></UNDER>, paras. 54-55, 64; <UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, para. 43</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is particularly so if these constraints result in the Crown being held to a lower standard of conduct.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>Haida</EM></UNDER>, paras. 42, 45, 48, 62</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By failing to discuss these perceived constraints with Squamish, the Province fell short of meeting its duty to consult and the judge erred in finding otherwise.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>At its core, this appeal is about the Province's limited jurisdiction over the approval of a federal pipeline project: the Trans Mountain Expansion Project.</P>
<P>Squamish remains vehemently opposed to the Project. It sought judicial review of both federal and provincial Project approvals. Now, Squamish asserts that the provincial Project approval must be quashed because the federal approval was quashed.</P>
<P>This argument fails to recognize the significant limits on provincial jurisdiction. While the Province retains some limited jurisdiction over environmental matters, only Canada can determine whether the Project proceeds. Further, the Province's consultation process was not tainted by the flaws identified in the execution of Canada's consultation process.</P>
<P>Here, the Province was an active participant in, and reasonably relied on, a 2+ year National Energy Board review process. Ultimately, BC was satisfied that the process fulfilled the Province's environmental assessment obligations. While the Province was at liberty to impose an additional environmental assessment process, it chose not to do so.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the Province engaged in its own review process, consulted on matters within its provincial jurisdiction and imposed 37 additional conditions on the Project. In doing so, the Province more than met its provincial environmental assessment obligations. The Chambers Judge reasonably found as much.</P>
<P>To the extent the Federal Court of Appeal subsequently found that the NEB process was flawed, it did so on the basis of a clear federal issue. None of the issues on which the Applicants argued successfully at the FCA were of provincial jurisdiction. Indeed, the Province has no jurisdiction to mitigate the impacts of Project-related marine shipping.</P>
<P>Finally, the Chambers Judge found as a fact that provincial consultation was adequate. This finding was eminently reasonable. The Province's consultation representatives were more than note-takers and did not simply follow the NEB recommendation and conditions. Indeed, the Province actively participated in the NEB process to advocate for BC's interests. The Province also imposed additional conditions based on its own meaningful two-way dialogue with Squamish and others. Squamish fails to identify any error. This appeal must fail.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Proponent, the Project and Related Marine Shipping</TI>
<P>1. TM is the proponent of the Project. The Project will nearly triple the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Pipeline</BOLD>&rdquo;) that transports oil from Alberta to BC. Project components include: (i) the twinning of the existing Pipeline; (ii) new and modified facilities, including pump stations and tanks; and, (iii) three new berths at the Westridge Marine Terminal (&ldquo;<BOLD>WMT</BOLD>&rdquo;) in Burnaby, BC. Over 89% of the route parallels existing disturbances, including the Pipeline right of way.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 15-16 (Appeal Record (&ldquo;<BOLD>AR</BOLD>&rdquo;), p. 78); NEB Report, pp. 1-2, 278, 495-496 (Appeal Book (&ldquo;<BOLD>AB</BOLD>&rdquo;), Vol. 2, pp. 776-777, Vol. 3, pp. 1053, Vol. 4, pp. 1270-1271).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. The purpose of the Project is to expand Canadian crude oil exports markets in the Pacific Basin. This will provide a critical market alternative for Canadian producers and a projected $73.5 billion increase in Canadian oil production revenues in the first 20 years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 17 (AR, p. 78); NEB Report, pp. 14-15 (AB, Vol. 2, p. 789-790).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>5. The federal Project review is critical to understanding the BC review that followed.</P>
<P>6. To implement its exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines, Parliament assigned to the NEB and GIC the task of balancing project risks and benefits and determining the terms and conditions to any approval.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Constitution Act, 1867</EM>, ss. 91(29), 92(10)(a); RFJ, para. 24 (AR, p. 80); <CASEREF><SOC>Burnaby (City) v.

<P>7. To proceed, the Project required from the NEB: (i) a certificate of public convenience and necessity (&ldquo;<BOLD>CPCN</BOLD>&rdquo;), following GIC approval; and, (ii) once built, leave to open, following the NEB's determination that it can be safely operated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Act, ss. 2 (&ldquo;certificate&rdquo;), 30, 47, 52-54; <EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 9, 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. Prior to this, the NEB was required to hold a public hearing, conduct an EA and issue a report for the GIC that sets out its recommendation as to whether, and on what terms, the CPCN should be granted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 25 (AR, p. 80); <EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 55&ndash;62.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The controlling considerations for the NEB and GIC, both acting under legislated time limits, are whether the project: (i) is and will be required by the present public convenience and necessity; (ii) is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects; and, (iii) if so, whether those effects are justified.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 55-56, 62; NEB Act, ss. 52(1), (2), (4), (7), 54(3); CEAA 2012, ss. 29(1), 31(1)(a).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Additionally, the GIC can only approve a project if Canada has met its duty to consult.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gitxaala Nation v.

<P>10. Once approved, the proponent has the statutory power to do all acts necessary for the construction, maintenance, operation and abandonment of its pipeline.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Act, s. 73.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. Project approval is just one phase of NEB lifecycle regulation. Prior to construction, the proponent must satisfy all pre-construction conditions, obtain NEB approval of the detailed route, and complete the detailed pipeline design. Prior to operations, the proponent must complete all pre-operation conditions, develop an emergency response plan in compliance with the <EM>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</EM> and obtain leave to open. Throughout the project lifecycle, the NEB verifies compliance, oversees emergency preparedness and response and employs enforcement measures where necessary to obtain compliance, prevent harm and deter future non-compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Report, pp. 7&ndash;10, 19&ndash;23, 139 (AB, pp. Vol. 2, pp. 782&ndash;785, 794&ndash;798, Vol. 3, p. 914); <EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 286&ndash;289.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The BC Regulatory Framework</TI>
<P>12. To proceed in BC, &ldquo;transmission pipelines&rdquo; of a certain size must obtain an EAC from the BC Ministers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM>, S.B.C. 2002, c. 43 (&ldquo;<BOLD>EAA</BOLD>&rdquo;), ss. 1 (&ldquo;reviewable project&rdquo;), 8-9; <EM>Reviewable Projects Regulation</EM>, B.C. Reg. 370/2002, Table 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the BC Ministers cannot refuse to grant an EAC for an interprovincial project or otherwise obstruct, impair or frustrate such a project or federal authority over it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 7&ndash;9 (AR, p. 76); <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, paras. 47, 55, 58, 76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. The BC review process typically requires the EAO to conduct an EA and prepare an assessment report. Based on that report, the EAO Executive Director's recommendation, and any other relevant information, the BC Ministers must either: (i) issue an EAC with or without conditions; (ii) refuse to issue an EAC; or, (iii) order further assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAA, ss. 10-11, 16-17; Braun Affidavit, paras. 3-7 (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2714&ndash;2718).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As a lifecycle regulator, the EAO monitors condition compliance during project construction and operation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAA, ss. 34&ndash;37, 41, 43, 45; EAC E17-01, p. 2, para. I (AB, Vol. 6, p. 2123).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. To promote coordination, achieve efficiencies and avoid duplication in the EA process, the EAO has exercised its statutory powers to enter into an &ldquo;<BOLD>Equivalency Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo; with the NEB which provides that where both provincial and federal EAs are triggered the EAO will accept a NEB EA as equivalent to a BC EA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAA, ss. 27-28; Equivalency Agreement, recitals, ss. 1&ndash;3, 5&ndash;7 (AB, Vol. 1, pp. 66&ndash;68).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. It is not unusual for the Province to participate in the federal EA process for projects subject to the Equivalency Agreement, as it did in this case.</P>
<P>16. Initially, the Equivalency Agreement provided that an EAC was not required for projects subject to it. However, in the January 2016 <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> decision regarding the Northern Gateway Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>NGP</BOLD>&rdquo;), Koenigsberg J. found that clause to be <EM>ultra vires</EM> the EAO's statutory power.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, paras. 182-183; Braun Affidavit, para. 10 (AB, Vol. 7, p. 2714).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>The Federal Regulatory Review</TI>
<P>17. In 2013, TM submitted its 15,000 page application to the NEB for a CPCN.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, para. 11; Love Affidavit, paras. 16-17 (AB, Vol. 6, p. 2169).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The NEB hearing was among the largest in its history, including the participation of more than 400 intervenors and 1,250 commenters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 28 (AR, p. 80); Love Affidavit, para. 34 (AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2173 -2174).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Both Squamish and the Province were intervenors.</P>
<P>18. The NEB's list of issues included, among other things: (i) potential environmental and socio-economic effects, including cumulative effects; (ii) potential environmental and socio-economic effects of Project-related marine shipping activities, including accidents or malfunctions; (iii) potential impacts on Aboriginal interests; (iv) contingency plans for spills, accidents or malfunctions; and, (v) safety and security during construction and operation, including emergency response planning and third-party damage prevention.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Love Affidavit, para. 32 (AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2172-2173); NEB Report, p. 409 (AB, Vol. 3, p. 1184).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. The NEB determined that Project-related marine shipping was not part of the &ldquo;designated project&rdquo; to be assessed under CEAA 2012. Nevertheless, the NEB considered Project-related marine shipping under its broader NEB Act jurisdiction to assess impacts and make a recommendation in the public interest. Additionally, the NEB considered the cumulative effects of the Project and its related marine shipping under CEAA 2012. As a result, the NEB considered detailed and extensive evidence and submissions on the potential environmental effects of Project-related marine shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Report, pp. 6, 16-17, 332 (AB, Vol. 2, pp. 781, 791-792, Vol. 3, p. 1107). See also Chapter 14 (AB, Vol. 3, pp. 1098&ndash;1182).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Further, in conjunction with the NEB process, TM initiated TERMPOL, chaired by TC and consisting of other federal agencies. TERMPOL focused on the safety and risks of Project-related marine tanker movements between the Pacific Ocean to, from and around the WMT. The TERMPOL report was part of TC's evidence at the NEB. TM adopted each of TERMPOL's 17 recommendations and 31 findings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 29 (AR, p. 81); <EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 11, 88&ndash;93; TERMPOL Review Process Report (AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2232&ndash;2288).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. The 2+ year NEB review consisted of: (i) procedural and constitutional motions by intervenors; (ii) more than 17,000 intervenor information requests (&ldquo;<BOLD>IRs</BOLD>&rdquo;) to TM; (iii) oral traditional evidence from 35 Indigenous groups; (iv) written evidence, including expert reports from TM and intervenors; (v) written and oral argument; and, (vi) intervenor comments on the NEB's draft conditions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 30&ndash;32 (AR, p. 81); <EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 94&ndash;98; Love Affidavit, paras. 16&ndash;73 (AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2169&ndash;2187).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. Squamish was granted $44,270 in NEB participant funding and participated through motions, 344 IRs, oral traditional evidence, 219 pages of written evidence, written and oral argument, and comments on draft conditions. Squamish's evidence and submissions addressed concerns regarding a potential oil spill, emergency preparedness and response, a lack of information on key issues of concern and marine shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 28, 79&ndash;84 (AR, pp. 80, 92&ndash;94).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The Province also participated in the NEB process through motions, 544+ IRs, written argument and comments on draft conditions. The Province's submissions addressed its concerns regarding a potential oil spill, emergency preparedness and response, a lack of information on key issues of concern and marine shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The Province's NEB process materials are included in AB, Vol. 2, pp. 505&ndash;550, 644&ndash;685, 692&ndash;725, Vol. 6, pp. 2289&ndash;2498, Vol. 7, pp. 2499&ndash;2510, Vol. 13, pp. 5225&ndash;5304.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>The NEB Report Recommending Project Approval</TI>
<P>24. In May 2016 the NEB issued its 500+ page report that recommended that the GIC approve the Project, subject to the Federal Conditions, in the Canadian public interest.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 36 (AR, p. 82); NEB Report, pp. xi-xii, xv, 18 (AB, Vol. 2, pp. 770-771, 774, 793).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. To reach this conclusion, the NEB considered, among other things: (i) potential impacts on Aboriginal groups; (ii) pipeline and facility integrity; (iii) safety, security and emergency management; (iv) the environmental behaviour of spilled oil; (v) emergency prevention, preparedness and response; (vi) potential effects on the air, surface and groundwater, terrestrial and marine wildlife, soil, plants, communities, land use and human health; (vii) the need for the Project and economic feasibility; (viii) financial assurances for the cost of an oil spill; and, (ix) Project-related marine shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Report, pp. iii&ndash;viii, xi&ndash;xv (AB, Vol. 2, pp. 762&ndash;767, 770&ndash;774).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>27. In addition to the NEB review, Canada made the Project subject to Interim Measures for Pipeline Reviews that included an upstream greenhouse gas assessment and a Ministerial Panel that engaged local and Indigenous communities through 44 public meetings, 20,000 email submissions and 35,000 responses to an online questionnaire.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Love Affidavit, Ex. 99 (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2666&ndash;2669); Panel Report, pp. 2-3 (AB, Vol. 4, pp. 1395-1396).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. In its report, the Ministerial Panel summarized a variety of community perspectives and noted that, while some First Nations provided meaningful input, there were gaps in the process because &ldquo;First Nations such as the Squamish ... are firmly opposed to the project and ... have chosen to pursue their interests in the courts or pursue direct discussions with the Crown rather than engage at this level&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panel Report, p. 40 (AB, Vol. 4, p. 1433).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>

<P>47. In the First OIC, the GIC accepted the NEB's recommendation and directed it to issue a CPCN subject to the Federal Conditions.

<P>50. In their Reasons for Decision (&ldquo;<BOLD>RMD</BOLD>&rdquo;), the BC Ministers identified considerable provincial benefits of the Project, acknowledged the concerns the Province raised during the NEB process, but were satisfied that the Federal Conditions, BC Conditions and regulatory requirements would mitigate spill risks.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMD, pp. 4&ndash;8 (AR, pp. 137&ndash;141).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>51.

<P>52. Then Premier Christy Clark was satisfied that the Project met her &ldquo;five conditions&rdquo; to support a heavy oil pipeline, including world-leading spill response and BC's &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; of fiscal and economic benefits. Regarding the latter, Premier Clark identified 75,110 person-years of employment, $19.1 billion in BC GDP over 20 years, approximately $2.2 billion in BC tax revenue, $512 million in municipal property taxes, and up to $1 billion in direct payments from TM's then parent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Love Affidavit, Ex. 125 (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2698&ndash;2704).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>L.</N><TI>The BCSC Upheld the Entire Provincial Regulatory Review</TI>
<P>53. Squamish sought judicial review of the EAC, arguing that the Province's consultation was inadequate.

<P>54. Grauer J. dismissed Squamish's Petition. Based on an extensive evidentiary record, Grauer J. found as fact that the Province's consultation on issues of provincial jurisdiction was adequate. The Province grappled with, considered, and engaged in a two-way dialogue regarding Squamish's concerns, and proposed a number of additional conditions to address potential impacts on Indigenous interests. Consultation did not require that BC correct perceived shortfalls in the NEB process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 127&ndash;200 (AR, pp. 114&ndash;132).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. Concurrently, Grauer J. dismissed a similar judicial review by the City of Vancouver on administrative law grounds.

<P>57. The FCA dismissed <UNDER>all</UNDER> but one asserted flaw regarding the NEB process and recommendations, finding that the NEB unjustifiably excluded Project-related marine shipping from part of its CEAA 2012 review. Nevertheless, the FCA found that the NEB adequately assessed the scope and significance of the effects of Project-related marine shipping. As a result, the FCA ordered that the GIC direct the NEB to conduct a limited reconsideration of Project-related marine shipping to address distinct CEAA 2012 and <EM>Species at Risk Act</EM> requirements; namely, alternative means of carrying out Project&mdash;related marine shipping and measures that are technically and economically feasible and would mitigate the already identified, significant adverse environmental effects of Project&mdash;related marine shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 439-440, 456, 469-470, 764&ndash;766, 769-770.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. Notably, the FCA rejected Squamish's administrative and constitutional arguments that the NEB and Canada unlawfully deferred the collection of Project information to Federal Conditions. The FCA found that this argument overlooked the NEB's legislated lifecycle regulation, including oversight of condition compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 278&ndash;291, 335&ndash;351, 542&ndash;547.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

However, the FCA found that Canada's execution of Phase III was unreasonable because: (i) Canada's consultation representatives were mere &ldquo;note-takers&rdquo;; (ii) Canada was unwilling to depart from the NEB's findings and recommendations; and, (iii) Canada believed it was unable to impose additional conditions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 552&ndash;562.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The FCA also found that Canada's late delivery of its Project impact assessment contributed to, but was not a main factor in, consultation inadequacy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 638&ndash;648.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>60. The issues on appeal are:
<P1>(a) What is the Province's jurisdiction over the Project and marine shipping?</P1>
<P1>(b) Are flaws in the NEB's marine shipping assessment relevant to the EAC?</P1>
<P1>(c) Did the Province adequately consult regarding the EAC?</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3. ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Standard of Review is Reasonableness</TI>
<P>61. TM agrees that this Court must determine whether Grauer J. correctly identified and applied the standard of review by focusing, in effect, on the administrative decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 36</CITE><PARANUM>45-46</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. The required depth of consultation is reviewed on a correctness standard.

Therefore, the only issue is adequacy of consultation.</P>
<P>63. The Court must determine whether the consultation process, viewed as a whole, resulted in &ldquo;reasonable efforts to inform and consult&rdquo;. Neither perfect satisfaction nor agreement is required. The duty to consult does not provide Aboriginal groups with a &ldquo;veto&rdquo; over final Crown decisions; it is reciprocal. Good faith participation is required on both sides. Sometimes, the Crown must make a decision in the face of disagreement as to the adequacy of mitigation measures.

<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Limited Provincial Jurisdiction over Interprovincial/International Transport</TI>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Constitutional Context of the Provincial Assessment</EM></TI>
<P>64. This appeal arises within a specific constitutional context: the Province's obligations to assess and consult regarding an interprovincial undertaking and related marine shipping activities. In this context, the Province was constrained by both the constitutional division of powers and the duty to consult.</P>
<P>65. Grauer J. recognized the importance of this constitutional context, finding that the Province was only required to consult within its legislative jurisdiction under the <EM>Constitution Act, 1867</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 136, 158 (AR, pp. 116, 122).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Specifically, Grauer J. noted that: (i) the BC Ministers had to issue an EAC; but, (ii) pursuant to provincial jurisdiction to regulate the environment within provincial boundaries, the BC Ministers had the authority to impose EAC conditions; subject to, (iii) the constitutional doctrines of interjurisdictional immunity and federal paramountcy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 7&ndash;9 (AR, p. 76).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province's duty to consult was triggered by the application for an EAC, not the broader federal decision to proceed with the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 158&ndash;162 (AR, pp. 122-123).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>66. It is within this constitutional framework that the EAO and BC Ministers considered the Project. They recognized that: (i) &ldquo;the Project is a primarily federally-regulated undertaking&rdquo;; (ii) &ldquo;any [EAC] condition cannot conflict with federal law or federally legally imposed requirements, or frustrate their purpose&rdquo;; (iii) &ldquo;[p]ipeline safety is primarily managed and regulated through the NEB&rdquo;; and, (iv) &ldquo;marine spill response remains a responsibility of the federal government and the certified response organization&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMD, pp. 1, 5 (AR, pp. 134, 138).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>67. This Court must assess each of the issues raised by Squamish in this appeal with reference to this constitutional context.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Scope of Provincial Jurisdiction</EM></TI>
<P>68. Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial undertakings (including pipelines and integrated facilities) and marine navigation and shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Constitution Act, 1867</EM>, ss. 91(10), 91(29), 92(10)(a).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The framers' purpose in assigning this jurisdiction to Parliament was to unify the colonies and secure the economic and political viability of the country as a whole.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Lafarge Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 23</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Lafarge</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), para. 31; <CASEREF><SOC>Consolidated Fastfrate Inc. v. Western Canada Council of Teamsters</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>36&ndash;39</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>69. However, the framers did not specifically assign environmental jurisdiction to either level of government. As a result, each of Parliament and the provincial legislatures have constitutional authority over the environment, with their respective jurisdictions limited to environmental issues under their respective heads of power.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport)</SOC><CITE>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 3</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Oldman River</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), pp. 63&ndash;68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. There are three powerful limits to the Province's environmental jurisdiction.</P>
<P>71. First, the Province cannot use its environmental jurisdiction to invade areas of federal jurisdiction unconnected to a provincial head of power. For example, the Province is &ldquo;constitutionally incapable of enacting legislation authorizing an interference with navigation ... [because] [e]verything connected with navigation and shipping seems to have been carefully confided to the Dominion Parliament&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Oldman River</EM>, p. 56, citing (in part) <CASEREF><SOC>Queddy River Driving Boom Co. v.

<P>73. Third, federal paramountcy renders inoperative any provincial law that conflicts with federal law. A conflict arises where either: (i) it is impossible to comply with both laws; or, (ii) although it is possible to comply with both laws, the operation of the provincial law frustrates the purpose of the federal enactment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Alberta (Attorney General) v.

<P>74. In <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, the BCSC found that the Province could not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the NGP, but could say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; with additional conditions, so long as those additional conditions did not trigger interjurisdictional immunity or federal paramountcy.

<P>75.

<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The NEB's Reconsideration is a Narrow Marine Shipping Review</EM></TI>
<P>77.

<P>78. The FCA found a single flaw in the NEB's review: the exclusion of marine shipping from its CEAA 2012 review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In particular, the FCA was concerned that this exclusion resulted in the NEB: (i) omitting from its review alternative shipping routes and technically and economically feasible mitigation measures to avoid the impacts of Project-related marine shipping; and, (ii) improperly concluding under CEAA 2012 that the Project will not have significant adverse environmental effects; and, (iii) as a result, not determining whether those effects are justified.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 411, 456, 469-470.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nevertheless, the FCA found the NEB assessment to be adequate to inform the GIC about the effects of Project-related shipping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, para. 468.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. As a result of the FCA decision, the GIC ordered the NEB to reconsider, within 155 calendar days, its marine shipping assessment to take into account environmental effects under CEAA 2012 and avoidance and mitigation measures on listed wildlife species (namely, the SRKW) under the <EM>Species at Risk Act</EM> (&ldquo;<BOLD>SARA</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order in Council P.C. 2018-1177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>80. That process has already begun. The NEB's List of Issues for the Reconsideration Hearing include: (i) the environmental effects of Project-related shipping; (ii) marine shipping mitigation measures that are technically and economically feasible; (iii) alternative means of carrying out Project-related marine shipping; (iv) follow-up program requirements; and, (v) measures to avoid or lessen adverse effects of Project-related marine shipping on SARA-listed wildlife species and their critical habitat.

<P>81. Consistent with the FCA's finding that the NEB's previous assessment of the environmental effects of marine shipping was adequate, the NEB noted that the issue had already been &ldquo;thoroughly canvassed .... and may not require additional evidence&rdquo;. Further, the NEB noted that mitigation measures will focus on the significant adverse effects of Project-related marine shipping contained in the NEB's original assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Letter dated September 26, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Province Lacks Constitutional Authority over Marine Shipping</EM></TI>
<P>82. Project-related marine shipping falls under Parliament's exclusive jurisdiction over navigation and shipping.

<P>83. This contrasts starkly with the federal jurisdiction over marine shipping. Indeed, it was the GIC's broad authority over the marine environment that led the FCA to find that the NEB erred by omitting Project-related marine shipping from the &ldquo;designated project&rdquo; notwithstanding the NEB's lack of authority to regulate marine shipping. In other words, while the NEB's regulatory authority was limited, the GIC's was not.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, para. 456.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>84. Parliament has enacted a marine regulatory regime supported by more than 100 regulations enabled by almost 30 statutes as well as international agreements and commitments. TC, with the support of other federal agencies such as the Coast Guard, is responsible for ensuring the regime is comprehensive, addressing safety, environmental preparedness and response, oversight, enforcement and liability.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Canada, &ldquo;Our response to British Columbia's Policy Intentions Paper for Engagement: Activities related to spill management&rdquo;; TC, &ldquo;Submission to the National Energy Board Review Panel For the Trans Mountain Expansion Project&rdquo; (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2511 -2577); <EM>Canada Shipping Act, 2001</EM>, S.C. 2001, c. 26; <EM>Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations</EM>, SOR/2012-69; <EM>Marine Liability Act</EM>, S.C. 2001, c. 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>85.

<P>86. Squamish does not delineate or provide any authority for provincial jurisdiction over marine shipping. Instead, it grounds its entire argument on what it perceives as the Province &ldquo;expressly asserting]&rdquo; jurisdiction over the environmental impacts of marine shipping because the BC Ministers considered it in the Reasons for Decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Squamish Factum, para. 72, referencing RMD, pp. 2-5 (AR, p. 135&ndash;138).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>87. Whether the Province &ldquo;asserted&rdquo; jurisdiction is irrelevant. In any event, the Province did no such thing. To the contrary, it carefully declined to assert jurisdiction.</P>
<P>88. The Project Lead carefully limited the scope of EAO review to the &ldquo;proposed Project&rdquo;: namely, the expansion and reactivation of the Pipeline and the new and modified facilities within BC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 10(1)(c) Order, paras. A, D (AB, Vol. 5, p. 1668); S. 11 Order, paras. A, D, Schedule A, s. 1 (&ldquo;Proposed Project&rdquo;) (AB, Vol. 5, pp. 1679, 1681).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Likewise, the BC Ministers in their Project Description described the &ldquo;Project authorized by this [EAC]&rdquo; as the expanded and reactivated Pipeline, pump stations, terminals and temporary construction infrastructure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Certified Project Description (AB, Vol. 12, p. 4704&ndash;4708).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They did so because tanker transit and marine spill response falls under federal jurisdiction, while the Province has some limited jurisdiction under its provincial land powers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAO Report, pp. 5, 16, 18 (AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2086, 2097, 2099); RMD, p. 5 (AR, p. 138).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>89. The Project Lead and the BC Ministers recognized that marine spills can negatively impact BC's coastal lands, and that the Province has a role in coastal emergency response. Therefore, it was important to align regulatory processes for federal marine response and joint federal/provincial land response.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAO Report, p. 18 (AB, Vol. 6, p. 2099); RMD, p. 5 (AR, p. 138).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, the BC Conditions related to the marine environment are informational and deal with coastal geographic response planning and shoreline clean-up.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>BC Conditions 11, 34, 35 (AR, pp. 150, 162).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>90. Certainly, for both the EAO and the BC Ministers, marine shipping was an issue of &ldquo;provincial interest&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>EAO Report, p. 10 (AB, Vol. 6, p. 2091); RMD, p. 2 (AR, p. 135).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, given the constitutional limitations on the Province's ability to impact marine shipping activities, their jurisdiction was seriously constrained. In any event, through the NEB's adequate assessment of the environmental effects of Project-related marine shipping, the Province had the information it required to impose mitigation measures.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>The Province Met Its Duty to Consult</TI>
<P>91. Squamish argues that the Province failed to meet its duty to consult because it: (i) relied on the NEB assessment without considering further EAO assessment; (ii) coordinated its consultation process with Canada's Phase III, which the FCA found to be inadequate; and, (iii) relied on aspects of the NEB assessment that it criticized during the NEB hearing. Additionally, Squamish argues that Grauer J. erred by assessing consultation with reference to the Province's limited legislative jurisdiction.</P>
<P>92. For the reasons that follow, each of these arguments must fail.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Province's Duty to Consult regarding Federal Projects</EM></TI>
<P>93. The Province's constitutional boundaries are critical to assessing the adequacy of its consultation. This is because the Crown's duty to consult is triggered where it has real or constructive knowledge of a potential Aboriginal claim or right and <UNDER>contemplates conduct that may adversely affect it.</UNDER> The content of the duty falls along a spectrum ranging from limited to deep consultation, depending on the strength of the Aboriginal claim and <UNDER>the seriousness of the potential impact on the right</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haida</EM>, paras. 35, 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>94. Grauer J. recognized that the duty to consult &ldquo;does not alter the constitutional division of powers between the federal and provincial arms of government&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 136 (AR, p. 116).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province was only obligated to consult, and discuss potential accommodation, in relation to provincial heads of power (here, the determination of conditions within provincial jurisdiction that should be imposed on the EAC).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 160-162 (AR, p. 122-123).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Province was further constrained by the doctrines of interjurisdictional immunity and federal paramountcy.</P>
<P>95. Canada, as the primary regulator and final decision-maker, did not face the same constraints. Indeed, the GIC could have rejected the Project, required changes to Project design and marine shipping routes, required the NEB review further information or, according to the FCA, imposed additional conditions beyond the jurisdiction of the NEB. Therefore, the GIC decision required consultation on a broader area of topics.</P>
<P>96. Grauer J.'s reasoning is neither novel nor controversial. The Federal Court applied similar reasoning regarding a primarily provincially regulated oil sands project. The Court found that Canada was not required to consult and accommodate on matters within provincial jurisdiction; that duty was reserved for the province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Adam v. Canada (Environment)</SOC><CITE>2014 FC 1185</CITE><PARANUM>78, 83, 91&ndash;94, 105</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here, the Province was similarly not required to consult and accommodate on matters within federal jurisdiction.</P>
<P>97. Squamish seeks to apply the duty to consult absent a consideration of the constitutional division of powers. Such an approach is improper, contrary to precedent and ought to be rejected.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Province Understood that it could Order Further Assessment</EM></TI>
<P>98. Squamish, referring to an EAO letter, argues that the Province wrongly saw itself as constrained by the Equivalency Agreement from ordering further assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Squamish Factum, paras. 77&ndash;81.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, Squamish fails to note that the same EAO letter <UNDER>expressly</UNDER> states that: &ldquo;based on the information available to Ministers, one option for them under the <EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM> <UNDER>is to order that further assessment be carried out</UNDER>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Braun Affidavit, Ex. P, p. 3 (AB, Vol. 13, p. 5219).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The BC Ministers clearly believed that they had the authority to order further assessment; indeed, they also referenced s. 17(3) of the <EM>Act</EM>, which includes the authority to order further assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMD, p. 1 (AR, p. 134).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>99. Squamish's real complaint is not that the Province misunderstood that it could order further assessment, it is that the Province declined to order further assessment. Contrary to Squamish's argument, this is either a purely administrative law issue or an issue of consultation adequacy. Either way, the standard of review is reasonableness.</P>
<P>100. Grauer J. found the Province's approach to be reasonable. He noted that further assessment &ldquo;was constitutionally feasible, depending on its extent, but given the Equivalency Agreement, would have been largely redundant and wasteful of resources given the provincial Crown's opportunity to consult and attach project conditions after completion of the NEB process&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 161 (AR, p. 123).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supreme Court of Canada agrees: equivalency agreements &ldquo;reduce unnecessary, costly and inefficient duplication&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>MiningWatch Canada v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans)</SOC><CITE>2010 SCC 2</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>101. Regardless of whether the BC Ministers ordered further assessment, the Province could&mdash;and did&mdash;address its concerns through conditions. Through conditions, consultation continues.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, para. 170 (AR, p. 125); Braun Affidavit, para. 62 (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2728 -2729).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, any additional assessment cannot impair the timely operation of the Project or impose informational requirements that the NEB and the GIC considered but declined to impose prior to Project approval.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Rogers</EM>, paras. 5, 66, 71-72, 120; NEB Reasons MO-057-2017, pp. 24-25; <EM>Lafarge</EM>, paras. 75&ndash;85; <EM>Bank of Montreal</EM>, pp. 151&ndash;155; <EM>Mangat</EM>, para. 72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>102. Squamish's preferred outcome would have been to cancel the Equivalency Agreement for the Project. However, the Equivalency Agreement is of general application. If cancelled, it is cancelled for all projects. In this context, it is logical and reasonable that the EAO accepted the NEB assessment as equivalent while acknowledging the BC Ministers could order further assessment as permissible under provincial jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Province's Consultation Does not Fall with Canada's Phase III</EM></TI>
<P>103. Squamish argues that because the Province jointly consulted with Canada during Phase III, unlawful deficiencies in Canada's consultation process must also be attributed to the Province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Squamish Factum, paras. 82&ndash;84.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This argument must fail because it ignores key differences between the provincial and federal consultation processes.</P>
<P>104. The FCA required Canada conduct a &ldquo;brief and efficient&rdquo; redo of Phase III because its representatives were mere &ldquo;note-takers&rdquo;, relied unwaveringly on the NEB assessment and recommendations and thought they were bound by proposed Federal Conditions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, paras. 557&ndash;562.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>105. None of these flaws were present during the Province's consultation. Further, while the Province coordinated some of its consultation with Canada, it expressly limited its obligations to consult and accommodate to areas of provincial jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit #1, Ex. E (AB, Vol. 1, pp. 74&ndash;76); Braun Affidavit, Ex. G, K (AB, Vol. 12, pp. 4709-4710, 4716&ndash;4734); S. 11 Order, paras. 4.1.2, 4.1.3. 4.1.5 (AB, Vol. 5, pp. 1682-1683).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>106. The majority of the Province's consultation was carried out directly by the Project Lead. Far from a mere &ldquo;note-taker&rdquo;, the Project Lead proposed 37 BC Conditions, which were in addition to and built incrementally on the Federal Conditions. The Project Lead developed these BC Conditions based in part on his consultation with&mdash;and input from&mdash;Indigenous groups, including Squamish.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Braun Affidavit, paras. 1, 23&ndash;62 (AB, Vol. 7, pp. 2711, 2717&ndash;2729); S. 11 Order, ss. 3-8 (AB, Vol. 5, pp. 1682&ndash;1685).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>107. Grauer J. found as fact that the Project Lead: (i) &ldquo;grappled with [Squamish's] concerns and considered them, and ... engaged in a two-way dialogue&rdquo;; and, (ii) &ldquo;proposed a number of additional conditions, several of which were intended to address potential impacts&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 153&ndash;157 (AR, pp. 120&ndash;122).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is precisely what the FCA found that Canada did not do.</P>
<P>108. The BC Ministers adopted the Project Lead's proposed conditions. Unlike Canada's consultation representatives, the Project Lead had the confidence of the BC Ministers as required by the FCA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>TWN 2018</EM>, para. 759.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>109. Further, the Project Lead engaged with Squamish in the type of meaningful, two&mdash;way dialogue contemplated by the FCA. By way of example, in a letter dated December 8, 2016, the Project Lead responded to Squamish's comments on the proposed BC Conditions, noting limits to the Province's constitutional authority over marine shipping and its intent to build incrementally on the Federal Conditions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Braun Affidavit, Ex. P (AB, Vol. 13, pp. 5217&ndash;5222).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>110. Contrary to Squamish's argument, the Province's consultation process included more than an exchange of correspondence and two meetings. The uncontroverted facts are that the process included:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See references at footnote 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) requests for Squamish's input on the proposed consultation process;</P1>
<P1>(b) direct correspondence and meetings with the EAO Executive Director and Project Lead, who had the power to propose legally binding conditions;</P1>
<P1>(c) opportunities to comment on two draft versions of the CAR;</P1>
<P1>(d) revisions to draft versions of the CAR based on feedback from Squamish;</P1>
<P1>(e) access to strength of claim information;</P1>
<P1>(f) written submissions to the BC Ministers;</P1>
<P1>(g) explanations from the Project Lead when the EAO disagreed with Squamish's preferred accommodation and positions;</P1>
<P1>(h) BC Conditions that respond to Indigenous groups' concerns;</P1>
<P1>(i) extensive reasons in the CAR, EAO Report, Executive Director's recommendations and Reasons for Ministers' Decision;</P1>
<P1>(j) the opportunity to engage directly with TM; and,</P1>
<P1>(k) the opportunity to comment on TM's draft Aboriginal Engagement Report.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>(iv)</EM></N><TI><EM>There is no Duty to Consult Regarding Policy Positions</EM></TI>
<P>111. Grauer J. rejected Squamish's argument that the Province had a specific duty to explain why it did not require further information prior to issuing an EAC notwithstanding its position before the NEB that such information was required. The Province appeared before the NEB as an advocate; however, once the NEB made its recommendation and the GIC approved the Project &ldquo;the constitutional table was set&rdquo;. Grauer J. found that the Province &ldquo;was no longer advocating a position, but rather was dealing with a federal decision that it was constitutionally constrained from impairing or frustrating&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, paras. 174&ndash;179 (AR, pp. 126-127).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>112. Squamish argues that this finding is flawed. It asserts that the Province was required to inform Squamish why it would issue an EAC without requiring TM to provide the information the Province unsuccessfully sought before the NEB. This argument must fail. The Province did not have the constitutional authority to order further assessment of an issue on which the NEB explicitly declined to order further assessment. This would be a clear frustration of the purpose of the NEB's authority.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lafarge</EM>, paras. 75-85; <EM>Bank of Montreal</EM>, pp. 151&ndash;155; <EM>Mangat</EM>, para. 72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>113. In any event, the Province will receive further information on the Project through the BC Conditions. For instance, in BC Condition 35, the Province required TM to provide a report on its current and future research programs regarding the behaviour and recovery of spilled oil.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>BC Condition 35 (AR, p. 26).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This BC Condition complements the NEB's finding that the results of ongoing research should continue to inform spill response planning, but that sufficient evidence was on the record to support the assessment of potential spill-related effects and spill response planning.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>NEB Report at pp. 136-137 (AB, Volume 3, pp. 911-12).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>114. In any event, the Province <EM>did</EM> explain to Squamish&mdash;through both letters and its approval documentation&mdash;why it issued the EAC without requesting further information. For example, the Project Lead noted that the proposed BC Conditions built incrementally on the Federal Conditions and addressed the Province's concerns. The BC Ministers also identified the BC Conditions, federal and provincial legislative changes, and the OPP as reasons for finding that Project spills would be mitigated to an acceptable level.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Braun Affidavit, Ex.

<P>115. Squamish argues that even if the Province was subject to constitutional constraints, it failed to inform Squamish of those constraints.</P>
<P>116. Squamish's argument is unfounded. The Project Lead repeatedly informed Squamish that the Province was consulting only on &ldquo;areas of provincial jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Campbell Affidavit #1, Ex.

<P>120. Here, the most just remedy is a declaration and limited stay of the EAC on traditional Squamish territory until consultation with Squamish on areas within provincial jurisdiction is complete. The reasons for this are: (i) primary jurisdiction lies with Canada; (ii) the BC Ministers have limited jurisdiction to impose complementary conditions; (iii) Squamish is the only Indigenous group that challenged the EAC; (iv) Squamish did not apply to stay the EAC; (v) the territory over which Squamish asserts rights and title represents only a small portion of the Project, which may only be impacted years from now; and, (vi) the Project is in the Canadian public interest. TM submits that this remedy is proportional, just and will advance reconciliation.</P>
<P>121. All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>
<P>Dated at the City of Calgary, Province of Alberta, this 7<SUP>th</SUP> day of November of 2018</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>This Court is put in the &ldquo;unusual, if not awkward, position&rdquo; of having to consider the discharge of the provincial Crown's duty to consult on the Environmental Assessment Certificate issued by the Ministers for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in the face of the Federal Court of Appeal decision setting aside the federal approval of the Project due to scoping errors in the National Energy Board Report and a breach of the federal consultation duty. The Attorney General appears to speak to two issues: (1) the impact, if any, on the EAC of the scoping errors given that the Ministers, pursuant to a federal/provincial Equivalency Agreement, had relied upon the NEB Report in their considerations; and (2) the impact, if any, on the provincial Certificate of the failure of the federal Crown to meet is consultation obligations.</P>
<P>In respect to the first issue, this Court is not bound to allow the appeal and set aside the EAC on the basis of the scoping errors in the National Energy Board Report. Absent administrative or constitutional limitations, section 37 of the <EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM> provides a complete code with respect to the circumstances under which an Environmental Assessment Certificate can be cancelled or suspended; the scoping errors did not fall within this section. In addition, the scoping errors in the National Energy Board Report led to the failure of <EM>federal</EM> decision makers to properly discharge their obligations under <EM>federal</EM> statutes with respect to areas of <EM>federal</EM> responsibilities: the <EM>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</EM> and the <EM>Species at Risk Act</EM>. Therefore, the deficiencies found by the Federal Court of Appeal do not automatically make the NEB Report insufficient for the purposes of reliance by the Ministers in their decision to issue an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the Project.</P>
<P>In respect of the second issue, the <UNDER>provincial</UNDER> consultation, despite being part of the joint consultation process, was different in form and content from Canada's, such that the decision of the chambers judge that the Province fulfilled its duty to consult and satisfied the honour of the Crown should not be disturbed.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The respondent does not object to the facts as set out by the appellants save as amended by the facts set out below.</P>
<P>2. In the Court below, Grauer J. noted that it was not for him to decide whether the federal Crown fulfilled its duty in relation to the National Energy Board (&ldquo;NEB&rdquo;) hearings and the federal cabinet decision to approve the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment, <CASEREF><SOC>Squamish Nation v British Columbia (Environment)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 844</CITE><PARANUM>71</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;RFJ&rdquo;); Appeal Record (&ldquo;AR&rdquo;), Tab 5, pp. 89-90; Respondent Attorney General of British Columbia Book of Authorities (&ldquo;AG BoA&rdquo;), Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. Nonetheless, Grauer J. found that both the NEB and federal cabinet processes played significant roles in the provincial &ldquo;... environmental assessment process, with the NEB review constituting the required assessment under the <EM>EAA</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM>, SBC 2002, c. 43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>[<EM>Environmental Assessment Act</EM>] pursuant to the Equivalency Agreement.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 72, AR Tab 5, p. 90; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. The Government of Canada relied upon the NEB review process &ldquo;to the extent possible&rdquo; to meet the federal duty to consult, and the Province followed a similar approach, coordinating consultation with the federal Crown and making use of the federal consultation record that preceded the Province's regulatory involvement in the environmental assessment process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 73, AR Tab 5, p. 90; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. The Province's consultation process dovetailed with the federal government's Phase III process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 86, AR Tab 5, p. 94; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. On April 1, 2016 the Environmental Assessment Office's (&ldquo;EAO&rdquo;) Executive Project Director, Mr. Braun, advised the appellants that, given the decision in <EM>Coastal First</EM> Nations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Coastal First Nations v British Columbia (Environment)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 34</CITE></CASEREF> (<EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>), AG BoA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) would require an Environmental Assessment Certificate (&ldquo;EAC&rdquo;) (s. 10 Order).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 87, AR Tab 5, p. 94; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. On May 9, 2016, Mr. Braun wrote to the Squamish Nation, providing a draft s. 11 order under the <EM>EAA</EM> (defining the scope of the required assessment of the reviewable project, and the procedures and methods for conducting the assessment) and advising the appellants that the EAO would &ldquo;coordinate Aboriginal consultation activities&rdquo; with other provincial agencies and Canada. The Squamish Nation was further advised that the EAO would still be communicating directly with Aboriginal groups in the future to provide information &ldquo;on the specific next steps in the provincial consultative process, including regarding any coordinated consultation activities with the federal government&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 88, AR Tab 5, p. 95; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. Mr. Braun went on to outline consultation opportunities for the appellants, as well as what procedural aspects of Aboriginal consultation would be delegated to Trans Mountain.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RJF at para. 89, AR Tab 5, p. 95; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. In a letter dated May 24, 2016, Squamish Nation's Chief Williams raised an issue central to this case&mdash;the Province's reliance on NEB Report, which the appellants felt was deficient.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 90, AR Tab 5, p. 96; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Mr. Braun responded to the May 24<SUP>th</SUP> letter noting that the <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> decision upheld the validity of the Equivalency Agreement, save for the provision removing the EAC requirement. Grauer J. noted that Mr. Braun did not answer the two questions that were raised: how could the Province rely on the NEB Report when i t had previously taken the position that the NEB process was inadequate; and why did the Province not consult with Squamish about not terminating the Equivalency Agreement?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 91, AR Tab 5, p. 96; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. On June 17, 2016, after considering feedback on the draft s. 11 order, Mr. Braun issued the order which set out the procedures for the environmental assessment process for the Project. It provided that the NEB Report would be equivalent to the ss. 27 and 28 assessment and to the assessment report required under 17(2) of the EAA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 92, AR Tab 5, p. 96; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Schedule B to the s. 11 order listed the Aboriginal groups to be consulted at the deeper end of spectrum. This included the appellants, and listed consultation opportunities which included: notification; opportunities to discuss and comment on issues rasied at NEB panel review or in further consultations; opportunities to review and comment on supplemental materials and to meet to discuss both the materials and potential Project impacts; and an opportunity to make submissions to the EAO which would be included in the materials provided to the Ministers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 93, AR Tab 5, p. 97; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. On June 23, 2016, representatives from the Province met with the appellants and another Aboriginal group to discuss their concerns with the EAO's reliance on the NEB assessment. In a follow-up letter dated August 24, 2016, the two First Nations reiterated their concerns that the process was inadequate for proper assessment of the Project's impacts on their interests.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 94, AR Tab 5, p. 98; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. In July 2016, Trans Mountain filed its Aboriginal Engagement Report, indicating that the appellants had advised Trans Mountain that they only wanted consultation with the Crown.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 95, AR Tab 5, p. 98; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Trans Mountain went on to address issues raised by the appellants in the Traditional Land Use report submitted to NEB, including salmon harvesting, protection of culturally important and surface waters, protection of burial sites, loss of access due to increased shipping, effects of dredging on marine habitat and effects on marine mammals, especially killer whales. The appellants were also concerned with threats to their marine-based economic interests and the lack of an adequate spill response plan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 96, AR Tab 5, p. 98; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. On August 17, 2016, the federal and provincial Crowns (through the federal Major Projects Management Office and the EAO) provided the appellants with an early draft of the Joint Federal/Provincial Consultation and Accommodation Report (&ldquo;CCAR&rdquo;) released in November 2016, for review, asking for comments to &ldquo;ensure that the report reflected the view of the Squamish community&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 98, AR Tab 5, p. 99; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The draft CCAR included a draft Appendix C.4 specific to the Squamish Nation, providing background strength of claim information, a summary of the appellants' involvement in the regulatory review and consultation for the Project, key interests and concerns, potential impacts as raised by the appellants and applicable mitigation and accommodation measures identified in the review process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 99, AR Tab 5, p. 99; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The preliminary strength of claim assessment ranged from weak near the terminal in Burnaby to moderate to moderate-to weak in the marine shipping corridor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 100, AR Tab 5, p. 100; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. On September 19, 2016, the appellants responded to the August 17<SUP>th</SUP> letter, claiming that the draft CCAR &ldquo;repackages information that Squamish has already determined is inadequate&rdquo;, and outlined their outstanding concerns regarding information gaps and need for further studies.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 101, AR Tab 5, p. 100; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. The Province and Canada responded to this letter on October 6, 2016, in a joint letter acknowledging the appellants' concerns and requests but stating the Crown view that substantive concerns had been addressed in the review process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at paras. 102-103, AR Tab 5, p. 100-101; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. The final meeting between the parties took place on October 18, 2016. The meeting record was reviewed at length by the Court below as an indication of the substantive discussion that occurred.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 104, AR Tab 5, p. 101; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On November 3, 2016, the Province and Canada sent the revised CCAR to the appellants along with a package of additional documentation, including a substantive review of issues and concerns raised by the appellants regarding the process and the impact of the Project on their rights. The CCAR stated that &ldquo;both governments have relied on the NEB Review to assess and seek to minimize, to the degree possible, the potential adverse impacts of the Project on Aboriginal rights, title and interests, thereby supporting the Crown's broader duty to consult obligations&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at paras. 107-108, AR Tab 5, p. 103; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. Chief Campbell responded by letter dated November 14, 2016 and reiterated the appellant's concerns that there was no provincial review independent of the &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; NEB process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at paras. 109-110, AR Tab 5, p. 104; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. On November 28, 2016, British Columbia and Canada responded to the November 14<SUP>th</SUP> letter, advising Chief Campbell that his comments had been added to the CCAR and shared with federal ministers, and would be shared with the provincial Ministers. The federal and provincial Crowns advised that a decision on the EAC was expected to follow shortly after the federal decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 111, AR Tab 5, p. 105; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. On December 8, 2016, after Governor in Council (&ldquo;GiC&rdquo;) approval for the Project, Mr. Braun, separately, wrote to the appellants to respond to Chief Campbell's comments in the November 14<SUP>th</SUP> letter. Mr. Braun referenced the provincial process and referral materials, and addressed the draft conditions proposed in the EAC regarding oil spill containment and recovery, emergency response plans, and research on the fate and behaviour of diluted bitumen.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 112, AR Tab 5, p. 105; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. On January 10, 2017, the Ministers issued an EAC to Trans Mountain, subject to 37 conditions. The Court below appended to the decision the full text of the Reasons and Table of Conditions and excerpted in the body of the decision extensive segments of the Ministers' reasons dealing with: the nature and scope of the decision; the Ministers' considerations based on the EAO's Assessment and the Recommendations of the Executive Director; Key Considerations expressing the Ministers' concerns with spill impacts, as well as Project impacts on vegetation, wildlife and protected areas; terrestrial and marine spills; Aboriginal consultation; and the Ministers' views that the Crown's duty to consult and accommodate had been met. Ultimately the Ministers concluded, after listing all the materials considered&mdash;the NEB Report, CCAR, EAO's summary assessment report, proposed Project design, recommendations of the Executive Director, and the 37 proposed conditions and having regard to the Crown's constitutional duty to consult&mdash;that they would issue the EAC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at paras. 114&ndash;121 AR Tab 5, p. 106&ndash;112; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The Court below found that the appellants accepted that &ldquo;it was not open to the Ministers to refuse to issue an EAC&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 122, AR Tab 5, p. 112; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK1>

Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 FCA 153</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;FCA Decision&rdquo;), AG BoA Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;FCA&rdquo;), in declaring the NEB Report inadequate for federal purposes and nullifying federal approval of the Project, means that the NEB Report is also insufficient to support the provincial Ministers' decision to issue an EAC. They say this is so as the NEB Report served as the provincial environmental assessment report for the purposes of the provincial EAC. The Attorney General submits that the Ministers turned their minds to the aspects of environmental protection that they understood to be within provincial jurisdiction and imposed conditions in the EAC in relation to these matters within those areas of provincial competence. Consequently, the NEB's scoping error, which led to the failure of the GiC to properly discharge its duties under relevant federal legislation, namely the <EM>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SC 2012, c. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the <EM>Species at Risk Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SC 2002, c. 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> did not constrain the exercise of the provincial statutory power of decision under the provincial <EM>EAA</EM>.</P>
<P>29. The appellants argue that the chambers judge erred in finding that the Province fulfilled its duty to consult by relying on the NEB Report and &lsquo;piggy-backing&rsquo; on the deficient federal consultation process. The Attorney General submits that the provincial environmental assessment process was much more robust than the appellants suggest and, as found by the Court below, there were substantial differences between federal and provincial participation in the joint consultation process.</P>
<P>30. The appellants also argue that the chambers judge erred in not finding that the Province, in issuing the EAC, effectively changed its position from that taken at the NEB hearing, without consultation with the appellants. However, the law is clear that the Province's jurisdiction in regard to federal projects is limited to regulating matters within provincial jurisdiction, without going so far as to refuse to issue an EAC and attempt to block a federal project from proceeding. Rather, refusing to issue an EAC would just ensure there were no provincial conditions attached to the Project. The Ministers' EAC decision was made in the context of this legal reality rather than as an aspect of a reconsideration of any previous decision. Consequently, this ground of appeal is without merit and the EAC was properly found by the Court below to have been issued after adequate consultation in fulfilment of the honour of the Crown.</P>
<P>31. Finally, the appellants assert that the chambers judge fell into error in failing to determine that the provincial decision makers unreasonably constrained themselves by feeling bound to act only within the constitutional boundaries of their authority. Alternatively, the appellants argue, if the Ministers were obliged to restrain themselves only to actions within their constitutional capacity, they were obliged to consult with the appellants about that constraint. The Ministers acted within the law as set out in the <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> decision, which defined their ability to act as within areas of provincial interest. Consequently, the Court below made no error in observing that &ldquo;the &ldquo;constitutional reality&rdquo; is that the attachment of (Project) conditions was the only possible outcome of the provincial Crown's contemplated conduct&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 171, AR Tab 5, p. 125; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No duty to consult arose in such circumstances.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>A.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Scope of Review</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. The appellants, at paragraph 61 state that, &ldquo;[t]his Court's role in hearing an appeal from a decision on judicial review is to determine whether the judge below selected and correctly applied the appropriate standard of review, effectively stepping into that judge's shoes and focusing on the administrative decision.&rdquo;</P>
<P>33. This Court, in <CASEREF><SOC>Prophet River First Nation v. British Columbia (Environment)</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2017 BCCA 58</CITE></CASEREF>, AG BoA Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;<EM>Prophet River</EM>&rdquo;), most recently considered the scope of review. In that case, this Court &ldquo;focussing on whether the Crown's constitutional duty in that regard [consultation] has been properly discharged...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Prophet River</EM>, at para 47, AG BoA Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> found that:
<QUOTE><P>[48] While the notion of an appellate court stepping into the shoes of the reviewing judge has been applied to the extent of suggesting that, in considering the Crown's duty to consult and accommodate, it is necessary to &ldquo;re-do&rdquo; the judge's reasonableness analysis to see if the same conclusion is reached (<CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Long Plain First Nation</SOC><CITE>2015 FCA 177</CITE><PARANUM>93</PARANUM></CASEREF>), it appears to have been qualified with respect to what are clear findings of fact in <CASEREF><SOC>Hupacasath First Nation v. Canada (Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada)</SOC><CITE>2015 FCA 4</CITE></CASEREF>. There, on an appeal concerning the fulfillment of the Crown's duty of consultation and accommodation the following was stated:
<QUOTE><P>[75] <CASEREF><SOC>Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 2 S.C.R. 559</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2013 SCC 36</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> stands for the proposition that we are to stand in the shoes and consider whether the Federal Court properly applied the standard of review. I do not believe that this allows us to substitute our factual findings for those made by the Federal Court.</P>
<P>[76] In my view, as is the case in all areas of appellate review, absent some extricable legal principle, we are to defer to findings that are heavily suffused by the first instance court's appreciation of the evidence, not second-guess them. Only palpable and overriding error can vitiate such findings.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. This Court also found that the standard of reasonableness applies to whether the process of consultation and accommodation has been met.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Prophet River</EM>, at paras. 49, 52, AG BoA, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. The appellants argue that the chambers judge nonetheless fell into error in applying the standard of reasonableness rather than correctness, because, they assert, the scope of the Province's obligations was wrongly identified. The Attorney General says that the scope of the Province's consultation obligations is a question of mixed fact and law and subject to the reasonableness standard.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>B</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>The Scoping Errors in the NEB Report Do Not Undermine the Foundation of the EAC</UNDER></TI>
<P>36. The scoping errors identified by the FCA in the NEB Report were not before the Court below, nor did the appellants raise any other scoping issues. Be that as it may, the NEB Report and aspects of the joint federal/provincial consultation process have been found deficient by the FCA, raising the question of whether the NEB Report was sufficient to be relied upon by the Ministers.</P>
<P>37. The authority for the Ministers' decision to issue the EAC is found in the <EM>EAA</EM>. Absent administrative or constitutional limitations, section 37 of the <EM>EAA</EM> provides a complete code with respect to the circumstances under which an EAC can be cancelled or suspended, or where the Ministers could add additional conditions or amend existing ones<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>EAA</EM>, s. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. There is no provision or mechanism within s. 37 whereby a provincial official can rescind or revoke an EAC for a project on the basis that federal approval of the project has been set aside. Had the Legislature intended that ministers have the power to more broadly reconsider an EAC, those powers would have been set out explicitly. Therefore, as a matter of law, the EAC remains valid.</P>
<P>38. As a consequence, barring any grounds for the revocation or reconsideration of the EAC pursuant to the terms of the <UNDER>provincial</UNDER> <EM>EAA</EM>, the EAC will stand unless and until set aside by order of this Court, pursuant to this challenge under the <EM>Judicial Review Procedure Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSBC 1996, c. 241.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If the EAC were set aside, then the conditions attached to it would also be of no force or effect.</P>
<P>39. In addition, the <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> decision makes clear that the Project requires both federal and provincial environmental assessment reviews and approvals&mdash;that is, two separate, distinct and self-standing approvals. In <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, the court reviewed the Equivalency Agreement between the Crowns, which dealt with projects requiring both federal and provincial environmental reviews. The court held the Equivalency Agreement invalid to the extent that it purported to remove the need for such projects to obtain an EAC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> at paras. 180&ndash;183 and 214, AG BoA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Thus, while the EAO and the Ministers could still use an NEB Report as a <EM>provincial</EM> environmental assessment report, they did not have statutory authority to avoid the requirement under s. 17 of the <EM>EAA</EM> that the Province carry out its own EAC review process. The court also held that before making a s. 17 decision, the Province was required to consult with Indigenous groups about potential impacts of the project on areas of <EM>provincial</EM> jurisdiction and how those impacts could be accommodated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> at para. 68, AG BoA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. Consequently, while the NEB's scoping errors led to a situation in which <EM>federal</EM> decision-makers failed to properly discharge their obligations under <EM>federal</EM> statutes addressed to <EM>federal</EM> areas of responsibility, it is necessary to consider what the FCA said with respect to the NEB Report itself to determine the impact, if any, of the FCA Decision on the validity of the EAC.</P>
<P>41. First, the FCA dismissed the six applications for judicial review which challenged the NEB Report, on the basis that the NEB Report itself was not justiciable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>FCA Decision at para. 202, AG BoA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, the FCA found a reviewing court &ldquo;must be satisfied that the decision of the Governor in Council is lawful, reasonable and constitutionally valid. If the decision of the Governor in Council is based upon a materially flawed report, the decision may be set aside on that basis.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>FCA Decision at para. 201, AG BoA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, the NEB Report remains valid for use, via the Equivalency Agreement, as the <EM>provincial</EM> environmental assessment report.</P>
<P>42. It is true that pursuant to the Equivalency Agreement, the NEB Report also became &ldquo;... the provincial EA [Environmental Assessment] technical assessment report&rdquo; required under s. 17(2) of the EAA. In addition, the EAO provided the following materials to the Ministers to inform their s. 17 decision:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the Affidavit #1 of Nathan Braun (&ldquo;Braun #1&rdquo;), Joint Appeal Book (&ldquo;AB&rdquo;), Vol. 7, p. 2730.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P>43. The EAO's 37 proposed conditions (all of which were accepted) were intended to respond to &ldquo;concerns ... raised by communities and Aboriginal groups during consultation, and to the key areas of provincial interest and jurisdiction&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 107, AR Tab 5, p. 103; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. The Ministers agreed with the Executive Director of the EAO that &ldquo;<EM>with the addition of the proposed EA conditions</EM> the potential adverse impacts on areas of provincial interest and jurisdiction would be avoided, minimized or otherwise accommodated to an acceptable level&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, at para. 117, AR Tab 5, p. 107; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (emphasis added)</P>
<P>44. Consequently, the provincial decision-makers, in addition to the NEB Report, had the additional information flowing from this expanded environmental review process. They then turned their minds to the aspects of environmental protection that they understood to be within provincial jurisdiction and attached the proposed conditions, including those highlighted below, to the EAC:
<P1><UNDER>a) Marine Environment:</UNDER> Many of the concerns identified by the appellants related to the marine environment. However, the EAO developed conditions to supplement, to the extent possible, the NEB conditions related to marine shipping and potential accidents or malfunctions in the marine environment. In particular, EAC condition 34 requires Trans Mountain to participate in coastal geographic response planning upon request. EAC condition 35 requires Trans Mountain to provide a report (in consultation with Indigenous groups) regarding its current and future research programs regarding the fate and behaviour of bitumen in water.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;EEEE&rdquo; Campbell #1; Ex. &ldquo;E&rdquo; Braun #1; AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2122&ndash;2147.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1><UNDER>b) Accidents or malfunctions in the terrestrial environment:</UNDER> Several EAC conditions relate to spill preparedness and response and build incrementally on the NEB's conditions to address concerns raised by the Province and Indigenous groups: Pipeline Design to Reduce Spill Risk (EAC condition 30); Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Units (EAC condition 31); Emergency Response Plans (EAC condition 32); Geographic Response Plans (EAC condition 33); Fate and Behaviour of Bitumen Research (EAC condition 35); Emergency Preparedness and Response Exercise and Training Program and Reporting (EAC condition 36); and Pre-Operations Emergency Response Exercises (EAC condition 37).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;EEEE&rdquo; Campbell #1; Ex. &ldquo;E&rdquo; Braun #1; AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2122&ndash;2147.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1><UNDER>c) Marine outreach:</UNDER> EAC condition 11 requires Trans Mountain to develop and implement an Indigenous marine outreach program in consultation with Indigenous groups that must include the means by which it will communicate with Indigenous groups regarding relevant marine-related initiatives, programs, and research that Trans Mountain is directly or indirectly involved in to address the impacts of increased Project-related tanker traffic in the Salish Sea; and provide opportunities for continued engagement with Indigenous groups to identify potential activities and actions that Trans Mountain may undertake to support safe Indigenous traditional marine use and to support on-going education and planning related to spill preparedness and response.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;EEEE&rdquo; Campbell #1; Ex. &ldquo;E&rdquo; Braun #1; AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2122&ndash;2147.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1><UNDER>d) Access management through the Appellants' asserted traditional territory:</UNDER> EAC condition 22 requires Trans Mountain to prepare an access management plan in consultation with Indigenous groups that must identify measures to avoid or mitigate the disruption caused by construction or operations to the exercise of the rights of access of members of Indigenous groups carrying out traditional use activities<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;EEEE&rdquo; Campbell #1; Ex. &ldquo;E&rdquo; Braun #1; AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2122&ndash;2147.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1><UNDER>e) Protection of burial sites and other land uses for cultural and spiritual purposes:</UNDER> EAC condition 27 requires Trans Mountain to obtain a plan (to be developed in consultation with Indigenous groups) for the mitigation of any Project impacts on archaeological and heritage resources.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ex. &ldquo;EEEE&rdquo; Campbell #1; Ex. &ldquo;E&rdquo; Braun #1; AB, Vol. 6, pp. 2122&ndash;2147.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1><UNDER>f)</UNDER> EAC condition 10 requires Trans Mountain to provide the EAO with Indigenous consultation reports at specified intervals.</P1></P>
<P>45. As set out above, a number of the addition provincial conditions required ongoing consultation with Indigenous groups. The Supreme Court of Canada (&ldquo;SCC&rdquo;) has held that project conditions requiring ongoing consultation may constitute reasonable accommodation. In <EM>Chippewas of the Thames</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Chippewas of the Thames First Nation v. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 41</CITE></CASEREF>, AG BoA, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the SCC considered a challenge to the NEB's approval of a modification to Enbridge Pipelines Inc.'s Line 9 pipeline, which crosses the traditional territory of the Chippewas of the Thames. The NEB imposed a number of conditions on Enbridge to accommodate the interests of the Chippewas of the Thames and to ensure ongoing consultation between the proponent and Indigenous groups. The Chippewas of the Thames argued that any consultation that had occurred was inadequate because it was focused on balancing multiple interests. The SCC found that the appropriate process was &ldquo;...a cooperative one [process] with a view towards reconciliation&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[b]alance and compromise are inherent in that process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chippewas</EM>, at para. 60, AG BoA Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. The Ministers' imposition of conditions in relation to matters within areas of provincial jurisdiction shows that the NEB's scoping errors did not constrain the exercise of the Ministers' statutory power of decision under the <EM>EAA</EM>.</P>
<P>47. The appellants have also raised the issue of whether the Ministers properly appreciated the scope of consultation required. The Court below was of the view that the Ministers did appreciate the context of the consultation and the appellants' opposition to the Project and took the steps that were available to them address those concerns. The Ministers understood that, consistent with the findings of the court in <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, they had &ldquo;[t]otal discretion&rdquo; to impose any conditions ... <EM>within areas of provincial competence</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, at para. 181; see also para. 73; AG BoA Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (emphasis added) The Ministers employed that discretion in issuing the EAC subject to 37 conditions. As a result, there was no scoping error by the Ministers in the provincial process.</P>
<P>48. However, the GiC has accepted the FCA's direction and instructed the NEB to return to an earlier stage of the Project review so as to deal with the maritime transportation failing, as well as to undertake additional consultation with Indigenous groups. This additional Project review may lead to changes to the Project arising from the hearings themselves and from further consultation with Indigenous groups and may lead to the requirement for Trans Mountain to apply for an amendment to the EAC.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>C.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>The Provincial Consultation on the EAC remains adequate despite the FCA decision</UNDER></TI>
<P>49. Canada and the Province were joint participants in the Phase III consultations impugned by the FCA. It is the appellants' submission that the FCA determination that the federal aspect of the joint consultation was insufficient inevitably means the provincial consultation is also inadequate. From that perspective, the mere fact of joint consultation, without more, means consultation was inadequate and the EAC cannot stand. However, the discussion cannot stop there. Rather, the essential issue is whether the deficits identified by the FCA in respect of Canada's consultation are also attributable to the Province, given the Ministers relied on the joint consultation process in making their EAC decision.</P>
<P>50. In contrast to the federal approach, the EAO process for informing the Ministers was more robust and ultimately more responsive to Indigenous concerns through the imposition of additional conditions.</P>
<P>51. Canada was criticized by the FCA for its reluctance to depart from NEB's finding, with the FCA stating that Canada could not rely &ldquo;unwaveringly&rdquo; on the NEB's findings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>FCA Decision at para. 627, AG BoA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Both the provincial EAO and Canada proceeded with consultation on the footing that the Project's impact on the appellants would generally be minor, but that impact assessment relied in large part on the NEB Report, which had concluded that the impact of the Project on Squamish's hunting, trapping and gathering rights was negligible to minor. However, the EAO did go beyond the NEB Report to note that: &ldquo;a spill associated with the Project could result in minor to serious impacts on Squamish's Aboriginal Interests&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>FCA Decision at para. 677, AG BoA, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. In addition, in contrast to the repeated criticism that the FCA made about Canada's consultation process not providing a meaningful two-way dialogue and that Canada's consultation team members were essentially &ldquo;note-takers,&rdquo; the chambers justice found that:
<QUOTE><P>As I read the documentation, the [Provincial] Crown representatives did more than merely record Squamish's concerns for communication to the decision-makers (the Ministers). It is true that they indicated a desire to ensure that they were clearly recording Squamish's concerns. But they also grappled with those concerns and considered them, and in doing so, engaged in a two-way dialogue. This is shown by the exchange of correspondence following the draft section 11 order, and the exchange that followed the meeting of June 23, 2016. It is also demonstrated by the CCAR and its Appendix C.4. That report set out what the Crown had considered, what it understood, and what it concluded. It incorporated Squamish's comments and responses as received.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at para. 155, AR Tab 5, p. 121; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>53. The FCA also consistently criticised Canada for erroneously taking the view that it could not impose additional conditions, which unreasonably limited the scope of federal consultation and accommodation<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>FCA Decision, AG BoA Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. In contrast, the EAO recommended and the Ministers accepted the 37 conditions to the EAC, which the chambers judge described as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The conditions recommended by the EAO after consultation, adopted by the Ministers, included a number addressing the marine environment, oil spill preparedness, access through traditional territory, land uses for cultural and spiritual purposes and requirements for ongoing consultation reports from Trans Mountain (para. 172).</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. Therefore, again in contrast to the FCA critique of Canada's approach, there was evidence of two-way dialogue between the Province and the appellants, showing that the Ministers and EAO were cognizant that they could impose conditions on the Project, as they did.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>D.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>There was no Change in the Province's Position when the Ministers issued the EAC.</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The issuance of the EAC did not constitute a &ldquo;change&rdquo; in the position the Province advanced before the NEB. The Project required both federal and provincial approval to proceed. The GiC's direction to the NEB to grant a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (&ldquo;CPCN&rdquo;) was based on the exercise of exclusively federal powers. The EAC, in contrast, was issued in the exercise of the Ministers' jurisdiction under s. 17 of the <EM>EAA</EM> to adopt measures to, amongst other things, protect the Province's environment. <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM> has made clear that the Ministers cannot refuse to issue an EAC for interprovincial pipelines or otherwise block such projects from proceeding. Consequently, as the Ministers were obliged to do so (if they wished provincial conditions to attach to the Project), the issuance of the EAC cannot be considered a &ldquo;change&rdquo; in the position the Province advanced before the NEB.</P>
<P>56. In addition, as a matter of law, the Ministers, as statutory decision makers, could not be fettered by the position the Province took before the NEB.</P>
<P>57. The appellants also assert that the chambers judge fell into error in failing to determine that the provincial decision makers unreasonably constrained themselves by feeling bound to act only within the constitutional boundaries of their authority. Alternatively, the appellants argue, if the Ministers were obliged to restrain themselves only to actions within their constitutional capacity, they were obliged to consult with the appellants about that constraint.</P>
<P>58. The Ministers acted within the law as set out in <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>, which defined their ability to act as within areas of provincial interest. Consequently, the Court below made no error in finding the Ministers accepted &ldquo;the constitutional reality that the attachment of project conditions was the only possible outcome of the provincial Crown's contemplated conduct&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ at paras. 169 and 171, AR Tab 5, p. 125; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. A duty to consult on the issue of restraint does not arise in a situation where the Ministers are following the direction of the courts.</P>
<P>59. It was in this legal context that the chambers judge made his comments with respect to the question of the adequacy of provincial consultation being &ldquo;largely moot&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, at para. 134, AR Tab 5, p. 115; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> should the appellants be successful before the FCA in their challenge to the adequacy of &ldquo;the NEB process (Phase II of the consultation process)...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFJ, at para. 132, AR Tab 5, p. 115; AG BoA, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He was considering the potential effects of parallel proceedings, given that the EAC had issued for a federal project. In that context, should the FCA, as it did, stop the Project from going forward on its current terms and conditions, the EAC would also be put on hold, until such time as the Project is &ldquo;reset&rdquo; and another CPCN is issued, following additional review and consultation as directed by the FCA.</P>
<P>60. This Court, in <EM>Prophet River</EM>, has stated that judicial review of the decisions of the Ministers in directing an EAC to issue must take place within the context of an understanding of the jurisdictional limits of the decision makers' constitutional authority. In that case, dealing with the challenge of an EAC issued in respect of the Site C project, this Court found:
<QUOTE><P>... there is no sound basis on which to conclude the process of consultation in which the appellants were engaged was other than adequate in the sense of being reasonable in all the circumstances. Reconciliation, as indeed the judge concluded, was not achieved because of an honest disagreement over whether the project should proceed, but that does not mean the process was flawed. The fact that the appellants' position was not accepted does not mean the process of consultation in which they were fully engaged was inadequate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Prophet River</EM>, para. 67, AG BoA Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. The key element is that the Crown must consider all options <EM>reasonably</EM> available to it in considering its response to the issues and concerns raised by the Indigenous group(s) with whom the Crown consults, and after or as a part of such consultation, provide a reasonable response. In our case, the Ministers were not constrained by self-imposed constitutional limitations, but were making their decision within the parameters set out in <EM>Coastal First Nations</EM>. The Court below made no error in finding consultation based on such grounds to be reasonable.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Christopher Gardner, of Unit XXXXXXXXXX AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the President of the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association (the &ldquo;<BOLD>ICBA</BOLD>&rdquo;) and as such have personal knowledge of the facts and matters to which I depose in this affidavit. If any knowledge is stated to be based on my information and belief, I verily believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have been the President of the ICBA since February, 2017. My responsibilities at the ICBA include leading the ICBA's public policy advocacy initiatives related to major construction projects, responsible resource development, and employment and work place regulation; representing the ICBA in meetings with federal, provincial and municipal government officials; and leading the ICBA's senior management team as it builds its training and benefits business.</P>
<P>3. Before joining the ICBA, I was Senior Vice President of Civeo Corporation, one of the largest providers of workforce accommodations (work camps), remote catering services and logistics in North America. The clients of Civeo include large energy and construction companies and their subcontractor companies performing work in remote locations. I was also Executive Vice President of Britco, the largest modular construction company in British Columbia. Britco designs and builds both temporary and permanent workforce accommodations for companies developing and constructing projects throughout Western Canada in the energy and resource development sectors.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background to the ICBA</TI>
<P>4. The ICBA is a voluntary association of construction businesses in British Columbia, representing more than 2,000 companies and clients across the Province, including over 1,000 construction companies.</P>
<P>5. The ICBA was formed in 1975 as an organization to represent and advocate for the interests of open shop contractors, who at that time were routinely denied work on government projects on the basis that its workers were not unionized with the politically powerful Building Trades Unions.</P>
<P>6. The ICBA continues to advocate on behalf of free enterprise and the principle of open and fair bidding for projects, without discrimination on the basis of an employer's association with specific unions.</P>
<P>7. Our position is that economic development brings a range of advantages to British Columbia, including economic prosperity, greater tax revenues to pay for public services, a higher standard of living, and greater employment opportunities for members of the community.</P>
<P>8. The ICBA's mission is to foster and perpetuate the principle of open shop contracting, and to support the success of members through the provision of value added services.</P>
<P>9. To that end, the ICBA engages in various public policy and lobbying activities relating to legislation and government programs involving labour relations, employment standards, apprenticeship training, worker's compensation, safety, and unemployment insurance.</P>
<P>10. It also engages in public advocacy on issues that impact its members, including labour and employment policies, fair tendering, Worksafe BC policies, regulation and taxation, infrastructure, responsible resource development, and generally promoting economic development in the public interest.</P>
<P>11. The ICBA also provides services to its membership, including assistance with arranging various services, including access to health and retirement plans, construction market information, apprenticeship support and management training, and affinity programs that provide discounts on hotels, gas, and other goods and services.</P>
<P>12. The ICBA is also the single largest sponsor of construction apprentices in BC and trains over 3,000 construction professionals annually.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>ICBA's Interest in the Trans Mountain Expansion Project</TI>
<P>13. Publicly available documents show that, in late 2016, Kinder Morgan Canada obtained regulatory approval from the federal government to proceed with the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;), an estimated $7.4 billion expansion of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline system.</P>
<P>14. Subsequently, in January of 2017, the provincial government issued a certificate under provincial legislation approving the Project, which is the approval at issue in this appeal.</P>
<P>15. I understand that the Project includes upgrades to facilities in and around Edmonton; an expansion of the pipeline and associated facilities between Edmonton and Burnaby (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Pipeline</BOLD>&rdquo;); and the construction of three new births at the Westridge Marine Terminal.</P>
<P>16. According to the Trans Mountain project's website, the Pipeline expansion elements of the Project are divided into seven distinct segments across Alberta and British Columbia, with the five British Columbia spreads expected to be contracted to a number of primary contractors.</P>
<P>17. A number of large ICBA construction contractors are expected to bid on contracts to work on various aspects of the Project.</P>
<P>18. It is also common in projects of this magnitude for primary contractors to contract with various subcontractors to perform work related to site preparation, clearing, and grading; transportation of materials to site; on-site staging of equipment; workforce accommodation and catering; power generation; design and engineering services&mdash;civil, structural and environmental; site security; and equipment rental.</P>
<P>19. Therefore, many ICBA member organizations have been or will be seeking contracts or subcontracts to work on the Project, given the enormous size of the Project and the prevalence of ICBA members as key construction industry participants in every region of the province.</P>
<P>20. According to recent Conference Board of Canada reports, the Project is expected to be massive in scale, and to have significant economic benefits to British Columbia and its workforce.</P>
<P>21. With respect to the initial construction of the pipeline and related infrastructure, and based on a projected capital cost of $5.4 billion, the Conference Board estimated in 2014 that the Project will create 58,037 person-years of employment. It also estimated that the Project will employ approximately 13,500 employees at the peak of the construction phase, and that it is expected to generate a total of $1.2 billion in federal ($646 million) and provincial ($568 million) government revenues, with the majority of those benefits accruing in British Columbia. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of that June 2014 Conference Board Report.</P>
<P>22. More recently, the Conference Board further estimates that the overall economic benefits of the Project will be much greater; 802,000 person-years of employment and $46.7 billion in government revenues over a twenty-five year period (between 2012 and 2038), much of which will accrue directly to businesses, employees, and governments in British Columbia. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of that December 2015 Conference Board Report.</P>
<P>23. Therefore, the Project is expected to make up a sizable share of economic and employment opportunities in the Province for construction firms and employees, and will continue to provide economic benefits and opportunities into the future for ICBA members.</P>
<P>24. Large scale construction projects, such as those involved in the Project, are the lifeblood of the ICBA membership. ICBA members and their skilled workers are involved in virtually all major capital and infrastructure projects built in British Columbia.</P>
<P>25. To use a few examples: the approximately $3 billion Port Mann Bridge project was managed by an ICBA member, Peter Kiewit Sons, and Flatiron Constructors Canada. That project engaged over 100 sub-contractors, many of which were also ICBA members. Similarly, the approximately $2 billion Canada Line SkyTrain construction project involved over 400 supply and construction contracts, many of which were given to ICBA members.</P>
<P>26. Like these other large scale construction projects in the province, the ICBA expects that, over the life of the Project, a large number of contractors will obtain contracts or subcontracts on the Project, many of them members of the ICBA.</P>
<P>27. Given the unprecedented opportunities presented by the Project, the suspension, obstruction or cancellation of the project will have a direct and significant economic impact on many of the ICBA's members.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Proposed Intervention</TI>
<P>28. The ICBA represents a broad range of contractors within the construction industry of British Columbia and is an influential voice for legal and public policy advocacy and reform in the Province.</P>
<P>29. For the reasons set out above, many of the ICBA's members will be directly impacted by the appeal.</P>
<P>30. The ICBA has also participated as a party or intervenor in all levels of court and before various tribunals in a range of cases raising public law issues, including cases relating to privacy and freedom of information, labour relations and employment standards, challenges to tendering policies, freedom of expression and association in the workplace, and elections financing. See, for example: <CASEREF><SOC>Independent Contractors and Business Assn. of British Columbia v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>[1995] B.C.J. No. 777</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Vertex Construction Services v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 115</SOC><DOCKET>BCLRB No, B122/2000</DOCKET></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Advance Cutting &amp; Coring Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 70</CITE></CASEREF> (as a member of the Canadian Coalition of Open Shop Contracting Associations); <CASEREF><SOC>Daryl-Evans v. Empl. Standards</SOC><CITE>2002 BCSC 48</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Ledcor Industries Limited</SOC><CITE>2003 CIRB 216</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 213 v. Hochstein</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 355</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Allan v. British Columbia (Chief Electoral Officer)</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1174</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Vander Zalm v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1320</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Financial Institutions Commission (Re)</SOC><CITE>2013 BCIPC 2</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Construction and Specialized Workers Union, Local 1611 v. British Columbia (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 1471</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Office of the Superintendent of Pensions (Re)</SOC><CITE>2017 BCIPC 17</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>31. The ICBA is therefore in an ideal position to represent the community of contractors who would be significantly impacted by the outcome of this appeal, both in terms of the membership's ability to participate in the Project at issue, and in terms of any decision that could result in a less efficient and streamlined consultation process with respect to large-scale projects that impact the rights of First Nations.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Coalition Intervenors</TI>
<P>32. In the court below, the ICBA intervened jointly with the Progressive Contractors Association of Canada (&ldquo;<BOLD>PCA</BOLD>), the Canadian Iron, Steel and Industrial Workers' Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CISIWU</BOLD>&rdquo;), and the Canada West Construction Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CWCU</BOLD>&rdquo;) (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Coalition Intervenors</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>33. I have consulted with the other members of the Coalition Intervenors. Specifically, I have consulted with Paul de Jong of PCA, Francis W. Nolan of CISIWU, and Ken Baerg of CWCU.</P>
<P>34. The other members of the Coalition Intervenors also seek to intervene in the appeal of this matter and have authorized me to include their affidavits from the BC Supreme Court (Case No. S-173649) as exhibits to my affidavit, for the purpose of this application to intervene in the appeal.</P>
<P>35. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Affidavit #1 of Paul de Jong, sworn on August 14, 2017.</P>
<P>36. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Affidavit <BOLD>#1</BOLD> of Francis W. Nolan, made on July 25, 2017.</P>
<P>37. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Affidavit #1 of Ken Baerg, made on August 9, 2017.</P>
<P>38. The Coalition Interveners have a common interest in ensuring that the Project (and others like it) proceed without delay or obstruction, and that any decision on appeal takes into account the importance of maintaining clear lines of jurisdictional authority with respect to government approval of large-scale construction and resource extraction projects.</P>
<P>39. If granted leave to intervene, the Coalition Intervenors will seek to avoid the duplication of submissions of the parties, and will limit their submissions and participation to that permitted by the Court.</P>
<P>40. I have read and confirm that the proposed legal submissions set out in the Coalition Intervenors' Memorandum of Argument on this application accurately reflect the position of the Coalition Intervenors in this appeal, and represent the position to be advanced by the Coalition Intervenors' counsel, subject to any necessary changes resulting from the arguments advanced by the parties or directions of the Court.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Late Filing of the Coalition Intervenor's Notice of Motion and Memorandum of Argument</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. The Coalition Intervenors were unable to file their application materials within the 14&mdash;day deadline, because of the timing of their receipt of the filed factum from the Appellants/Petitioners.</P>
<P>42. I am informed by counsel, and do verily believe, that our counsel received the filed factums of the Appellants/Petitioners and the Respondents in the appeal on December 27, 2018, from the Respondent Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC, and this was the first time our counsel was made aware that all of the parties factums had been filed on these dates.</P>
<P>43. The Appellants' factum had been filed on December 20, 2018, and both Respondents' factums had been filed on December 21, 2018. Under the Rules, the 14-day deadline for intervenor applications expired on January 3, 2019.</P>
<P>44. Due to the delay in receiving the filed materials, and holiday travel and vacations of the various representatives of the Coalition Intervenors and our legal counsel, we were unable to prepare the Coalition Intervenor's materials by January 3, 2019, which was the deadline under the Rules and have just been able to complete these materials now.</P>
<P>45. I am informed by our legal counsel that counsel for the Government Respondent h as consented to the late filing of our intervenor application.</P>
<P>46. I am also informed by our legal counsel that they contacted counsel for the Appellants/Petitioners and counsel for the Respondent Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC on January 21, 2019, to determine whether the parties would consent to the late filing of our intervenor application.</P>
<P>47. I am informed by our legal counsel that the Appellants/Petitioners' counsel advised that they were seeking instructions on the matter. At the of swearing this affi davit, we have not yet heard back from counsel for the Appellants/Petitioners.</P>
<P>48. I am also informed by our legal counsel that they have not heard back from counsel for the Respondent Trans Mountain on the matter.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">A. Request of an Extension of Time to File Application for Leave to Intervene</TI>
<P>1. At the outset, the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association (&ldquo;<BOLD>ICBA</BOLD>&rdquo;), the Progressive Contractors Association of Canada (&ldquo;<BOLD>PCA</BOLD>&rdquo;), the Canadian Iron, Steel and Industrial Workers' Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CISIWU</BOLD>&rdquo;), and the Canada West Construction Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CWCU</BOLD>&rdquo;) (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Coalition Intervenors</BOLD>&rdquo;) seek an extension pursuant to Rule 52 of the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM>, B.C. Reg. 297/2001 to file their notice of motion and memorandum of argument.</P>
<P>2. The Coalition Intervenors were unable to file their application materials within the 14&mdash;day deadline, because of the timing of their receipt of the filed factum from the Petitioners/Appellants, and the holiday travel and vacations of the various representatives of the Coalition Intervenors, as well as their legal counsel.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Christopher Gardner, made on January 21, 2019 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Gardner Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1></P>
<P>3. Both the Government Respondent and Trans Mountain Respondent consent to the late&mdash;filing of the Coalition Intervenors' application for leave to intervene. The Petitioners/Appellants advise that they do not consent to the late filing of the Coalition Intervenors' application, nor will they actively oppose it.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">B. Overview of the Proposed Intervenors and its Interest in the Appeal</TI>
<P>4. The Coalition Intervenors seek leave to jointly intervene in this appeal, to file a factum, and to have the question of oral argument determined by the panel subsequently appointed to hear the appeal.</P>
<P>5. The ICBA was established in B.C. over forty years ago and is the oldest open shop organization in Canada. Representing more than 2,000 companies and clients, including over 1,000 construction companies, ICBA members and their skilled workers are involved in virtually all major capital and infrastructure projects built in British Columbia.</P>
<P>6. The ICBA advocates on behalf of free enterprise and the principle of open and fair bidding for projects, without discrimination on the basis of an employer's association with specific unions. ICBA is also the single largest sponsor of construction apprentices in BC and trains over 3,000 construction professionals annually.
<P1>Gardner Affidavit.</P1></P>
<P>7. The PCA represents approximately 115 construction companies with unionized workforces across Canada, including many in British Columbia.</P>
<P>8. It advocates in favour of sustainable economic development initiatives and reasonable regulatory reforms, and seeks to promote productive and collaborative labour-management relationships that serve both worker and employer interests.</P>
<P>9. To achieve these goals, it engages in public and industry-level advocacy on behalf of its members, and provides a range of advisory and educational services to its member companies.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Paul de Jong, made on August 14, 2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>de Jong Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1></P>
<P>10. The two other organizations making up the Coalition Intervenors are trade unions: the Canadian Iron, Steel and Industrial Workers' Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CISIWU</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Canada West Construction Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>CWCU</BOLD>&rdquo;), both of whom have collective bargaining relationships with construction companies that have an interest in participating in the Project.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Ken Baerg, made August 9, 2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Baerg Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), at paras 7&ndash;12;</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Francis W. Nolan, made July 25, 2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Nolan Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), at paras 5, 8.</P1></P>
<P>11. The CISIWU and the CWCU represent thousands of members who work in the construction industry across British Columbia.
<P1>Baerg Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 3&ndash;5, 7-8;</P1>
<P1>Nolan Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM> at para 8.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Direct Interest</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. The Coalition Intervenors have a direct interest in the appeal in terms of their interest in supporting and obtaining work on the Project itself.</P>
<P>13. If the relief sought in the appeal is granted, that would cause further and more extensive delays in moving the Project ahead, if not halting it altogether, which would cause direct harm to all of the members of the Coalition Intervenors.</P>
<P>14. Large scale construction ventures like the Project are of significant importance to the economic strength and prosperity of ICBA and PCA members in the construction industry.
<P1>Gardner Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM>;</P1>
<P1>de Jong Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>15. Therefore, the Project&mdash;estimated at approximately $7.4 billion dollars&mdash;represents an important economic opportunity for the companies represented by the ICBA and the PCA.
<P1>Gardner Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM>;</P1>
<P1>de Jong Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>16. The Project will also provide a large number of jobs for construction workers represented by the other Coalition Intervenors&mdash;CISIWU and CWCU.
<P1>Baerg Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 7&ndash;12;</P1>
<P1>Nolan Affidavit, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 7&ndash;13.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Public Interest</UNDER></TI>
<P>17. Equally important from the perspective of the Coalition Intervenors is the broader public law principles at stake in this proceeding, and its potential impact on the ability of governments to support construction and resource extraction projects without undue delay.</P>
<P>18. The Petitioners/Appellants allege that in approving the Project, the provincial Crown failed to fulfil its duty to consult the Petitioners/Appellants.</P>
<P>19. In the Federal Court of Appeal, the Petitioners/Appellants&mdash;along with many other First Nations and other stakeholders who may be impacted by the Project&mdash;made essentially an identical claim against the federal government with respect to the federal approval of the same project. The Federal Court of Appeal rules that additional consultation by the Federal Govern ment with First Nations groups was required in order to fulfill the duty to consult. That additional federal consultation is underway.</P>
<P>20. In granting the certificate, the provincial government relied heavily on the consultation processes and procedures undertaken by the federal government, given the federal government's primary responsibility over the regulation and approval of interprovincial pipelines.</P>
<P>21. The provincial government cannot lawfully obstruct the Project, given the federal government's primary constitutional responsibility over interprovincial pipelines. As a result, the provincial government must follow the federal lead on this matter.

<P>22. From the Coalition Intervenors' perspective, it is important that the jurisdictional lines with respect to the approval of such projects be maintained, in order to promote consultations with the appropriate government authority and to avoid the risk of undue delay and inefficiency in the approval process.</P>
<P>23. While fully supporting the importance of the Crown fulfilling its constitutional obligations to the Petitioners/Appellants, it is also important that the protection of aboriginal rights does not result in a means by which large scale projects can be effecti vely paralyzed by overlapping consultation processes and court challenges.</P>
<P>24. Maintaining clear jurisdictional lines, and therefore clear lines of responsibility in terms of the duty to consult, is particularly important in large scale, cross-jurisdictional projects which may impact many First Nations groups.</P>
<P>25. If both levels of government owe a duty to consult with every group impacted with respect to the approval of a single project, the duplicative consultation processes and subsequent court challenges in multiple jurisdictions could represent an undue obstruction to project approvals with no benefit in terms of the quality or meaningfulness of the consultation.</P>
<P>26. The risk of overlapping duties to consult across multiple jurisdictions&mdash;and subsequently overlapping and potentially conflicting court proceedings and remedies&mdash;is of serious concern to the Coalition Intervenors and others who depend on resource extraction and project construction for jobs and economic prosperity.</P>
<P>27. This appeal therefore raises important public law issues of significance to the Coalition Intervenors, and the public at large, which may result in the blurring of the division of powers with respect to ultimate responsibility over the approval of interprovincial pipeline projects and obligations to First Nations communities.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">C. Legal Test to be Applied</TI>
<P>28. An order granting leave to intervene in an appeal is discr etionary, and may be made on any terms and conditions the Court considers appropriate. This Court may grant leave to intervene in circumstances where:
<P1>i. A party has a direct interest in an appeal; or</P1>
<P1>ii. The appeal raises public law issues that legitimately engage the applicant's interests, and the applicant brings a different and useful perspective to those issues that will be of assistance to the Court.</P1>

<P>29. The Coalition Intervenors have a direct interest in the outcome of this appeal and can make a valuable contribution to the important public law issues raised in this appeal in light of their unique perspective.</P>
<P>30. As set out above, the Coalition Intervenors have a direct interest in the ability of their members to have an opportunity to obtain work on the Project that the appeal is attempting to hal t or delay.</P>
<P>31. If the Petitioners/Appellants are successful, the Court's decision will likely have a direct and prejudicial effect on the economic interests of the members of the Coalition Intervenors, all of whom will lose the opportunity to obtain economic benefits arising out of participation in the $7.4 billion project.

<P>32. The Coalition Intervenors have a further legitimate and direct interest in the public law issues raised by the Petitioners/Appellants' claim, particularly in terms of e nsuring clear jurisdictional lines for the approval of large scale resource extraction and construction projects.</P>
<P>33. It is critically important to the Coalition Intervenors&mdash;unions, businesses, and associations alike&mdash;that environmental approval and consultation processes with First Nations be undertaken by the level of government with the final constitutional authority over those approvals and consultations.</P>
<P>34. This would recognize and ensure clear lines of authority with respect to consultation procedures, and avoid encouraging parties to raise substantively similar claims in parallel proceedings in two different jurisdictions with respect to the same project.</P>
<P>35. From the perspective of the Petitioners/Appellants, who assert that they have not been adequately consulted and their constitutional interests not adequately protected, raising claims against both levels of government is understandable, as it would best ensure that the Project does not move forward until adequate consultation has been undertaken.</P>
<P>36. However, from the perspective of maintaining the constitutional division of powers and ensuring the economical use of judicial resources, substantively duplicative proceedings in federal and provincial courts with respect to the approval of a single project risk blurring jurisdictional lines and causing undue and unnecessary delay.</P>
<P>37. Indeed, it is respectfully submitted that in the long run, dueling consultation procedures would promote uncertain lines of authority over the approval of construction and resource extraction projects.</P>
<P>38. This could encourage levels of government to interfere with projects beyond their jurisdiction, or seek to diminish their own responsibility to fulfill the duty to consult regarding those projects over which they have final authority.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">D. Summary of Proposed Submissions</TI>
<P>39. If permitted leave to intervene in the appeal, the Coalition Intervenors propose to make the following submissions, subject to revision based on the arguments of the parties and any orders of this Court:
<P1>iii. Efficiency and timeliness in the approval of large scale resource extraction and construction projects is important to the construction community and others who depend on such projects for economic growth and jobs, such as the Coalition Intervenors;</P1>
<P1>iv. The Coalition Intervenors fully acknowledge and accept the constitutional significance of aboriginal rights and appropriate consultation by the Crown, and recognize that meaningful consultation and accommodation necessarily may delay or, in some circumstances, even prevent certain forms of development;</P1>
<P1>v. However, the Coalition Intervenors intend to submit that the legal principles and requirements in this area should be designed to ensure that consultation takes place as efficiently as possible and with clear lines of jurisdictional authority over the approval of large scale projects;</P1>
<P1>vi. In this context, promoting efficiency and clear jurisdictional lines means that the duty to consult should be concentrated in the body with the primary jurisdiction to approve interprovincial pipelines, i.e., th<EM>e federal</EM> Crown, otherwise it could lead to conflicting government or court decisions with respect to approval;</P1>
<P1>vii. The Petitioners/Appellants are seeking relief against both the pr ovince and the federal government with respect to two different approvals for the same project;</P1>
<P1>viii. The federal government has the ultimate authority over the Project, and therefore even if the province disagrees, the federal government's decision to ap prove or not approve the Project will prevail;</P1>
<P1>ix. It follows that the province necessarily has to rely on the adequacy of the federal government's consultation in terms of whether to approve the Project;</P1>
<P1>x. As a result, the party with the real power to affect the interests of the Petitioners/Appellants is the federal government. The Petitioners/Appellants successfully challenged the adequacy of consultation by the federal government in the Federal Court of Appeal, resulting in additional consultation by the federal government;</P1>
<P1>xi. The federal government is currently undertaking additional consultation, which addresses the deficiencies identified by the Federal Court of Appeal;</P1>
<P1>xii. This appeal challenging the provincial government's decision therefore serves no valid legal purpose, given that the province has no power to halt or obstruct the Project;</P1>
<P1>xiii. And as the Supreme Court of Canada has recently decided, the Crown's duty to consult can be fulfilled by other state actors that have the power to make the &ldquo;final decision&rdquo; over a project, so long as the process &ldquo;affords an appropriate level of consultation to the affected Indigenous group&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo-Services Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 40</CITE><PARANUM>29&ndash;31, 39</PARANUM></CASEREF>;</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Chippewas of the Thames First Nation v. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 41</CITE><PARANUM>31-32, 37, 44</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>xiv. In this case, federal consultation conducted primarily through the NEB was the appropriate mechanism to fulfil the Crown's duty to consult, given the federal government's power to make the &ldquo;final decision&rdquo; with respect to the Project;</P1>
<P1>xv. To the extent that Coastal First Nationals could be interpreted by requiring that the federal and provincial governments are required to maintain separate and independent consultation processes, this interpretation would be an error which could have adverse consequences which are neither required by nor consistent with constitutional principles;</P1>
<P1>xvi. In summary, the Coalition Intervenors will respectfully submit that the court should deny this appeal on the basis that:
<P2>a. the Petitioners/Appellants' real, substantive constitutional interests have been adjudicated in the federal jurisdiction because of the federal government's exclusive power over the ultimate approval of the Project;</P2>
<P2>b. the Petitioners/Appellants' position and constitutional interests have been adequately protected in the Federal Court of Appeal proceedings in adjudicating the sufficiency of federal consultation; and</P2>
<P2>c. duplicative consultations and overlapping proceedings unnecessarily increase costs and delay, and risk conflicting decisions on approval by two different orders of government as well as conflicting court decisions, even though only one level of government has the authority to make a &ldquo;final decision&rdquo; with respect to the Project.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">E. The Submissions of the Proposed Intervenors will be Useful and Different from those of the Other Parties</TI>
<P>40. In advancing the above positions, the Coalition Intervenors will be providing a useful and unique perspective not otherwise represented in this appeal&mdash;namely, that of key businesses and a broad segment of the workforce who expect to obtain work on the Project&mdash;and will advance arguments that will be of assistance to the Court in terms of understanding the broader impact of t he relief sought by the Petitioners/Appellants, and the legal basis advanced in support of that relief.</P>
<P>41. More specifically, the Coalition Intervenors are in an ideal position to make submissions on the importance of ensuring clear jurisdictional lines with respect to the approval of large-scale resource extraction and construction projects, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of the claimants will be adequately safeguarded in the parallel proceedings.</P>
<P>42. The participation of the Coalition Intervenors will not expand the scope of the proceedings or prejudice any of the parties, and efforts will be made to ensure that the submissions of the Coalition Intervenors will not duplicate those submissions made by t he parties to this appeal.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">F. Orders Sought</TI>
<P>43. For the reasons set out above, the Coalition Intervenors respectfully request:
<P1>a. That it be granted leave to intervene in this appeal;</P1>
<P1>b. That it be permitted to file a factum of no more than 20 pages on or before a date to be specified by the Court;</P1>
<P1>c. That it be granted permission to apply to the panel hearing the appeal for leave to prevent oral argument; and</P1>
<P1>d. That there shall be costs of this application or costs of the appeal awarded for or against the Coalition Intervenors.</P1></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The appellants, Squamish Nation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Squamish</BOLD>&rdquo;) make the following submissions with respect to the Independent Contractors and Business Association, the Progressive Contactors Association of Canada, the Canadian Iron, Steel and Industrial Workers' Union, and the Canada West Construction Union (collectively the &ldquo;<BOLD>intervenors</BOLD>&rdquo;) application to intervene, and extension of the filing period for the application:</P>
<P>2. The appellants:
<P1>a) take no position on the application seeking an extension to file the application for leave to intervene, subject to there being no delay in the hearing of the appeal; and</P1>
<P1>b) oppose the application of the intervenors seeking leave to intervene.</P1></P>
<P>3. The appellants oppose the intervenors' application to intervene on the grounds that they do not meet the grounds for intervention. The intervenors:
<P1>a) do not have a direct interest in the appeal; and</P1>
<P1>b) do not meet the requirements of a public interest intervenor because they will not bring a different and useful perspective to the issues on appeal that will be of assistance to the court.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>THE SQUAMISH APPEAL</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. Squamish is appealing an order of the British Columbia Supreme Court that found that the Province had adequately consulted the appellants prior to issuing an Environmental Assessment Certificate (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Certificate</BOLD>&rdquo;) for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). This matter has been set down for hearing on April 10, 2019 for 1.5 days.</P>
<P>5. The appellants have submitted on the appeal that the Court below erred in determining:
<P1>a) that the Province was able to rely on the National Energy Board (the &ldquo;<BOLD>NEB</BOLD>&rdquo;) report as an equivalent assessment report for the Project;</P1>
<P1>b) that the adequate consultation did not and, constitutionally, could not require the Province to fill information gaps (or consult about filling perceived gaps) in the NEB assessment before deciding whether to issue a provincial Certificate;</P1>
<P1>c) that the Province did not have an obligation to consult with Squamish on the Province's change in position from the NEB process on the adequacy of the information on Project-related spills; and</P1>
<P1>d) that the Province was constitutionally constrained with respect to its obligations to consult and accommodate Squamish and by failing to find that the Province had an obligation to explain those constraints to Squamish.</P1></P>
<P>6. The appellants also submit in their appeal factum that, the NEB report having been set-aside as flawed by the Federal Court of Appeal in <UNDER><CASEREF><SOC>Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 FCA 153</CITE></CASEREF></UNDER>, there is no longer a legal foundation for the provincial Certificate that purported to rely on the NEB report,</P></BLOCK2>

An order granting intervenor status is discretionary and can be granted where the intervenor has (1) a direct interest in the litigation, in the sense that the result of the appeal will directly affect its legal rights or impose on it some additional legal obligation with a direct prejudicial effect or where (2) the appeal raises public interest issues that legitimately engage the applicant's interests, and the applicant brings a different and useful perspective to those issues that will be of assistance in resolving them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Carter v.
