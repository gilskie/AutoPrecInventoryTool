<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICATION</TI>
<P>This is an application for judicial review in respect of the Canada Revenue Agency's proposal letter dated September 21, 2012 for the reassessment of Ron Chekosky's 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax. The proposal letter reassessed the self-employed income in 2005 from -$15,390 to $29,410, from $10,803 to $91,977 in 2006 and from -$11,381 to $86,546 in 2007.</P>
<P><BOLD>The applicant makes application for:</BOLD>
<P1>1. The quashing of the proposal letter dated September 21, 2012 of Dwayne Sweetland.</P1>
<P1>2. Reimbursement of $22,707 plus 5% interest from a garnishment on May 2, 2011 based on an original assessment.</P1>
<P1>3. Reimbursement plus 5% interest for all garnishments taken because of arrears interest, late filing penalties and negligence penalties that were a result of the reassessment in the proposal letter dated September 21, 2012.</P1>
<P1>4. Such further and other relief as this Honorable Court deems just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>The grounds for the application are:</BOLD>
<P1>1. I never received the proposal letter dated September 21, 2012 stating that I have 30 days to refute the audit and reassessment of my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax filings by the CRA, thus I was not able to provide the documentation to support my initial filings and refute the proposal letter within the time limit required. I did not have the opportunity to appeal the ruling and decision of the audit nor did I know a deadline for appeal even existed.</P1>
<P1>2. I was constantly misinformed, misled and my rights as a taxpayer were not followed. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights states the &ldquo;CRA will serve taxpayers with a high degree of accuracy, professionalism, courtesy, and fairness.&rdquo; This aligns with a study released by the Auditor General, Michael Ferguson, in 2017 stating that only 36% of calls to the tax agency are able to connect and that taxpayers are given wrong answers to their questions almost 30% of the time.</P1>
<P1>3. I was told by CRA to refile my initial returns in 2014 with the understanding that they would be reopened and I could provide any required backup documentation. A letter received from CRA stated they would not be re-assessing my filings because no new documentation was provided. I was misled to believe that by refiling my income tax from 2005, 2006 and 2007 J would then have an opportunity to meet with the CRA and provide whatever documentation they require. If I would have been told that I needed to provide the documentation with my re-filing, I would of done so.</P1>
<P1>4. I was instructed to then initiate a second independent review of the decision by writing to the Director of the Winnipeg Tax Services Office. In the understanding that as a part of the this second review that I might be able to meet with the CRA to provide any of the required documentation, I submitted the request and it was acknowledged as received by the CRA. My case was denied and I was not granted a chance to provide the documentation.</P1>
<P1>5. I was then instructed to file for a second impartial review as per instruction from the CRA which was also denied.</P1>
<P1>6. In March of 2017, I received a copy of a Memo for File that contained the CRA transcripts with regards to the audit conducted on my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax filings. The Memo for File contains information beginning on May 11, 2011 and finishes on December 5, 2012. Within the memo, there are some important statements made by the CRA that show that the audit process used not actually a full audit as the CRA stated in the Memo for File:
<P2>a. On March 7, 2012 as per the Memo to File, Auditor Sweetland states &ldquo;Attempted to reconcile credit card and cheque payments .....and it could not be done in a timely manner.&rdquo; This does not seem like a correct or fair procedure to follow when conducting what has been stated as being a full audit.</P2>
<P2>b. On August 23, 2012 as per the Memo to File, Auditor Sweetland states that he spoke with his team leader, Ed Gorber and &ldquo;He said the proposal letter should have already been prepared based on industry average and I should do so immediately. He then stated that we should just propose on income as it might be too time consuming to go through all the records to verify expenses.&rdquo; This does not seem like a correct or fair procedure to follow when conducting what has been stated as being a full audit.</P2></P1>
<P1>7. In March of 2017, I also received for the first time, the proposal letter dated September 21, 2012 along with a copy of the working papers showing how the audit was conducted. As per the Memo for File containing the transcripts, they show that Sweetland and Gorber had various conversations about how Sweetland thinks that industry expense averages and industry income averages should be applied to the audit. I had no idea that the audit was going to be completed using industry averages for both income and expenses. Sweetland and Gorber also thought there were some unidentified deposits in my accounts which they used as income. I did not realize they thought there were unidentified deposits until I received the working papers of the audit. Once I reviewed these working papers of the audit, it was easy for me to determine these unidentified deposits were actually transfers between bank accounts. To this day, I have still not had the opportunity to explain this to the CRA.</P1>
<P1>8. In order for my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income to be accurate and fair as per the requirements of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, bank statements, deposit slips and cancelled cheques should have been used as part of a full audit to correctly calculate the income. This was not done.</P1>
<P1>9. By using industry averages for my expenses for the audit of my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax reassessments, my expenses were calculated as much lower than what was actually spent and what would be shown if a full audit would have been undertaken using receipts, cancelled cheques and credit card statements. As part of the full audit, the CRA should of asked me to show them the expenses if they thought it would be too time consuming to do it themselves and not just of used industry averages.</P1>
<P1>10. If the proposal letter dated September 21, 2012 is not quashed, I will have a lifetime sentence of financial debt as there is no way I can pay back the principle owing. The garnishments will continue until I die as the garnishments are only barely covering the interest on the balance owing.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>This application will be supported by the following material:</BOLD>
<P1>1. Affidavit of Ron Chekosky; and</P1>
<P1>2. Such further and other materials as the applicant may advise and this Honorable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P>The applicant requests the CRA to send a certified copy of the following material that is not in the possession of the applicant but is in the possession of the CRA to the applicant and to the Registry:
<P1>1. Any CRA transcripts or Memo for File pertaining to the discussions of my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax years.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF RON CHEKOSKY</TI>
<P>I, Ron Chekosky, of the City/Town of Winnipeg in the Province of Manitoba MAKE OATH AND SWEAR (or AFFIRM):
<P1>1. My 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax assessments were sent to me in 2008 by the CRA. The CRA assessments were for taxes owing in the amount of $6912.30 for 2005, $7144.39 for 2006 and $5841.98 for 2007. Refer to the Detailed Statement of Account, Page 8, in Exhibit A showing the CRA Assessments dated December 08, 2008.</P1>
<P1>2. The taxes owing, penalties and interest based on the assessments were levied. For the outstanding balances owing due to the assessments, late filing penalties and arrears interest, a garnishment was made on May 2, 2011. Refer to the Detailed Statement of Account, Page 9, in Exhibit A showing the garnishment on May 02, 2011 for $22,707.02, which zeros my account balance.</P1>
<P1>3. Returns for 2005, 2006 and 2007 were filed in 2010 by Don Mitchell to meet deadlines set by CRA. The filed returns stated income of -$16990.00 for 2005, $10803.00 for 2006 and -$11381.00 for 2007. Refer to Exhibit B for the filed income tax returns.</P1>
<P1>4. In June 2011, my wife was diagnosed with cancer and our priorities shifted into looking into any sort of options with how to move forward with treatment and the CRA issues were not looked at for a few months.</P1>
<P1>5. A scheduled meeting, that I requested, for an explanation of my T1, payroll and GST accounts was attended with my wife in September 2011. CRA was unprepared and no explanations of any of the accounts were provided to me at this meeting. The CRA employee stated they had just been transferred to this position and was not familiar my request or account. After 3 hours, I was advised that the CRA would be contacting me the next day for further explanation of my accounts. No phone calls were received or made to us. I followed up with 5 phone call attempts with no successful verbal communication.</P1>
<P1>6. In late 2011, a full audit is initiated by CRA for the returns I filed for 2005, 2006 and 2007. On November 10, 2011, CRA auditor, Miyuki requested and met with Don Mitchell and I at the office of Don Mitchell. Miyuki spent 4 hours in the office and asked many generic questions. A question and answer outline from the CRA files is shown in Exhibit P and outlines how myself and Don Mitchell cooperated with the Miyuki for any questions she had. During the meeting, all books and accounting were available to her. Miyuki inquired about Don Mitchell's method of accounting and he provided spreadsheets of the detailed accounting. These spreadsheets for 2006 can be seen in Exhibit Q and for 2007 can be seen in Exhibit R and show that Don Mitchell kept very detailed spreadsheets of all my business transactions.</P1>
<P1>7. On January 11, 2012, I received notice that auditor Dwayne Sweetland was now taking over the file because Miyuki had left on maternity leave. Miyuki had not completed the audit.</P1>
<P1>8. Sweetland continued with the audit and I assumed everything was progressing. During the audit, Sweetland and Don Mitchell were in communication and their opinions on various matters seemed to differ based on the transcripts in the Memo for File shown in Exhibit C. This Memo for File was first made available to me in March, 2017. As noted in the Memo for File, Don Mitchell attempted to explain to CRA auditors what the outfitting industry is, how it works and why I operate a unique business even when compared to other outfitting businesses.</P1>
<P1>9. On March 7, 2012 as per the Memo to File in Exhibit C containing the transcripts that we only received in March 2017, Auditor Sweetland states &ldquo;Attempted to reconcile credit card and cheque payments .....and it could not be done in a timely manner.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>10. On August 23, 2012 as per the Memo to File in Exhibit C containing the transcripts that we only received in March 2017, Auditor Sweetland states that he spoke with his team leader, Ed Gorber and &ldquo;He said the proposal letter should have already been prepared based on industry average and I should do so immediately. He then stated that we should just propose on income as it might be too time consuming to go through all the records to verify expenses.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>11. As per the Memo to File in Exhibit C ,containing the transcripts that we only received in March 2017, they show that Sweetland and Gorber had various conversations about how Sweetland thinks that there is unidentified income and that industry expense average and income averages should be applied to the audit. I had no idea that the audit was going to be using industry averages for both income and expenses. Sweetland and Gorber also thought there were some unidentified deposits in my accounts which they used as income. I did not realize they thought there were unidentified deposits until I received the working papers of the audit in March 2017. Once I reviewed these working papers of the audit, it was easy for me to determine these unidentified deposits were actually transfers between accounts. To this day, I have still not had the opportunity to explain this to the CRA.</P1>
<P1>12. As per the Memo to File in Exhibit C containing the transcripts that we only received in March 2017, a proposal letter was sent to me by registered mail on September 21, 2012. I do not remember receiving this letter or the working papers of the audits for the income tax of years 2005, 2006 and 2007. At a meeting with the Relief Auditor, Joanne Douglas, in March of 2017, she mentions that maybe the proposal letter was not sent by registered mail. The proposal letter and working papers for the audit were given to me by Joanne Douglas and are located in Exhibit D. The proposal letter copy from the CRA file that I was given was not signed so I am not sure if it is even official and binding. I also don't believe that this letter was ever sent to me by registered mail. If you refer to Dec. 5, 2012 in the Memo to File in Exhibit D, it can be seen that the Sweetland says that the&rdquo; taxpayer and rep will be informed of their appeal rights which should give them the necessary time to prepare a defence.&rdquo; I never received anything after Dec. 5 telling me about my appeal rights. Also, why would Sweetland say this on December 5 when he had already supposedly sent me a proposal letter dated Sept. 21 that stated I had 30 days to appeal the after the date of that letter unless that letter was never sent.</P1>
<P1>13. Since I do not remember receiving the proposal letter and working papers for the audits of my 2005, 2006 and 2007, I had no idea how the audit was conducted. The Memo to file in Exhibit C states that myself and Sweetland had a conversation on Sept. 21, 2012 and he explained to me how they had done the audit. I don't clearly recall this conversation but I am sure I would of disagreed with the process they were using which included using industry averages for income and industry averages for expenses. Because I do not remember receiving this letter nor did I ever see it before March 2017, I did not have the opportunity to appeal the ruling and decision of the audit nor did I know a deadline for appeal even existed.</P1>
<P1>14. During November and December of 2012 several attempts were made to contact CRA without success. According to the Memo to File in Exhibit C containing the transcripts that we only received in March 2017, the CRA attempted to call me as well but they did not leave any messages on these attempted calls as per the Memo to File.</P1>
<P1>15. A statement of account was received from the collection agency in 2013 stating that I owe approximately $92,500.</P1>
<P1>16. Through several conversations over the next few months, I was told to refile my 2005,2006 and 2007 taxes so that they can be opened up and re-evaluated. This was completed and the CRA received these in March 2014. My goal was to have the tax filings re-evaluated as I was certain this would alleviate all the owing debts. (It has to be noted that at this point I still have not seen the March 7, 2012 letter and working papers of the audit)</P1>
<P1>17. I received a letter on February 2, 2015, attached in Exhibit E, stating that the CRA had received my 2005, 2006 and 2007 submission and that they had reviewed my submission and determined that they did not receive any new information other than what they had already had. This is true, as stated above, I was told that I should refile my original tax returns(that show that I don't owe what my current CRA balance is showing) and then hopefully I would be able to sit down with a CRA employee to go through my account and I could then be informed what the issues are(which I still think are related to the GST and payroll audits).</P1>
<P1>18. This letter from February 2, 2015 stated &ldquo;The spirit of the taxpayer relief provisions and the purpose for requesting an adjustment under subsection 152(4.2) is not to dispute or disagree on the correctness or validity of a previous assessment. The ability of the CRA to allow an adjustment to amounts for a statute-barred tax year is not used as a means to have issues reconsidered, such as an audit reassessment, where the individual or testamentary trust chose not to challenge the issues through the normal objection/appeals processes or where the issues were already dealt with under the objection/appeal.&rdquo; However, as stated several times in this submission, I do not remember receiving the Sept. 21 2012 proposal letter nor did I see it until March 2017 therefore I never had a chance to appeal or object to it through the normal process. I was led to believe that my resubmission of my 2005, 2006 and 2007 that I was instructed to do would open this appeal process. This February 2, 2015 letter also stated that I can request a second independent review of the decision from the Director of the Winnipeg Tax Services Office. Also in this letter a statement is made stating &ldquo;a full audit was undertaken&rdquo; which is a false statement as a full audit would of utilized the actual business accounting records.</P1>
<P1>19. In February 2015, it was determined that I would need emergency open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement and a double bypass. The surgery took place in March 2015. The recovery process for this major surgery required me to take some time away from the CRA issues to get my health right which delayed the filing for the second independent review.</P1>
<P1>20. The request for the second independent review was submitted on August 7, 2015 as acknowledged by the CRA letter dated September 4, 2015 in Exhibit F.</P1>
<P1>21. A letter from the CRA dated October 7, 2015, refer to Exhibit G, was received and requested further information in regards to my current financial standing and required me to respond before November 9, 2015.</P1>
<P1>22. Answers to the further requested information was sent to CRA in a letter date October 23, 2015 and is attached in Exhibit H.</P1>
<P1>23. A letter dated January 15 2016, refer to Exhibit I, states the CRA's denial of penalties and relief from the second independent review. It states that a second impartial review can be filed. Once again, I am still under the impression that all CRA debt is due to GST and Payroll audits and believe that if my 2005, 2006 and 2007 filings are reviewed, they will provide the required clarification.</P1>
<P1>24. In April of 2016, I submitted for the second impartial review. I never ended up meeting any impartial or independent reviewers. I was able to attend three meetings with CRA employee Joanne Douglas in March of 2017. Joanne informed me that the CRA balances owing were stemming from personal income tax filings for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007and not GST or payroll as I had assumed all along. She supplied me with the proposal letter and working papers dated September 21, 2012 which are attached in Exhibit D.</P1>
<P1>25. With the new knowledge that my 2005, 2006 and 2007 income taxes were audited and calculated by the CRA using industry standards, I can easily see how the CRA debts are incorrect and are not based on my actual business records. Because I now know where my CRA debts are coming from as I now have a copy of the proposal letter and working papers, I feel that all these debts can easily be removed by having the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns reviewed together with the actual financial records, including bank statements, credit card statements and expense receipts.</P1>
<P1>26. With anticipation that Joanne would review these documents based on her statements that she is open to review my accounts and meet to discuss all issues, I took my 2007 documentation to a meeting with her to show her how easily this could be figured out. During the meetings, she used terms like &ldquo;yes, we wear you out&rdquo; and &ldquo;you should just declare bankruptcy&rdquo;. While showing her some examples of expenses, the same documents shown in Exhibit N, she stated &ldquo;these do not mean these expenses were incurred to produce income&rdquo; which left me speechless while trying to realize her mindset to even make a comment on my approach to validate the charter expenses. She did not even want to look at these papers let alone discuss the box of documents I brought with me. Her comments, when I asked about health issues that my wife and myself had, were &ldquo;you have to be on death row for three years before the CRA will recognize health as an issue.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>27. Joanne then called in her supervisor and her supervisor would be reviewing the account. Her supervisor Ron Fines contacted me and said that he now was taking over the account. Once discussions continued with Fines, he said he has referred my case to his boss, Colin Funk.</P1>
<P1>28. Colin Funk advised me to send in a letter to him requesting that my 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 personal income tax, payroll and GST were recalculated using the actual business accounting records and receipts. The letter in Exhibit J and dated April 9, 2017 was sent to Colin Funk.</P1>
<P1>29. Over the next few months, minor communication happens with Colin Funk with regards to my case file but no in person meetings take place that allow me to go through my file with him.</P1>
<P1>30. A letter received in July of 2017, dated June 26, 2017 as seen in Exhibit K, states that no relief is warranted and that we can now apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review.</P1>
<P1>31. Since the next step of the process was to go to federal court, I proceeded to gather my evidence for taking my appeal to court. In reviewing the proposal letter and working papers in Exhibit D, I was able easily determine that many of the unidentified deposits from the proposal letter and working papers were actually transfers between accounts and were counted twice as income by the CRA audit. Proof of the unidentified deposits being transfers is shown in Exhibit L for 2007 and Exhibit M for 2006. Once I removed the account transfers from the unidentified income, the income totals almost exactly match those filed by Don Mitchell on my behalf. I am confident that the income totals claimed by Don Mitchell for 2005, 2006 and 2007 are accurate.</P1>
<P1>32. I then reviewed the proposal letter and working papers in which the CRA used an arbitrary number for expenses for contract work, charters, rentals and repairs and maintenance. Once I reviewed all documentation including receipts, credit card statements, cancelled cheques, bank statements and accounting spreadsheets, I was able to confirm that the total expenses verify what was declared in the filings by Don Mitchell for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Exhibit N shows the charter expenses from 2006, Exhibit O shows the charter expenses from 2007 and Exhibit U shows the rental expenses from 2005 which verify the amounts filed by Don Mitchell for those years. I chose these expenses to verify because in Exhibit D, the CRA used industry averages for the charter and rental expenses and I wanted to show that industry averages for my business are not correct and my expenses claimed in those categories are correct. I am confident the total expenses claimed by Don Mitchell for 2005, 2006 and 2007 are accurate.</P1>
<P1>33. With the debts imposed on me by the CRA for the years of 2005, 2006 and 2007, the CRA has now gone after my wife, Karen Chekosky, because they think that I was sheltering money from the CRA when my business was sold in 2011 and money deposited into my wife's account. This was not the case. In 2011, my account balance with the CRA was zero dollars therefor I did not need to shelter any money from them. Exhibit A shows the statement of account and the zero balance on May 2, 2011. Exhibit S shows the letter from CRA assessing my wife $75,018.86 that ultimately stem from the CRA audits of my 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxes.</P1>
<P1>34. As per Exhibit T, my dealings with the CRA have always been confusion and inconclusive. Exhibit T outlines some of my dealings with the CRA and a letter from Brian Hodgson stating that credits will be applied to my GST account. However, these credits were never ultimately applied, again the CRA claiming Brian Hodgson should never of written that letter.</P1>
<P1>35. Exhibit V shows two letters from the CRA. The letter dated July 6, 2010 in regards to my account states that the CRA wants to set up an appointment for August 25, 2010 for a Trust Exam and required me to bring information and documents in regards to my account. Two days later, I received a second letter, dated July 8, 2010 which is shown Exhibit V, that now says the CRA has &ldquo;registered a certificate in the Federal Court for your arrears of $49,947.94.&rdquo; This is very typical of how the CRA has treated my all along, stating one thing and then doing something else and misleading and misinforming me.</P1>
<P1>36. Exibit Y shows examples of the spreadsheets that I maintained to keep track of business and personal expenses throughout various years.</P1>
<P1>37. On Page 3 of WP #26, the Penalty Recommendation Report, under section (6-d) Taxpayer's Knowledge of Income / Revenue in Exhibit Z, it is stated &ldquo;No deposits of $300 denominations were found. This suggest cash payments were received at conventions etc. and not deposited.&rdquo; If you refer to Exhibit Y, I have shown a copy of my deposit book that shows $300 dollar cheque deposits on March 12, 2007 and also cash deposits from May 9, 2007. I always deposited all my cash into the bank accounts and this is shown in the all bank account summaries.</P1>
<P1>38. On Page 4 of WP #26, the Penalty Recommendation Report, under section (6-i) Proper Information to Agent in Exhibit Z, a statement is made &ldquo;He was only given bank summaries, with additional instructions from Mr. Chekosky on which deposits were not business-related.&rdquo; This clearly contradicts statements made in Exhibit AA on page 2 of WP #41, section I) Records Examined where it is stated that the information available was receipts for expenses claimed, working papers and year-end adjusting entries, business and personal credit card statements and bank statements from all the accounts. This is just another example of the contradictions made throughout the audit process and misinformation that was constantly provided to me.</P1>
<P1>39. On Page 4 of WP #26, the Penalty Recommendation Report, under section (6-i) Proper Information to Agent in Exhibit Z, a statement is made &ldquo;There were no instruction or assistance given to Mr. Mitchell on how to reduce these expenditures to eligible (non-personal) expenses.&rdquo; By referring to Exhibit W it can be seen in the various examples of spreadsheets that the expenses are categorized into business and personal columns. By referring to Exhibit X, it can be seen that a Visa statement has been clearly marked to show what is business and what is personal.</P1>
<P1>40. On page 6 of WP #41, (Note 5) in Exhibit AA a statement is made that &ldquo;Expenses reduced to industry average due to a lack of supporting documentation to substantiate the claims made in response to our arbitrary assessments.&rdquo; This contradicts Page 5 of WP #26, the Penalty Recommendation Report, under section (8) Description of Documentary Evidence and its Location in Exhibit Z where the statements is made that &ldquo;Bank statements, credit card summaries, and unsorted documentation to support expense claims were maintained in cardboard boxes (one for each year, about 20&ndash;30 pounds each)&rdquo;. This is just another example of the contradictions made throughout the audit process and misinformation that was constantly provided to me.</P1>
<P1>41. Exhibit BB, Revenue Projections, shows the projected income for 2005, 2006 and 2007 and concluded that I did not under report my revenue based on the CRA projections and in fact my tax filings way exceeded the calculated projections. With my actual revenue exceeding the projections, it provides merit to me and that I always reported my income correctly.</P1>
<P1>42. I never received the letter dated December 11, 2012 shown in Exhibit CC and thus could not appeal with a Notice of Objection.</P1>
<P1>43. In Exhibit DD under A. General, a statement is made &ldquo;The Provincial Income Allocation Audit (&ldquo;PIAA&rdquo;) should be expanded by the auditor as necessary given the circumstances and potential for adjustment in each case.&rdquo; By stating this, the CRA should of made special exemptions for my expenses as my business operates different than all other outfitting businesses. By using the expense percentages shown in Exhibit D in the working papers, the calculations are very far off from what my incurred expenses are for the various categories.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT OF SANDY DESAUTELS</UNDER></TI>
<P>I, Sandy Desautels, of the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, federal public servant,
<P1>AFFIRM AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P1>
<P1>1. I am employed as a Team Leader, in the Taxpayer Relief Division of the Winnipeg Taxation Centre of the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) and as such have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to by me, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated, I verily believe them to be true.</P1>
<P1>2. The authority of the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) to make decisions pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;) is delegated to me by virtue of the Delegation of Minister's Powers and Duties pursuant to subsection 220(2.01) of the <EM>Act</EM> and by the Ministerial authorization on the delegation of powers, duties and functions under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, dated September 27, 1999.</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Taxpayer Relief Request Process</TI>
<P><P1>3. The decision-making process in the Winnipeg Taxation Centre of the Agency, in respect of cancellation Sof interest or penalties pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, is as follows:
<P2>a) The taxpayer makes an initial request for cancellation of penalties or interest in writing and sends it to the tax centre where they file their return;</P2>
<P2>b) The officer of the Agency assigned to the taxpayer's file reviews the file to ensure that there is sufficient information to make a decision;</P2>
<P2>c) The officer reviews the initial request and makes a decision as to whether to grant the taxpayer's request;</P2>
<P2>d) If the officer accepts the request, he or she will process the reassessment and the decision will be communicated to the taxpayer by letter;</P2>
<P2>e) If the officer denies the request, the decision is communicated in writing to the taxpayer;</P2>
<P2>f) If, after receiving the Agency's decision in response to the initial request, the taxpayer disagrees with the decision, the taxpayer may make a second request in writing to the Agency for a second independent review;</P2>
<P2>g) When a second request is received by the Agency, it is assigned to an officer who was not involved in the decision in response to the initial request;</P2>
<P2>h) The officer reviews the initial request and decision, as well as any new information submitted and compares and comments on its relevance in the context of the Agency's decision in response to the initial request;</P2>
<P2>i) The officer refers the request for a second review to a Team Leader in the Taxpayer Relief Division who was not involved in the decision on the initial request;</P2>
<P2>j) The Team Leader reviews the information provided and the officer's report and makes a decision as to whether to grant the taxpayer's request;</P2>
<P2>k) If the Team Leader accepts the request, the reassessment will be processed and the decision will be communicated to the taxpayer by letter;</P2>
<P2>l) If the Team Leader denies the request, the decision is communicated by letter to the taxpayer.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Guidelines and Factors to be Considered Regarding Interest and Penalties</TI>
<P><P1>4. Attached to this Affidavit and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a copy of Information Circular IC07-1 entitled &ldquo;Taxpayer Relief Provisions,&rdquo; which sets out the factors considered by the Agency in deciding whether to cancel or waive interest and/or penalties.</P1>
<P1>5. In deciding whether to grant a Taxpayer Relief Request, the Agency reviews all of the taxpayer's representations to determine if the assessed interest and/or penalties arose due to circumstances beyond a taxpayer's control or as a result of actions of the Agency. The CRA will also evaluate the taxpayer's ability to pay amounts owing in appropriate circumstances, and will consider whether any other reasons raised by the taxpayer warrant relief.</P1>
<P1>6. In determining whether relief will be granted, the Agency also considers the following factors::
<P2>m) whether or not the taxpayer has a history of compliance with tax obligations;</P2>
<P2>n) whether or not the taxpayer has knowingly allowed a balance to exist on which arrears interest has accrued;</P2>
<P2>o) whether or not the taxpayer has exercised a reasonable amount of care and has not been negligent or careless in conducting their affairs under the self-assessment system; and</P2>
<P2>p) whether or not the taxpayer has acted quickly to remedy any delay or omission.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Process when reviewing Gross Negligence Penalties</TI>
<P><P1>7. When a taxpayer relief request includes a request for relief from gross negligence penalties a joint review is generally conducted by the Taxpayer Relief Division and the Audit Division of the Agency.</P1>
<P1>8. This joint review follows the same general procedures outlined in paragraph 3 of this affidavit. Additionally, a joint review generally requires the Audit Division to conduct a review of all of the years in which relief is being sought from gross negligence penalties. This review is conducted in the same manner as the process followed by the Taxpayer Relief Division.</P1>
<P1>9. One distinguishing feature of a joint review is that the Audit Division prepares a report and recommendation, but does not communicate it directly to the applicant. Rather, this recommendation is sent to the Taxpayer Relief Division Team Leader and if the Taxpayer Relief Division Team Leader agrees with the recommendation, it is communicated to the taxpayer as part of the Taxpayer Relief Team Leader's second review decision letter.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Applicant's Initial Request for Taxpayer Relief</TI>
<P><P1>10. I am informed and do verily believe that on February 2, 2015 the Audit Division of the Agency denied a request for taxpayer relief requesting that the applicant's 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax returns be re-assessed. The initial assessments included gross negligence penalties, and therefore a joint review process involving the Audit and Taxpayer Relief Divisions was followed.</P1>
<P1>11. I am informed and do verily believe that on January 15, 2016, the Appeal Division of the Agency denied a request for taxpayer relief by the applicant with respect to his 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 taxation years (the &ldquo;First Review Decision&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>12. I am informed and do verily believe that the First Review Decision did not consider the applicant's T1 account for the 2008 tax year or the payroll account for the 2006 tax year and 2009 tax year, as no penalties or interest were incurred during those periods on those accounts. The First Review Decision also did not consider the GST account for the period ending on December 31, 2010, as no return was filed for that period.</P1>
<P1>13. The assessments for some of the years in question included gross negligence penalties, and therefore a joint review process involving the Audit and Taxpayer Relief Divisions was followed.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Applicant's Second Request for Taxpayer Relief</TI>
<P><P1>14. I am informed and do verily believe that the applicant made a second-level review request for taxpayer relief with respect to his 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 taxation years, dated April 28, 2016. A true copy of that request and its attachments is attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>15. I am informed and do verily believe that officers of the Agency in the Winnipeg Taxation Centre Taxpayer Relief Division and Audit Division reviewed the applicant's second-level review request and the information contained within the Agency's records. The officers recommended to deny the applicant's request and set these recommendations out in three separate, Second Level Review Taxpayer Relief Fact Sheets, one for the applicant's T1 account (Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;), one for his GST/HST account (Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;) and one for his Payroll account (Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>16. As this was a joint review, the Audit Division of the Agency also prepared a Second Review Taxpayer Relief Decision Report (Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;) outlining its determination. A copy of this report was provided to me in my capacity as Team Leader in the Taxpayer Relief Division.</P1>
<P1>17. In my capacity as Team Leader in the Taxpayer Relief Division in the Winnipeg Taxation Centre, I reviewed the applicant's second-level review request and its attachments (attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;), the Second Level Taxpayer Relief Fact Sheets prepared by Officers of the Agency (Attached as Exhibits &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo; and &ldquo;E&rdquo;) and the Second Review Taxpayer Relief Report prepared by the Audit Division (Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;). My practice is to review:
<P2>a) the applicant's second-level review request and the documents provided by the applicant,</P2>
<P2>b) Fact sheets prepared and considered during the process of the First Review Decision,</P2>
<P2>c) the Second Level Taxpayer Relief Fact Sheets prepared with respect to the applicant's request, and</P2>
<P2>d) in the event of a joint review, the Taxpayer Relief Report prepared by the Audit Division.</P2></P1>
<P1>18. After reviewing the applicant's request and the documents referenced in paragraph 17 of this affidavit, I decided to deny the applicant's request. By letter dated June 26, 2017, I advised the applicant of my decision. A reproduction of this letter is attached to this Affidavit and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>19. I make this affidavit <EM>bona fide</EM>.</P1></P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. Ron Chekosky has commenced this application for Judicial Review as he feels that the Taxpayer Bill of Rights was violated on several occasions by the CRA as the CRA audited and then made an order on Ron Chekosky's 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax filings without gathering the required facts and allowing Ron Chekosky to provide his point of view and supporting documentation.</P1>
<P1>2. By looking at the evidence of this case, Ron feels that the Taxpayer Bill of Rights has been violated as he was not treated professionally, courteously and fairly. He was not provided complete, accurate, clear and timely information. The CRA has not been accountable for their reassessment as Ron has never had the chance to question or provide the appropriate backup documentation to dispute the reassessment.</P1>
<P1>3. The CRA reassessment does not accurately represent the income and expenses of Ron Chekosky for 2005, 2006 and 2007 and the evidence will show this.</P1>
<P1>4. Industry averages cannot be applied to Ron Chekosky's business as the nature of how outfitting businesses operate there can be a wide spectrum of variance from business to business.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P><P1>5. Ron Chekosky never received the CRA proposal letter and working papers dated September 21, 2012 for a CRA reassessment until March of 2017. This meant Ron missed the 30 day deadline for response which has resulted in years of garnishments and appeals.
<P2>Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, para.. 12, Tab 3</P2></P1>
<P1>6. Ron repeatedly tried to meet in person with the CRA to find out why the reassessment put him into such a debt owing to the CRA. Ron never knew what the reassessment and garnishments were stemming from until he received the proposal letter and working papers in March of 2017 after several years of requests and appeals.
<P2>Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, para. 14, 17, 24 and 29, Tab 3</P2></P1>
<P1>7. Once Ron received the proposal letter and working papers from the CRA in March of 2017, he was able to find the errors and assumptions the CRA made in the reassessment. He has not had the chance to question the CRA on any of their calculations or assumptions.
<P2>Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, para. 25, Tab 3</P2></P1>
<P1>8. The CRA changes the wording on July 27, 2016 in the Statement of Account from &ldquo;garnishee payment&rdquo; to &ldquo;payment&rdquo;. They are trying to imply that Ron started to make voluntary payments to the CRA when in fact this is untruthful and deceptive. The last voluntary payment Ron made to the CRA was April 12, 2011 and all other credits shown in the Statement of Account after April 12, 2011 are garnishees.
<P2>Statement of Account, Exhibit A, page 28</P2></P1>
<P1>9. Negligent penalties were applied to Ron Chekosky's account on January 31, 2013, therefore a joint review process involving the Audit and Taxpayer Relief Divisions was followed. This negligent penalty was applied to Ron Chekosky's account based on incorrect calculations and assumptions by the CRA to create the proposal letter and the reassessment. If calculations and assumptions would have been accurate, there would have never been negligent penalties applied to Ron's account and the process involving the Audit and Taxpayer Relief Division would never have been followed.
<P2>Statement of Account, Exhibit A, page 25</P2></P1>
<P1>10. By looking though Ron Chekosky's statement of account, we can see that he always paid all his required payments to the CRA as he has zero balances right up until the audit is conducted and proposal letter created.
<P2>Statement of Account, Exhibit A, page 25</P2></P1>
<P1>11. Ron Chekosky was always very aware of what was correct and accurate when it came to his CRA filings. In November of 2010, Ron filed an amendment for his 2004 return resulting in a $7,024.04 balancing owing which he paid.
<P2>Statement of Account, Exhibit A, page 24</P2></P1>
<P1>12. During the audit process and appeal processes, the CRA had no reviews or checks on Auditor Sweetlands calculations and assumptions which shows no professionalism, fairness or accuracy with Ron's account. If any reviews or checks had be undertaken by any level, the CRA would of certainly found that the extra income in 2006 and 2007, as reported by the CRA, was not in fact income, but transfers between bank accounts. Don Mitchell never counted the transfers as income and Ron Chekosky also located these transfers by looking at the same documentation the CRA had access to. The cancelled transfer cheques were stapled right to the bank statements that Auditor Sweetland reviewed.
<P2>Account transfer summary, Exhibit L, page 92, 94, 98, 105, 109, 116</P2></P1>
<P1>13. Auditor Sweetland put Charter, Subcontractors Expenses to an amount of 23.2% of gross income when in fact the category for charter does not even exist in the CRA Industry Averages for Revenue and Expenses. It is very unprofessional and unfair to lump in an expense into a category that will benefit the CRA just because the category doesn't exist.
<P2>WP # 3000, Exhibit D, page 62 &amp; 70</P2></P1>
<P1>14. Auditor Sweetland states on August 23rd, 2012 that Ed Gorber told him to &ldquo;just propose on income as it might be too time consuming to go through all the records to verify expenses.&rdquo; That statement is very unprofessional and unfair which has led to garnishing of Ron Chekosky's CPP and wages and has caused financial hardship for almost five years which will continue until the day he will die.
<P2>Memo to File, Exhibit C, page 52</P2></P1>
<P1>15. Ron Chekosky has followed the instructions he received from the CRA shortly after the reassessment. He was instructed to refile his exact same returns as he previously filed so that they would be looked at again which led to nothing changing. He was then told to appeal to the Fairness Committee for taxpayer relief and then Interest Relief. These various appeals have taken almost 5 years of which most of the 5 years has been the CRA doing its reviews. It appears that Ron was misinformed of which appeals processes to follow and was never instructed what kind of information to supply with the appeals. Ron was not looking for interest relief he was looking to amend his tax returns and everywhere that he was sent ended up looking at protocols for interest and penalty relief and not actually looking into correcting the issue.
<P2>Letter to Ron Chekosky, Exhibit E, page 71&ndash;73</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART II&mdash;POINTS IN ISSUE</TI>
<P><P1>16. The issue to be determined in this Application is whether the CRA violated the Taxpayer Bill of Rights by not ensuring Ron Chekosky had a copy of the Proposal Letter dated September 12, 2012 which drastically altered his previously filed income tax for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. By the CRA not ensuring he had a copy of Proposal Letter, Ron missed the 30 day appeal deadline without even knowing the deadline was missed and therefore his only option was to pursue legal action to have his income tax filings for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 properly assessed.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>17.</BOLD> The CRA never treated Ron fairly and the CRA has not been held accountable for their calculations and assumptions of the Proposal Letter.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART III&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<P><P1>18. It has been a long process for Ron Chekosky to finally get to Federal Court. During the last 5 years of the appeals and dealings with the CRA, Ron never had the chance to show the CRA the details of his account and he realized that he would need to get to court to finally have someone view his reassessments and see that the CRA incorrectly calculated income and expenses. Ron now fully understands the Auditor General report in 2017 stating that over 30% of inquiries go unanswered and over 30% are given wrong information. Public inquiry counters were closed at CRA centers and there is very limited access for personal inquiries. A recent report also stated that it is the average tax payer who cannot access or afford legal representation that are the ones who feel the biggest burden through the CRA system.</P1>
<P1>19. By reading the CRA transcripts and submissions made by staff of the CRA, after the so called &ldquo;full audit&rdquo;, the CRA tries to conclude that Ron could not be trusted and this information is passed on to everyone handling his file. This is far from the truth. Ron has always led his life with integrity and honesty to the highest standards. Hardwork and honesty had always been instilled in him and he always treated people the way he would want to be treated. Ron has served the public on various boards and committees and has worked for 15 years for Manitoba Agriculture Service Corporation as an agent in charge of staff, office, area administration, budgets, claim adjustments, scrutinizing claims, audits and tribunals. Ron served as VP of Legionl61, VP of Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association, 14 years on the board of directors of MLOA. His integrity was never questioned except for by the CRA.</P1>
<P1>20. The CRA has statements in their transcripts and submissions like &ldquo;he ran away for 9 years&rdquo;. The CRA is trying to imply and put into the file for future reference that Ron was hiding from the CRA for 9 years when in fact the statement &ldquo;he ran away for 9 years&rdquo; was actually by Don Mitchell stating the that Ron changed accountants for 9 years.</P1>
<P1>21. The CRA categorizes Ron with the term &ldquo;gross negligent&rdquo; as the transcripts of Auditor Sweetland state &ldquo;he must of purposely withheld cash deposits and not reported all his revenues&rdquo;. This gets put in Ron's file and one of the first items ready by anyone accessing his file. The facts show that Auditor Sweetland missed transfers from US accounts to Canadian accounts in 2006 and 2007 even after seeing similar transfers in 2005. Auditor Sweetland is the one who has errored. Auditor Sweetland also applied &ldquo;industry averages&rdquo; on expenses because he was instructed to do so as &ldquo;it might be too time consuming to go through all the records to verify expenses.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>22. The CRA reassesses Ron's account with these errors as part of the calculations and supposedly sends a proposal letter to Ron for him to review and object to within 30 days. Ron never receives this letter or the working papers of the audit and thus does not object in the required time frame resulting in the CRA applying the changes to Ron's income tax filings. At anytime from 2012, when the CRA creates the proposal letter, to 2017 when Ron first sees the proposal letter, if Ron would have received a copy of the letter he would have been able to address these errors in calculations sooner than this current court proceeding. All conversations and results from appeals always state that Ron missed his time to appeal the proposal letter and they seem to use that as the main denial of all requests.</P1>
<P1>23. With no second checks or audits on Auditor Sweetland's calculations, reviews and methods used for his audit, it now gets filed as a &ldquo;full audit&rdquo; on my account. All further reviews and interactions carry this tag that a &ldquo;full audit&rdquo; was already conducted on my income tax filings. With Ron working for the Manitoba Agriculture Service Corporation for 15 years, he knows from experience that his and anyone elses audits always have three or four individuals rechecking the calculations used for an audit. If anyone else at the CRA would of reviewed the calculations and methods used, they surely would of noticed that errors by Auditor Sweetland.</P1>
<P1>24. No personnel meetings with the CRA are granted until March of 2017 after years of misdirections given to Ron from the CRA about where to appeal what to submit.</P1>
<P1>25. The CRA had taken action to garnishee all of Ron's CPP and one third of his net income. Ron has not made any voluntary payments to CRA since April 2011 contrary to what the CRA may want to claim. Ron's balance in May 2011 was zero dollars.</P1>
<P1>26. Submissions from Auditor Douglas from a meeting in March of 2017 differ from Ron's, Ron's wife and Ron's son of what was said or done. In Ron's first meeting with Auditor Douglas Ron asked some questions about where his debt was stemming from as he believed it was GST related. She clarified that GST is different and that is not what the debt is from. She said the proposal letter was sent to us and that had all the information in it. I asked for a copy as I did know what proposal letter she was talking about. I asked for proof that this letter was sent by registered mail and that I received it. She then stated that it may have not been sent by registered mail or even sent.</P1>
<P1>27. Ron brought a 20 lbs box of 2007 documentation and she asked where it came from and Ron said from his accountants. Ron proceeded to show Auditor Douglas invoices amounting to thousands of dollars of business expenses and she just said &ldquo;that doesn't mean that those expenses were incurred to derive your business income.&rdquo; Ron did not understand her mindset to make a comment like that when dealing with such an important issue that has put him in a financial burden for the rest of his life.</P1>
<P1>28. Auditor Douglas also made comments in regards to health issues stating &ldquo;CRA interpretation of health issues is that a person would have to be on death row for three years before CRA would consider health an issue.&rdquo; Auditor Douglas commented that the CRA &ldquo;wear you out&rdquo; and stated to Ron &ldquo;that you should just declare bankruptcy.&rdquo; These kinds of bullying tactics lead Ron to believe that the CRA doesn't care, they are not professional and are content to financially burden Ron because of incorrect audits.</P1>
<P1>29. Auditor Douglas had stated in Ron's first meeting that she would be open to meet as many times as Ron needed or would be available for phone calls. After our third meeting, Auditor Douglas called in her supervisor Mr. Fines to take over the case. Mr. Fines then referred the case to Colin Funk. Mr. Funk says to write a letter to him requesting the CRA recalculate my tax returns for the periods in question. No further communication occurs except for a decision letter stating that we can now go to court.</P1>
<P1>30. There are many CRA written statements and submissions that are made in affidavits that are inaccurate or not correct. These include causes of delays, phone calls received, missed phone calls, dates of what was said and how items or statement were interpreted. The cross examinations of these accusations was not exercised because of the cost associated with this course of action.</P1>
<P1>31. Ron and his wife have been consumed by stress and anxiety since the reassessments applied to Ron's account in 2013 and Ron believes it has directly contributed to his health issues.</P1></P></BLOCK2>

<P>1. Applications for judicial review cannot be used to circumvent the comprehensive system of objections and appeals that Parliament has prescribed in tax statutes. This application is an attempt to have this Court vacate reassessments and to order the Minister of National Revenue to reassess the applicant in a particular manner. That relief is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court. As such, judicial review is not available to the applicant.</P>
<P>2. Furthermore, the applicant is seeking judicial review of two decisions, only one of which is reviewable. The applicant received an extension to file an application for judicial review in regards to a taxpayer relief decision, issued on June 21, 2017. His materials on this application seek a remedy instead with respect to a proposal letter dated September 21, 2012. This proposal letter is not a &ldquo;reviewable decision&rdquo; and an application may only be made with respect to a single decision without leave. The applicant was in possession of the proposal letter in 2012. He cannot now seek judicial review of a proposal letter, which is not a reviewable decision and was provided to him more than five years ago.</P>
<P>3. To the extent that this application challenges the Taxpayer Relief decision dated June 21, 2017, the respondent submits that the decision under review was reasonable and based on a thorough review of the relevant facts.</P>
<P>4. This application should be dismissed with costs</P></BLOCK1>

<P>8. An audit of the Returns was conducted between May 11, 2011, and December 5, 2012. Auditors from the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) met with and called the applicant, and asked the applicant to provide additional documents organized in a way that allowed the auditor to verify the applicant's income and expenses for the Taxation Years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 42&ndash;56, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The applicant did not provide any additional documents to the auditor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 53 &amp; 56, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. On September 21, 2012, the auditor sent a proposal letter to the applicant and his representative by registered mail.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record p 54, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The proposal letter set out the basis upon which the applicant would be reassessed if he did not provide additional information within 30 days.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record p 53, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. That same day, the auditor spoke with the applicant by telephone. He informed the applicant that the proposal letter would be mailed as well as the years and tax issues to which it pertained.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record p 53, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. On September 25, 2012, the auditor spoke with the applicant's representative. The representative acknowledged receiving the proposal letter and expressed disagreement with various parts of the proposal letter including the method of assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record p 54, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. On October 16, 2012, the auditor had an additional telephone conversation with the applicant. The applicant disagreed with parts of the proposal letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 54 &amp; 55, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. The auditor granted the applicant a 30-day extension to file the additional information requested. After the extended deadline passed, and not having received any additional documentation from the applicant, the auditor closed the file. The Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) reassessed the Taxation Years in accordance with the contents of the proposal letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 55 &amp; 56, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Taxpayer Relief Requests</EM></TI>
<P>15. In March, 2014&mdash;almost one and a half years after the proposal letter was issued&mdash;the applicant requested that the Taxation Years be reassessed. The Minister denied that request in February, 2015, since the applicant did not provide any new information to support that request. The request was also denied because the applicant did not provide an explanation or documents regarding any extraordinary circumstances preventing him from taking action to straighten out his tax affairs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 71 &amp; 72, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit E)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. In July, 2015, the applicant requested that all interest and penalties from the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 taxation years be waived. In January, 2016, the applicant was advised by letter that no relief would be granted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 82&ndash;84, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit I)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As the assessments for some of the years in question included gross negligence penalties, the Audit and Taxpayer Relief Divisions of the Agency conducted a joint review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record p 7, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautels at para 13)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Taxpayer Relief Decision</EM></TI>
<P>17. The applicant made a final request for review on April 28, 2016 (the &ldquo;Second Level Review&rdquo;). After reviewing that request, officers of both the Appeals and Audit Divisions of the Agency recommended denying the requested relief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record pp 88, 96 &amp; 105, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautel, Exhibit C, D and E)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The decision with respect to the Second Level Review request was issued by Sandy Desautels, Taxpayer Relief Division Team Leader of the Winnipeg Taxation Centre of the Agency, as a delegated representative of the Minister for the purposes of subsection 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act (the &ldquo;Minister's Delegate&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record pp 2 &amp; 3, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautel, at paras 2 &amp; 3)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. To be as thorough as possible, the Minister's Delegate reviewed the applicant's Second Level Review request and the documents provided by the applicant, fact sheets prepared and considered during the first review decision, taxpayer relief fact sheets prepared with respect to the applicant's Second Level Review request and the Taxpayer Relief Report prepared by the Audit Division.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record p 8, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautel, at para 17)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. After reviewing the applicant's request the Minister's Delegate denied the request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record p 9, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautel, at para 18)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The decision was communicated to the applicant by way of a letter dated June 26, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 87&ndash;91, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit K)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The decision invited the applicant to proceed to this Court if he disagreed with the Minister's exercise of discretion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 90, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit K)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART II&mdash;POINT IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>21. The issues in this application are:
<P1>a) whether the relief sought is within this court's jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>b) whether the proposal letter is a reviewable decisions pursuant to section 18.1 of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Federal Courts Act</EM> (RSC, 1985, c F-7), section 18.1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>; and</P1>
<P1>c) in the event this Court finds that this application challenges the taxpayer relief decision dated June 26, 2017, whether the Minister's decision is reasonable.</P1></P>
<P>22. The relief sought is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court and the proposal letter is not a reviewable decision. Furthermore, this application does not challenge the taxpayer relief decision. Nonetheless, the decision is reasonable.</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The relief sought is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Right of appeal and the exclusive jurisdiction of Tax Court</EM></TI>
<P>23. The applicant seeks from this Court an order quashing a proposal letter, which was consistent with subsequently-issued reassessments of the Taxation Years. In essence, he is seeking a declaration that the reassessments are incorrect. The result the applicant wishes to achieve in this application is ultimately to have the reassessments for the Taxation years vacated and replaced with assessments that reflect the applicant's desired outcome.</P>
<P>24. This court does not have jurisdiction to review tax assessments. Judicial review of assessments is not available in this court for decisions which may otherwise be appealed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Federal Courts Act</EM> (RSC, 1985, c F-7), section 18.5; <CASEREF><SOC>Canada v Addison &amp; Leyen Ltd</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 33</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2007] 2 SCR 793</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at para 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, the Tax Court of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals relating to assessments of income tax and to determine the correctness of income tax assessments.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp), subsection 169(1); <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM>, RSC, 1985, c T-2, as amended section 12; <CASEREF><SOC>MNR v Parsons</SOC><CITE>[1984] 2 FC 331</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>61 NR 113 (FCA)</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras 3-4 and <CASEREF><SOC>Roitman v R</SOC><CITE>2006 FCA 266</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>353 NR 75 (FCA)</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras 19-20, leave to appeal denied, SCC No 31634.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Granting the relief sought by the applicant in the instant case would allow the applicant to circumvent the entire objection and appeals process enacted by Parliament. The statutory assessment and appeals process must be preserved.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Merchant Law Group v. Canada (CRA)</SOC><CITE>2010 FCA 184</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>321 DLR (4th) 301 (FCA)</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Unfair assessing practices not grounds for judicial review</EM></TI>
<P>26.

<P>27. The existence of a statutory appeal mechanism precludes the Federal Court from reviewing an assessment notwithstanding any flaws that there might have been in the process. Accordingly this application must be dismissed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Proposal letter is not a reviewable decision</TI>
<P>28. The applicant is seeking to contest the merits of a proposal letter. This letter set out the basis upon which the Minister intended to reassess the applicant's income, absent the applicant providing additional information within a prescribed timeframe.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record p 53, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Minister subsequently issued reassessments consistent with the content of the proposal letter as the applicant failed to provide any additional information.</P>
<P>29. There is no discrete decision within the audit and assessment process that can be separated from the assessment and made the subject of judicial review. Any distinctions that the applicant attempts to draw between the Minister's decision to assess and the act of assessing are not recognized in law and ought to be disregarded.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>J. Ritter v MNR</SOC><CITE>2013 FC 411</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. A proposal letter is not a decision that affects substantive rights, nor is it a final decision to issue a reassessment. Taxpayers substantive rights are not affected until an assessment is made.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Guay v Lafleur</SOC><CITE>1964 SCR 1965</CITE><PAGENUM>p 17</PAGENUM></CASEREF> (para 18)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Consequently, interim administrative actions or decisions are not reviewable decisions within the meaning of s. 18.1 of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Air Canada v Toronto Airport Authority</SOC><CITE>2011 FCA 347</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>426 NR 131</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras 26&ndash;29, 37, 39, 42; <CASEREF><SOC>Democracy Watch v Canada (Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner)</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 15</CITE><PARANUM>9 and 10</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Pieters v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2007 FC 556</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2008] 2 FCR 421</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras 60&ndash;68; <CASEREF><SOC>Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc v Canada (Minister of National Revenue)</SOC><YEAR>1998</YEAR><CITE>148 FTR 3</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1998] FCJ No 79</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at paras 27-28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. Even if the proposal letter was a reviewable decision, the applicant is well beyond any time limits to make an application for judicial review. The proposal letter the applicant is requesting be quashed is dated September 21, 2012. Though the applicant does not remember receiving the letter<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 87&ndash;91, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky para 12)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, the Applicant's Record demonstrates that he was aware of the contents of the letter in 2012 and that he discussed its contents with a CRA auditor after having received the letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 53 &amp; 55, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit C)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The Minister's taxpayer relief decision is reasonable</TI>
<P>32. The applicant does not appear to challenge the Taxpayer Relief decision issued on June 21, 2017. Nonetheless, the Respondent submits that the Taxpayer Relief decision was reasonable and based on a thorough review of the information before the decision maker.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Standard of Review</EM></TI>
<P>33. Taxpayer Relief decisions are discretionary decisions made under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>. The standard of review with respect to decisions under subsection 220(3.1) is that of reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada Revenue Agency v Slau Limited</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 270</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Minister's decision falls within the range of reasonable outcomes</TI>
<P>34. The applicant does not advance any grounds suggesting that the Minister's Taxpayer Relief decision was unreasonable. Rather, his submissions are focused on the audit and assessment process used for the Taxation years. Nonetheless, and out of an abundance of caution, the respondent submits that the Minister's June 21, 2017 Taxpayer Relief decision was reasonable in light of the information before her.</P>
<P>35. Subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> gives the Minister broad discretion to waive or cancel penalties and interest otherwise payable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> para 41</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Agency's administrative guidelines serve to inform the exercise of this discretion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Record pp 10&ndash;33, (Affidavit of Sandy Desautels, Exhibit A)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. The Minister's Delegate considered the applicant's request on its merits, and based on the request and record before her. She applied the appropriate guidelines and concluded that the applicant did not fit any of the situations that warranted granting of relief from penalties or interest.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Record pp 87&ndash;91, (Affidavit of Ron Chekosky, Exhibit K)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. The Minister issued a reasonable decision in light of all the facts presented. That decision should be upheld.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
