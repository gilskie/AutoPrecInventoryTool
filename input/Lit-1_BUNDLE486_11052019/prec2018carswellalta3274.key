<BLOCK2><TI>NOTICE TO DEFENDANTS</TI>
<P><BOLD>You are being sued. You are a defendant.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Go to the end of this document to see what you can do and when you must do it.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Note: State below only facts and not evidence (Rule 13.6)</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Statement of facts relied on:</TI></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), retained the Defendants, Hatch Corporation, Thurber Engineering Ltd., Clifton Associates Ltd., Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to design and construct a 31 kilometre rail spur near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The rail spur was to originate near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, connecting CP's main rail line to a potash mine owned by K+S Potash Canada General Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>K+S</BOLD>&rdquo;), allowing CP to provide rail transportation services for potash mined by K+S.</P>
<P>2. CP retained the Defendant Contractors as engineers and contractors to design and construct CP's portion of the rail spur (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). In the course of designing and constructing the Belle Plaine Project, the Defendant Contractors breached contractual and common law duties they owed to CP, including obligations to perform their respective work reasonably, properly and in conformance with contractual specifications and applicable professional and industry standards.</P>
<P>3. As a result of the failure of the Defendant Contractors to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork construction collapsed. CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks at significant expense.</P>
<P>4. The Defendant, Intact Insurance Company, has refused to honour and fulfil its obligations under a performance bond issued to CP in respect of the grading and construction work performed by Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Parties</TI>
<P>5. CP is a federal corporation that carries on business across Canada as a provider of rail transportation services. CP is extra-provincially registered in Alberta and maintains a head office in Calgary, Alberta.</P>
<P>6. The Defendant, Hatch Corporation (formerly Hatch Mott MacDonald Ltd.) (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario. Hatch carries on business as a consulting engineering and construction project implementation firm, supplying engineering, project management and construction services to the mining, energy and infrastructure industries. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>7. The Defendant, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia. Thurber carries on business as an engineering firm providing geotechnical, environmental and materials engineering and field and laboratory testing services. Thurber provided geotechnical investigation services as well as geotechnical engineering and engineering design services for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>8. The Defendant, Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), is a federal corporation with its registered office in Regina, Saskatchewan. Clifton carries on business as an engineering firm providing civil, environmental and geotechnical and materials engineering and field and laboratory testing. Clifton provided geotechnical investigation and engineering services as well as construction management and supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>9. The Defendant, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), is a Saskatchewan corporation with its registered office in Estevan, Saskatchewan. KPCL carries on business as a construction contractor, providing construction services and specializing in earthmoving. KPCL was the primary earthworks and construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>10. The Defendant, Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;), is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta. Altus provides survey and forestry services to clients in Alberta, Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada. Altus' general partner, Altus Geomatics General Partner Corporation, is an Alberta corporation with its head office in Edmonton, Alberta. Altus provided ongoing geomatic engineering and survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>11. The Defendant, Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), is a federally incorporated insurance company carrying on business as a registered provider of insurance products, including performance bonds, in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and elsewhere.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Background</TI>
<P>12. In 2012, CP took steps to begin the Belle Plaine Project, including acquiring the necessary land, tendering proposals and negotiating contracts, including contracts with certain of the Defendant Contractors, for the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>13. In July 2013, CP finalized the agreement with K+S under which CP was to provide transportation services for potash from the K+S Bethune mine. The Belle Plaine Project provided a new section of track connecting the K+S Bethune mine to CP's existing rail line.</P>
<P>14. The Belle Plaine Project involved a crossing of the Qu'Appelle River Valley approximately 3.7 kilometers long. The crossing included a multi-span bridge connecting the east and west banks of the Qu'Appelle River Valley that required high grade earth embankments as part of its design.</P>
<P>15. Specific locations along the Belle Plaine Project are described with reference to their station, meaning their distance in kilometers and meters from the CP mainline, starting at 0+000 in Belle Plaine and terminating at 30+281 at the end of CP's portion of the spur. The Qu'Appelle River crossing was at approximately 25+000, with the embankments on either side of the river extending approximately two kilometers in each direction.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Design and Construction of the Belle Plaine Project</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Design</EM></TI>
<P>16. Beginning in 2012, Hatch was responsible for engineering and the overall design of the Belle Plaine Project, including the geometric design and elevation profile for the embankments required at the Qu'Appelle River crossing, and geotechnical investigation and analysis. This work was done in accordance with a proposal Hatch submitted to CP on or about August 15, 2012, which was updated on or about November 29, 2013, that outlined Hatch's proposed involvement in the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>17. In addition to providing engineering and design services, Hatch assisted CP with procurement, including but not limited to preparing Requests for Qualifications (&ldquo;<BOLD>RFQs</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Requests for Proposals (&ldquo;<BOLD>RFPs</BOLD>&rdquo;), and with soliciting and recommending bids for additional engineering work, including geotechnical engineering, and for the construction services required for the Belle Plaine Project. Hatch also assisted in the evaluation of potential service providers and, once those service providers had been selected, assisted in reviewing and evaluating the work they performed.</P>
<P>18. In or about December 2012, Hatch retained Thurber to provide geotechnical advice regarding engineering design, including the design of the earth embankments and the side bridge abutments and approach slopes adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River, and to conduct geological and geotechnical testing of the Belle Plaine Project site. On or about April 15, 2013 Thurber provided a preliminary geotechnical engineering assessment of the area. Subsequently, on or about October 18, 2013, Thurber provided an initial geotechnical design for the Belle Plaine Project. To prepare the geotechnical assessment and design, field testing of the Belle Plaine at the project site was required. Thurber was also involved in collecting geological and geotechnical data for the Belle Plaine Project, carrying out testing at the site, including borehole drilling and logging, test pits, cone penetration tests, and construction of a test fill embankment, and analyzing and assessing the results of that testing as part of the overall geotechnical engineering design of the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>19. After considering available engineering approaches for the design of the Belle Plaine Project and the embankments at the Qu'Appelle River, Thurber recommended that CP proceed based on the observational method of engineering design, described below.</P>
<P>20. In early 2013, CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project. Clifton recommended certain changes to the geotechnical and engineering design, including to the drainage design recommended by Thurber. Clifton endorsed Timber's recommendation that the Belle Plaine Project proceed based on the observational method of engineering design.</P>
<P>21. The observational method of engineering design involves continuous monitoring and review during design and construction. Based on that monitoring and review, design modifications are implemented throughout the course of the project, including during construction, based on observation and analysis of field data, with the design model being adjusted on an ongoing basis by the entity tasked with implementing the observational method.</P>
<P>22. Construction of an embankment using the observational method involves building up height by adding controlled, specified amounts of fill where and when such placement is safe as determined by analysis of observed conditions. The fill and foundation soils are monitored and the stresses within the foundation soils and existing fill created by the newly placed fill are measured and analyzed to determine the rate at which further fill can be safely added to the embankment structure.</P>
<P>23. The observational method incorporates a margin that is intended to ensure the safety of the design and construction known as a factor of safety (&ldquo;<BOLD>FOS</BOLD>&rdquo;). In embankment construction, the FOS is intended to ensure that the design factors resisting an embankment failure outweigh the factors driving such a failure by a margin sufficient to ensure safe construction.</P>
<P>24. Proper implementation of the observational method requires, amongst other things:
<P1>(a) sufficient site investigation to establish the general nature, pattern and properties of the soils at the site;</P1>
<P1>(b) assessment of the most probable and most unfavorable conditions that will be experienced during construction;</P1>
<P1>(c) preparing, in advance of construction, a course of action or modification to the design to mitigate against observed findings that deviate significantly from the expected findings relative to the design model;</P1>
<P1>(d) monitoring and evaluating the actual conditions during construction; and</P1>
<P1>(e) applying the previously developed mitigation strategies to suit the actual conditions.</P1></P>
<P>25. On or about April 17, 2014, CP issued an RFQ seeking submissions from general contractors in respect of construction and project management services for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>26. After having assessed the qualifications of contractors who responded to the RFQ, on October 28, 2014, CP issued an RFP with respect to the construction and project management of the Belle Plaine Project. On December 5, 2014, KPCL submitted a proposal in response to this request in respect of construction, grading and earthworks for the Belle Plaine Project (the <BOLD>&ldquo;KPCL Proposal&rdquo;</BOLD>). Based on the information and representations contained in the KPCL Proposal, CP selected KPCL as the general contractor for the Belle Plaine Project, with responsibility for all aspects of construction and project management.</P>
<P>27. On or about March 17, 2015, as part of the transition to the construction phase, CP issued an RFP seeking proposals for professional engineering services for the development of the Belle Plaine Project. Amongst other things, the work covered by this RFP included geotechnical support and grade construction supervision as well as quality control testing, with an option for the proponent to include daily survey services for alignment, grade and quantity calculations.</P>
<P>28. Clifton submitted a proposal in respect of the construction phase of the Belle Plaine Project on March 31, 2015 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;). Based on the information and representations contained in the Clifton Proposal, CP selected Clifton to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>29. Clifton became the geotechnical engineer of record for the Belle Plaine Project on April 8, 2015. As such, Clifton was to provide the ongoing geotechnical engineering services needed to implement the observational design methodology during construction of the project. In addition, Clifton was to supervise and manage the construction of the Belle Plaine Project, including providing direction and supervision to KPCL, the construction contractor, to ensure the safe and appropriate implementation of the observational method during the construction.</P>
<P>30. Hatch continued to be responsible for project management and co-ordination, profile and alignment design, detailed design, co-ordination with Clifton to ensure that geotechnical recommendations were incorporated into the design and preparation of Issued for Construction (&ldquo;<BOLD>IFC</BOLD>&rdquo;) drawings and specifications.</P>
<P>31. Hatch signed and stamped the engineering drawings for the construction of the Belle Plaine Project.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Construction and Continuing Design</EM></TI>
<P>32. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project began on April 8, 2015, when KPCL and its subcontractors began preparing the site.</P>
<P>33. KPCL was responsible for construction of the Belle Plaine Project earthworks, including the embankments, as well as for overseeing the work of other construction contractors working on the Belle Plaine Project. At all times during the construction period, KPCL had access to one or more areas in which to continue construction.</P>
<P>34. Between May 2015 and December 4, 2015, KPCL carried out construction work on the embankment on the east side of the Qu'Appelle River between 23+000 and 25+000 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>35. KPCL constructed the Embankment by placing a series of layers or lifts of earth, referred to as fill, increasing the height of the Embankment with the addition of each lift. As additional layers were placed, the existing fill and foundational soils were compacted by pressure from the newly added fill, and by mechanical compaction of the fill after it was placed.</P>
<P>36. Altus provided survey services during the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. Altus received direction from Clifton regarding the availability designations for the construction zones and was responsible for surveying the construction site and marking the zones according to their availability for construction.</P>
<P>37. The observational method was to be implemented under Clifton's supervision and direction. Clifton monitored the soil conditions during construction of the Belle Plaine Project with a variety of devices including vibrating wire piezometers, settlement plates, borros anchors, slope inclinometers and alignment pins (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Monitoring Equipment</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>38. Clifton and Altus used the Monitoring Equipment to monitor the stability of the Embankment and the underlying foundation soils during the course of constructing the Embankment. Using that information, Clifton determined where additional work on the Embankment could and could not take place. Clifton was responsible for communicating that information to both Altus and KPCL so that available construction locations could be marked by Altus and then utilized by KPCL to continue construction of the Embankment.</P>
<P>39. The Monitoring Equipment measured the lateral movement, soil settlement and pore water pressure in the foundation soils and the Embankment fill. The data from the Monitoring Equipment was to be collected every 24 hours.</P>
<P>40. Clifton was responsible for installing the Monitoring Equipment as well as for collecting and analyzing data from the Monitoring Equipment. KPCL and Altus provided assistance to Clifton in the placement and installation of the Monitoring Equipment.</P>
<P>41. Based on the data collected from the Monitoring Equipment, and its professional analysis and interpretation of that data, Clifton designated specific zones in the Belle Plaine Project area according to their availability for construction work by KPCL and its sub-contractors. The designations indicated areas in which:
<P1>(a) No fill placement was permitted;</P1>
<P1>(b) Limited or restricted fill placement was permitted; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Fill placement was permitted.</P1></P>
<P>42. Clifton provided direction to KPCL regarding these designations, which signified the zones available to KPCL for grading and construction, both directly and through Altus.</P>
<P>43. Based on its analysis of the information from the Monitoring Equipment, Clifton designated various points along the Embankment as areas in which no fill was permitted in the period between October 26, 2015 and November 24, 2015. Subsequently, although pore water pressures in the Embankment did not decrease as much as expected during the period in which no fill placement was permitted, Clifton permitted KPCL to place an additional meter of fill in the Embankment area beginning after November 24, 2015.</P>
<P>44. Clifton and KPCL were aware that the pore water pressure readings in the vicinity of the Embankment were a concern. At several points during construction, including on October 29, 2015 and November 13, 2015, Clifton directed KPCL to refrain from placing further fill in specific areas along the Embankment due to the high pore water pressures. Moreover, Clifton was aware of the possibility that there was a clay layer in the foundation soils that was not adequately draining and which was contributing to the pore water pressure concern and that a weak layer such as this could cause instability.</P>
<P>45. In or about November 2015, Clifton recommended reducing the FOS from 1.3 to 1.2 to allow an increased amount of fill to be placed before construction work on the Belle Plaine Project was stopped for the winter. CP relied on Clifton's advice that these changes to the FOS were appropriate for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>46. Throughout this period, Clifton was aware that certain instruments in the Monitoring Equipment had not been operating properly since at least September 29, 2015. Defects in, and failures of, the Monitoring Equipment continued through October and November 2015. In the week prior to December 5, 2015, Clifton was aware that critical Monitoring Equipment in the Embankment area was not performing properly. Clifton nonetheless provided KPCL with directions to continue with construction in the area of the Embankment.</P>
<P>47. For example, despite being aware of the potential for instability due to a weak clay layer of soil in the foundational soils beneath the Embankment, on November 24, 2015, Clifton directed KPCL to place additional fill between 24+800 and 24+925. Similarly, although Clifton was aware that the pore water pressures in this area of the Embankment were still high and that the estimated FOS was just 1.1, on November 27, 2015, Clifton directed KPCL to place further fill between 24+700 and 24+950.</P>
<P>48. Clifton continued to designate parts of the Embankment as an area in which no fill placement was permitted as of December 1, 2015, however, contrary to the expectations and principles upon which the engineering design for the Embankment was based, the pore water pressure in the area continued to increase.</P>
<P>49. Despite the continued increase in pore water pressure, at no point during construction of the Belle Plaine Project did Clifton recommend removing fill from the Embankment to reduce the load upon the foundation soils or taking any other steps to respond to the increased pore water pressure readings.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Embankment Failure</TI>
<P>50. On December 5, 2015, CP personnel arrived at the Belle Plaine Project site at approximately 7:00 a.m. and discovered that the Embankment had dropped by several meters. The Embankment continued to drop through the day, eventually affecting close to a full kilometer of construction works and extending to approximately 25m below the Embankment's pre-failure height (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Embankment Failure was sudden and progressive, with the berm failing first, followed immediately by the core of the Embankment.</P>
<P>51. The Embankment Failure was a lateral, spreading failure that progressed from south to north on the east bank of the Qu'Appelle River, eventually damaging the Embankment between 23+924 and 24+700, nearly a full kilometer of construction works.</P>
<P>52. The occurrence of the Embankment Failure was immediately obvious. By the end of December 5, 2015, an area approximately 170 meters wide, 630 meters long and between 10 and 30 meters deep had been affected. In total, approximately 3.2 million cubic meters of material was displaced as a result of the Embankment Failure.</P>
<P>53. The effects of the Embankment Failure are depicted in the following photographs:
<P1><GRAPHIC FILENAME="2018ALTA32741.BMP"><LINKTEXT>Graphic 1</LINKTEXT></GRAPHIC></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Remediation</TI>
<P>54. CP, acting as a prudent project owner, immediately began to investigate the Embankment Failure and to assess the available to remediation options.</P>
<P>55. CP also immediately arranged for mass unloading of the Embankment to prevent further migration of the Embankment Failure and to avoid further compromise to the fill that had been placed for the approach to the Qu'Appelle River crossing.</P>
<P>56. Although the Embankment was stabilized after the Embankment Failure, the foundational soils in the area were weakened significantly by the Embankment Failure, with the result that CP was required to redesign the Embankment so that it could be safely constructed on the newly weakened soils.</P>
<P>57. After carefully evaluating the options available for reconstruction, and after taking into account the weakened foundation soils caused by the Embankment Failure, CP elected to proceed with a design aligned further to the west and with an elevation 3 meters lower than the original plan, with berms extending further outwards in both directions from the main Embankment.</P>
<P>58. In addition to the engineering costs arising from the need to assess, stabilize and redesign the Embankment, as a result of the Embankment Failure CP incurred the cost of constructing the redesigned Embankment, together with additional costs, including environmental management costs, necessitated by the larger footprint of the redesigned Embankment.</P>
<P>59. The reconstruction of the Embankment was largely complete as of February 2017.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Hatch</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Hatch Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>60. In January 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch that was effective January 1, 2012 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;). Hatch's proposed scope of work for the Belle Plaine Project was set out in a proposal memorandum submitted by Hatch to CP on August 15, 2012 and in the development proposal submitted by Hatch to CP on November 29, 2013. Hatch and CP set out the services Hatch was to provide in respect of the Belle Plaine Project in a series of work orders (collectively with the Hatch Contract, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>61. Hatch described itself as &ldquo;CP's prime contractor&rdquo; for the Belle Plaine Project. As part of its scope of work, Hatch was responsible for assisting in establishing the routing of the Belle Plaine Project rail line and for initial feasibility studies, as well as overall project engineering for the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>62. The laws of the Province of Alberta govern the Hatch Agreement and by virtue of the Hatch Agreement, Hatch has attorned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>63. Under the Hatch Agreement, Hatch was responsible for the overall design of the Belle Plaine project. Hatch's responsibilities included, but were not limited to:
<P1>(a) feasibility studies and reports;</P1>
<P1>(b) providing a conceptual design for the Belle Plaine project, including drainage and grading design;</P1>
<P1>(c) geotechnical investigations and design;</P1>
<P1>(d) preparation and review of RFPs and contracts; and</P1>
<P1>(e) risk assessments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) providing civil design support including embankment geometry and other drainage design work (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Work</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1></P>
<P>64. Further, having stamped the engineering drawings, Hatch was professionally responsible for the design of the Belle Plaine Project, including the Embankment.</P>
<P>65. Under the Hatch Agreement, Hatch is liable to CP for, amongst other things, any and all losses, costs, damages and expenses arising out of or resulting from acts or omissions of Hatch or its sub-contractors under the Hatch Agreement, and for any breach by Hatch or its sub-contractors of the Hatch Agreement.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Hatch's Duties to CP</EM></TI>
<P>66. It was an express or implied term of the Hatch Agreement that the Hatch Work would be provided in a safe, efficient and professional manner and in accordance with all applicable contractual, professional and industry standards. It was a further express or implied term of the Hatch Agreement that the Hatch Work would be based on engineering methodology suitable for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>67.

<P>84. Under the Clifton Agreement, Clifton is liable to CP for, amongst other things, any and all losses, costs, damages and expenses arising out of or resulting from acts or omissions by Clifton and/or its subcontractors under the Clifton Agreement, and for any breaches of the Clifton Agreement by Clifton and/or its sub-contractors.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Clifton's Duties to CP</EM></TI>
<P>85. Pursuant to the Clifton Agreement, Clifton owed CP a duty to complete the Clifton Work as contractually specified. Further, it was an express or implied term of the Clifton Agreement that the Clifton Work would be completed in a safe, efficient and professional manner and would comply with all applicable professional and industry standards. In the event that the Clifton Work was not performed in a safe, efficient and professional manner and in accordance with the Clifton Agreement, Clifton was required to redo the Clifton Work at no additional cost to CP.</P>
<P>86. Further, or in the alternative, Clifton owed CP a duty of care to provide the Clifton Work in a manner that was suitable and safe for the Belle Plaine Project construction environment and in accordance with applicable professional and industry standards. It was, or ought to have been, reasonably foreseeable to Clifton that negligent performance of the Clifton Work would cause serious loss and damage to CP.</P>
<P>87. Under the Clifton Agreement, Clifton was required to obtain and maintain specific types of insurance. In particular, Clifton was required to obtain professional liability coverage with a limit of $5,000,000.</P>
<P>88. In addition, Clifton was required to exercise the degree of care, skill, diligence and competence expected of an ordinary, reasonable, competent, cautious and prudent engineering firm in the circumstances. With respect to the Belle Plaine Project and the Embankment, these duties included, but were not limited to, duties to:

<P1>(i) implement the observational method appropriately and in accordance with the standard expected of a professional engineering firm, including, but not limited to, by failing to:
<P2>(i) recommend Monitoring Equipment that was appropriate for the Belle Plaine Project and, in particular, suitable for use in the implementation of the observational method;</P2>
<P2>(ii) ensure that the Monitoring Equipment used was suitable and appropriate, taking into account the location and the construction methodology to be employed;</P2>
<P2>(iii) ensure that the Monitoring Equipment was properly installed and monitored;</P2>
<P2>(iv) collect the information from the Monitoring Equipment required for the proper implementation of the observational method;</P2>
<P2>(v) pay any, or sufficient, attention to information collected from the Monitoring Equipment;</P2>
<P2>(vi) properly analyze and consider information from the Monitoring Equipment and/or to incorporate that information into the ongoing design of the Embankment;</P2>
<P2>(vii) give any or sufficient, consideration to the significance of ongoing and repeated failures of the Monitoring Equipment and/or to consider the impact of the absence of information from the Monitoring Equipment on the implementation of the observational method;</P2>
<P2>(viii) ensure that adequate procedures to prevent damage to the Monitoring Equipment were in place during installation of the Monitoring Equipment and construction of the Embankment;</P2></P1>
<P1>(j) ensure that fill was placed in locations and/or at a rate compatible with the safe construction of the Embankment;</P1>
<P1>(k) provide adequate supervision and direction to KPCL in the construction of the Embankment;</P1>
<P1>(l) have any, or sufficient, system of controls in place over the demarcation of zones available for construction;</P1>
<P1>(m) obtain professional liability insurance with a coverage limit of $5,000,000 as mandated by the Clifton Agreement;</P1>

<P1>(o) such further and other breaches of contract and/or of the duty of care owed to CP as may be established at the trial of this action.</P1></P>
<P>90. Clifton's negligence and breach of contract caused or materially contributed to the Embankment Failure, in turn causing damages to CP, which were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Clifton's negligence and/or breach of contract.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Clifton's Misrepresentations</EM></TI>
<P>91. At all times, Clifton was aware of the significance of the Clifton Work, having acknowledged in the Clifton Proposal that the importance of strong geotechnical support for Belle Plaine Project could not be overstated.</P>
<P>92. Amongst other things, in the Clifton Proposal, Clifton represented that it had extensive experience in installing and maintaining instrumentation to monitor pore water pressure, settlement, slope stability, and deformation of earthworks including real time, remote reading monitoring systems and that survey data would be downloaded and checked daily (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Proposal Misrepresentations</BOLD>&rdquo;). In making the Proposal Misrepresentations, Clifton implicitly represented that it would ensure that the Monitoring Equipment was appropriate for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project and that the Monitoring Equipment would provide the data and information necessary for the successful implementation of the observational method (together with the Proposal Misrepresentations, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Misrepresentations</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>93. Clifton knew or ought to have known that CP was, in the course of relying upon Clifton to implement the observational method of design properly, relying upon Clifton properly to collect all appropriate and necessary data from the Monitoring Equipment, interpret the necessary data from Monitoring Equipment, and incorporate that information and analysis into the design and construction of the Embankment.</P>
<P>94. Clifton was negligent in making the Clifton Misrepresentations. In particular:
<P1>(a) by virtue of, among other things, the Clifton Agreement and Clifton's recognition of the importance of its work to the success of the Belle Plaine Project, Clifton and CP had a &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) the Clifton Misrepresentations were untrue, inaccurate, or misleading. Among other things:
<P2>(i) Clifton did not take any, or any adequate, steps to assess the suitability of the Monitoring Equipment for use on the Belle Plaine Project or to assess whether there was sufficient Monitoring Equipment in place;</P2>
<P2>(ii) Clifton did not take any, or any adequate, steps to ensure that the Monitoring Equipment would provide the data and information needed to successfully implement the observational method prior to and/or during construction on the Belle Project; and</P2>
<P2>(iii) the Monitoring Equipment was not suitable for use in the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project.</P2></P1></P>
<P>95. Clifton knew, or ought to have known, that the Monitoring Equipment was susceptible to significant stresses during installation and construction due to the nature of the soils in which the Monitoring Equipment was placed and/or the construction methods used on the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>96. CP reasonably relied on one or more of the Clifton Misrepresentations in accepting the recommendation to design the Embankment using the observational method of engineering design, which necessarily involved the proper function and monitoring of the Monitoring Equipment.</P>
<P>97. CP suffered damages arising from its reasonable reliance on the Clifton Misrepresentations, which caused or materially contributed to the Embankment Failure and to the damages CP incurred as a result of the Embankment Failure.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>KPCL</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The KPCL Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>98. On or about September 9, 2013 CP and Hatch distributed an RFQ seeking potential general contractors for the Belle Plaine Project. The RFQ was re-circulated on April 17, 2014. The RFQ set out CP's objectives for the Belle Plaine Project, which included retaining a general contractor that could deliver the work safely, efficiently and effectively and who would construct the project to state-of-practice quality and safety standards. The general contractor was to be responsible for all aspects of construction, project management, safety, traffic management, testing and commissioning. The RFQ also set out CP's requirements as to specific types of insurance required of potential contractors, as well as the minimum amounts of coverage required.</P>
<P>99. This was followed by an RFP from CP, as a result of which KPCL was selected the primary construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project and was responsible construction of the Embankment.</P>
<P>100. CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with KPCL that was effective March 12, 2015 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;). The scope of KPCL's work under the KPCL Agreement encompassed all services necessary for the construction of the Belle Plaine Project, including the construction of approximately 31 kilometers of railway grade with an estimated 7.2 million cubic meters of earth excavation and an estimated 6.7 million cubic meters of embankment construction (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Work</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>101. KPCL's Work included all aspects of construction, project management and safety, as well as supervision of the construction contractors on Belle Plaine Project. KPCL was also responsible for providing a quality management system to control construction quality and for daily tracking and reporting regarding the construction work that had been performed.</P>
<P>102. Under the KPCL Agreement, KPCL was responsible for providing the services necessary to complete the KPCL Work to the satisfaction of CP. KPCL was also required to protect the KPCL Work from damage and was responsible for damage arising as a result of its operations.</P>
<P>103. At all times, KPCL controlled the KPCL Work and was responsible for determining the most effective and appropriate construction methods for the KPCL work, including for the construction of the Embankment.</P>
<P>104. KPCL was responsible for the means, method, technique and procedures used in the construction of the Embankment, as well as for the implementation of the construction method it selected. KPCL was also responsible for coordination of the services to fulfill the KPCL Agreement, including ensuring that it and its subcontractors obtained and complied with directions from Clifton as to the availability for construction of zones within the construction site.</P>
<P>105. The KPCL Agreement required KPCL to obtain insurance, including all-risk builder's risk or course of construction insurance sufficient to cover events such as the Embankment Failure and covering the KPCL Work for the full replacement value of the KPCL Work and the material used therein. The KPCL Agreement also required KPCL to bear any loss or damage to incomplete KPCL Work that was not covered by the required policy of builder's risk/course of construction insurance and required KPCL to restore any of the KPCL work that sustained such loss or damage.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>KPCL's Duties to CP</EM></TI>
<P>106. It was an express or implied term of the KPCL Agreement that the KPCL Work would be completed in accordance with the KPCL Agreement and in a safe and efficient manner suitable for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project. It was a further express or implied term of the KPCL Agreement that the KPCL Work would comply with all applicable professional, statutory and industry standards.</P>
<P>107. Further, or in the alternative, KPCL owed CP a common law duty to perform the KPCL Work in a manner that was suitable and safe for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project and in accordance with professional, statutory and industry standards. It was, or ought to have been, reasonably foreseeable to KPCL that negligent performance of the KPCL Work would cause serious loss and damage to CP.</P>
<P>108. KPCL's duties to CP under the KPCL Agreement and at common law included, but were not limited to, obligations to:
<P1>(a) perform the KPCL Work diligently and in a good and workmanlike manner;</P1>
<P1>(b) select and implement a construction method appropriate for the safe, efficient and professional construction of the Belle Plaine Project, including the Embankment;</P1>
<P1>(c) implement and follow an adequate quality management system during construction of the Belle Plaine Project, including but not limited to ensuring the appropriate placement of fill during construction of the Embankment;</P1>
<P1>(d) ensure that the Belle Plaine Project was safely constructed in accordance with the directions as to construction provided by Clifton and all other applicable specifications;</P1>
<P1>(e) protect the Embankment from potential damage during construction;</P1>
<P1>(f) protect the Monitoring Equipment during installation of the Monitoring Equipment and during construction;</P1>
<P1>(g) ensure that fill height and fill placement were appropriate and in accordance with directions provided by Clifton;</P1>
<P1>(h) comply with directions and instructions from Clifton regarding where construction and grading work could be performed; and</P1>
<P1>(i) such further and other duties as may be proven at trial.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>KPCL's Breach of Contract and Negligence</EM></TI>
<P>109. KPCL breached its contractual and common law duties to CP. KPCL's breaches of its contractual and common law obligations included but are not limited to, failing to:
<P1>(a) ensure that the KPCL Work complied with all applicable professional, statutory and industry standards;</P1>
<P1>(b) select a construction method for the KPCL Work on the Embankment that was appropriate for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project and for the construction of the Embankment;</P1>
<P1>(c) obtain builder's risk/course of construction insurance covering the full replacement value of the KPCL Work;</P1>
<P1>(d) ensure that adequate procedures to prevent damage to the Embankment were in place during the construction of the Belle Plaine Project;</P1>
<P1>(e) ensure that adequate procedures to prevent damage to the Monitoring Equipment were in place during the installation of the Monitoring Equipment and/or during the construction of the Belle Plaine Project;</P1>
<P1>(f) comply with the directions and specifications developed by Clifton for the construction of the Belle Plaine Project, including those governing the placement of fill and the amount of fill that could be placed;</P1>
<P1>(g) obtain the information needed for compliance with directions as to fill placement developed by Clifton, and, in particular, the information necessary to ensure that KPCL was at all times performing the KPCL Work in areas designated as available for work by Clifton;</P1>
<P1>(h) implement and follow an adequate quality management program, including a program to track, monitor and ensure the placement of fill in accordance with Clifton's directions;</P1>
<P1>(i) warn CP of the risks associated with the constructed method it had selected; and</P1>
<P1>(j) such further and other breaches as may be established at the trial of this action.</P1></P>
<P>110. KPCL's negligence and breach of contract caused or materially contributed to the Embankment Failure, in turn causing damages to CP, which were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of KPCL's negligence and/or breach of contract.</P>
<P>111. Further, KPCL's failure to obtain course of construction insurance as required by the KPCL Agreement has given rise to additional losses, damages, costs and expenses to CP.</P>
<P>112. Under the KPCL Agreement, in addition to other types of insurance coverage, KPCL was to obtain all risk course of construction coverage for the full replacement value of the KPCL Work that named both KPCL and CP as insureds. Although KPCL obtained some of the requisite insurance through its insurance broker, Marsh Canada, it failed to obtain course of construction insurance. Had KPCL obtained the requisite insurance, CP would have been in a position to recoup its losses in relation to the Embankment Failure through that insurer. KPCL's breach of its contractual obligation to obtain this coverage has resulted in the need for CP to seek recovery of its losses directly against those who were responsible. This, in turn, requires CP to establish not only the occurrence of property damage, as it would have had to have done under a course of construction policy, but to establish fault on the part of one or more of the Defendants, which would have been unnecessary had the proper insurance been purchased as required under the KPCL Agreement.</P>
<P>113. To the extent that anything remains owing to KPCL under the KPCL Agreement, CP claims set-off of such amounts as against the damages it sustained as a result of the Embankment Failure.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Altus</TI>
<P>114. After receiving an informal RFP from CP, Altus provided a proposal in respect of the Belle Plaine Project on November 3, 2014 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Altus Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>115. In or about March 2015, CP engaged Altus to provide the survey services outlined in the Altus Proposal, with specific direction to be provided to Altus by Clifton during the construction process, giving rise to an agreement between CP and Altus with respect to these services (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Altus Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>116. Under the Altus Proposal, Altus was to provide services for the Belle Plaine Project, including:
<P1>(a) Construction staking, including grade staking for stripping limits, subgrade, sub-ballast, and ballast;</P1>
<P1>(b) Topographic surveys;</P1>
<P1>(c) Volume reporting for subgrade material, sub-ballast, and ballast;</P1>
<P1>(d) As-built surveys; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Survey-support services, including supervision by a professional land surveyor, computations and drafting (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Altus Work</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1></P>
<P>117. In addition, Altus was responsible for assisting with the placement of Monitoring Equipment.</P>
<P>118. As part of construction staking, Altus was responsible for marking the areas in which Monitoring Equipment was to be placed, as well as for staking the areas where fill placement was permitted.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Altus' Duties to CP</EM></TI>
<P>119. It was an express or implied term of the Altus Agreement that the Altus Work would be completed in a safe, professional and efficient manner suitable for the construction environment of the Belle Plaine Project and which complied with all applicable professional, statutory and industry standards.</P>
<P>120. Further, or in the alternative, Altus owed CP a common law duty of care to perform the Altus Work in a manner that was safe, efficient and suitable for the construction environment of the Belle professional and industry standards. It was, or ought to have been, reasonably foreseeable to Altus that negligent performance of the Altus Work would cause serious loss and damage to CP.</P>
<P>121. Altus' duties to CP under the Altus Agreement and at common law included, but were not limited to, obligations to:
<P1>(a) Perform the Altus Work diligently and in a good and workmanlike manner;</P1>
<P1>(b) comply with directions and instructions from Clifton regarding the demarcation of zones in the construction site in accordance with Clifton's designations;</P1>
<P1>(c) ensure that staking done was in accordance with the Hatch design and the specific directions provided by Clifton; and</P1>
<P1>(d) implement an adequate system of controls over surveying and marking the zones in the construction site in accordance with Clifton's designations.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Altus' Breach of Contract and Negligence</EM></TI>
<P>122. Altus breached its contractual and common law duties to CP. Altus' breaches of its contractual and common law obligations include, but are not limited to, failing to:

<P1>(b) have any, or any sufficient, system of controls in place over the demarcation of zones indicating availability for construction;</P1>
<P1>(c) comply with directions and instructions from Clifton regarding the designation of zones in the construction area according to their availability for construction;</P1>
<P1>(d) ensure that the survey conducted was consistent with the plan stationing as set out by Hatch in the Belle Plaine Project design; and</P1>
<P1>(e) ensure that it was staking the construction site based on the appropriate alignment drawings.</P1></P>
<P>123. Altus' negligence and breach of contract caused or materially contributed to the Embankment Failure, in turn causing damages to CP, which were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Altus' negligence and/or breach of contract.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Intact</TI>
<P>124. On or about May 28, 2015 the Defendant, Intact, issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX to KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP in respect of the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Agreement.</P>
<P>125. The Performance Bond requires Intact to act upon the surety provided where:
<P1>(a) KPCL is in default under the KPCL Agreement;</P1>
<P1>(b) CP declares KPCL to be in default under the Performance Bond; and</P1>
<P1>(c) CP has performed its obligations under the KPCL Agreement.</P1></P>
<P>126. As set out above at paragraphs 109&ndash;113, KPCL was and is in default under the KPCL Agreement, and CP has declared KPCL to be in default. Despite this, and although CP has observed all of its obligations under the Performance Bond, Intact has refused to honour its obligations.</P>
<P>127. Intact's failure to fulfil the terms of the Performance Bond is a breach of contract that has resulted in damages to CP, the intended beneficiary of the Performance Bond, arising from the need to reconstruct the Embankment following the Embankment Failure.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Real and Substantial Connection</TI>
<P>128. There is a real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which this Action is based. In particular:
<P1>(a) the claim relates to contracts made in Alberta;</P1>
<P1>(b) the claim relates to contracts governed by Alberta law;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch and Clifton have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts;</P1>
<P1>(d) the Defendants who are resident outside of Alberta are necessary and proper parties to the Action; and</P1>
<P1>(e) such further grounds as may be demonstrated in the course of this Action.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Damages Suffered by CP</TI>
<P>129. As a direct and foreseeable result of the breaches of contract, negligence and misrepresentations of the Defendants, CP has suffered damages including, but not limited to:
<P1>(a) costs associated with the redesign and reconstruction work required due to the Embankment Failure in an amount currently estimated of at least $39,500,000;</P1>
<P1>(b) to perform internal and third party investigations to assess and investigate the Embankment Failure and the available options for remediation in an amount currently estimated to be $1,500,000.00;</P1>
<P1>(c) such further and other damages as may be proven at trial.</P1></P>
<P>130. The Plaintiff proposes that the trial of this action be held in Calgary, Alberta and does not expect that the trial will exceed 25 days.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Remedy sought:</TI>
<P>131. Wherefore the Plaintiff claims as against the Defendants, jointly and severally:
<P1>(a) Judgment for damages in the sum of $41,000,000 or such other amount as may be proven at the trial of this action;</P1>
<P1>(b) Interest pursuant to the <EM>Judgment Interest Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-1 as amended;</P1>
<P1>(c) Costs of this action; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may consider appropriate.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT(S)</TI>
<P>You only have a short time to do something to defend yourself against this claim:
<P1>20 days if you are served in Alberta</P1>
<P1>1 month if you are served outside Alberta but in Canada</P1>
<P1>2 months if you are served outside Canada.</P1></P>
<P>You can respond by filing a statement of defence or a demand for notice in the office of the clerk of the Court of Queen's Bench at Calgary, Alberta, AND serving your statement of defence or a demand for notice on the plaintiff's(s') address for service.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>WARNING</TI>
<P>If you do not file and serve a statement of defence or a demand for notice within your time period, you risk losing the law suit automatically. If you do not file, or do not serve, or are late in doing either of these things, a court may give a judgment to the plaintiff(s) against you.</P></BLOCK2>

</TBLBODY>
</SGMLTBL>
</TABLE></P>
<P><BOLD>Note: State below only facts and not evidence (Rule 13.6)</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Statement of facts relied on:</TI>
<P>1. Except where herein after expressly admitted, the Defendant, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;Thurber&rdquo;), denies each and every allegation set forth in the Statement of Claim as if the same were set out separately herein and denied.</P>
<P>2. The Terms used in the Statement of Defence and not otherwise defined have the same meaning ascribed to them in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. In reply to 71 of the Statement of Claim, and in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, Thurber acknowledges that it entered into the Thurber MSA in January 2012. However, Thurber denies that it provided any geotechnical services to Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;) related to the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to the terms of the Thurber MSA. Thurber further denies that it provided any geotechnical services in relation to the Belle Paine Project pursuant to any contract between Thurber and CP. Alternatively, if geotechnical services in relation to the Belle Plaine Project were provided by Thurber pursuant to a contract with CP, Thurber states that it complied with the terms and its obligations pursuant to any such contract.</P>
<P>4. In reply to paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim and in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, Thurber agrees that it was retained by Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;) pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;Hatch Agreement&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. Pursuant to the Terms of the Hatch Agreement, and all amendments thereto, Thurber provided geotechnical services for the Belle Plaine Project, including geotechnical investigation, testing and design. Thurber states, and the fact is, that it met all of its obligations pursuant to the Hatch Agreement and that any engineering services it provided with respect to the Belle Plaine Project met all applicable and relevant geotechnical engineering standards in place at the time.</P>
<P>6. In specific reply to paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Statement of Claim and in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, Thurber agrees that it was retained by Hatch to provide geotechnical advice regarding engineering design and, specifically, the design of the earth embankments and the bridge abutments and approach slopes adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River (the &ldquo;Embankment Design&rdquo;). Thurber further agrees that it recommended the &ldquo;observational method&rdquo; with respect to the Embankment Design.</P>
<P>7. On or about October 23, 2014, Thurber wrote to Hatch advising that it had reviewed the proposed issue for tender (&ldquo;IFT&rdquo;) drawings for the Belle Plaine Project and noted that the proposed Embankment Design differed from Thurber's recommended design. Thurber warned Hatch that the proposed Embankment Design in the IFT drawings was more aggressive than what Thurber considered to be appropriate and that the construction schedule, which had been shortened considerably from what Thurber had understood it would be, would adversely impact the behaviour of the foundation soils.</P>
<P>8. On or about January 15, 2015, Thurber again advised Hatch (and CP) that it had significant concerns with the proposed Embankment Design. Thurber noted that Embankment Design decisions were being made that would increase the risk profile rather than reducing it. Thurber noted that its specific concerns included:
<ITEM><P>Raising the maximum embankment height from &tilde; 24 meters to &tilde; 29 meters;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Compressing the construction schedule from two years to one year; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Allowing placement of fill material during the winter months.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>9. Thurber further advised that, as a result of the concerns identified above, localized slope failures could occur during (or immediately following) construction.</P>
<P>10. On or about February 10, 2015, Thurber provided Hatch with its recommended instrumentation plan to support the observational method during construction of the embankment fill. Thurber noted that its plan was to design to monitor how the embankment behaved as it was being constructed. If the data collected was found to be unfavorable, Thurber noted it would be necessary to modify the design, method or length of construction to maintain stability of the embankment. Thurber further identified possible remedial measures that could be required.</P>
<P>11. On or about April 6, 2015, Thurber wrote to Hatch and CP again raising its concern that the proposed Embankment Design was not sufficient to maintain an appropriate factor of safety based on Thurber's review of the soils stability results.</P>
<P>12. On April 8, 2015, two days after Thurber warned both Hatch and CP that the Embankment Design was problematic, CP advised Thurber that it would not continue on as geotechnical engineer of record on the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>13. On or about April 15, 2015, Thurber wrote to CP directly advising that because of the significant design changes that had been made (or would be made) to the rail alignment, the signed and stamped design memoranda that were prepared by Thurber during the tender phase of the project were no longer valid. Thurber reiterated the many concerns it had previously raised regarding the proposed Embankment Design and advised CP that the new geotechnical engineering firm would need to prepare, sign and stamp its own Issued for Construction documents to support their role as a geotechnical engineer of record.</P>
<P>14. Thurber had no further involvement on the Belle Plaine Project and was not involved, in any capacity, during the course of construction.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Any matters that defeat the claim of the Plaintiff:</TI>
<P>15. Thurber denies that CP has suffered any loss or damage, as alleged in the Statement of Claim, or at all. In answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, Thurber denies that it was negligent or in breach of contract as alleged or all and further denies that any act or omission by Thurber caused or contributed to any loss or damage suffered by CP as alleged or at all.</P>
<P>16. Alternatively, if Thurber was negligent or in breach of contract as alleged or at all, which is not admitted but is denied, and if CP suffered any loss or damage as a result, which is not admitted but denied, then all or alternatively some of the loss or damage was due solely or partially to the contributory negligence of CP, the particulars of which include but are not limited to the following:
<P1>(a) Failing to provide Thurber with the information or documentation necessary for Thurber to perform its geotechnical work and services;</P1>
<P1>(b) Failing to follow or heed the advice or multiple warnings issued by Thurber to both CP and Hatch that the Embankment Design was inadequate, insufficient, dangerous and ill-advised;</P1>
<P1>(c) Failing to follow Thurber's advice regarding mitigation of the many identified risks;</P1>
<P1>(d) Failing to retain or hire other qualified design professionals;</P1>
<P1>(e) Failing to follow the advice of any other design professionals that were retained;</P1>
<P1>(f) Failing to properly monitor how the embankment behaved as it was constructed;</P1>
<P1>(g) Failing to conduct appropriate testing and analysis of the embankment soils;</P1>
<P1>(h) Failing to flatten (or berm) the embankment slopes;</P1>
<P1>(i) Failing to place fill at an acceptable rate to allow for proper pore pressure dissipation;</P1>
<P1>(j) Failing to install wicks through the embankment fill into the underlying foundation soils to expedite pore pressure dissipation;</P1>
<P1>(k) Failing to reduce the fill height by lowering the design grade;</P1>
<P1>(l) Raising the embankment height from &tilde; 24 meters to 29 meters;</P1>
<P1>(m) Compressing the construction schedule from 2 years to 1 year;</P1>
<P1>(n) Allowing placement of fill during the winter months; and</P1>
<P1>(o) Such further and other particulars of negligence that will be established at the trial of this action.</P1></P>
<P>17. Further, and in the alternative, CP has failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate the extent of any alleged loss or damage, in whole or in part, such loss or damage being expressly denied.</P>
<P>18. Further, and in the alternative, any alleged damage or loss suffered by CP, which is denied, resulted from the negligence of the other Defendants, the particulars of which are set out in the Statement of Claim. If Thurber is found liable for any claim or damages advanced by CP, in whole or in part, then Thurber claims contribution and indemnity from the other Defendants, the particulars of which will be fully established at the trial of this action.</P>
<P>19. Thurber pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, R.S.A. 2000, c. C-27 and the <EM>Tort Feasors Act</EM>, R.S.A. 2000, c. T-5.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Remedy sought:</TI>
<P>20. Thurber requests that CP's claim be dismissed with costs.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>15. Further, or in the alternative, if CP suffered injury, loss or damage, which is not admitted but denied, then such injury, loss or damage was not caused by, or contributed to by, any negligence or breach on the part of Altus, as alleged or at all.</P>
<P>16. Further, or in the alternative, if CP suffered injury, loss or damage, which is not admitted but denied, then such injury, loss or damage was caused, or contributed to, by CP, particulars of which include:
<P1>(a) CP was contractually responsible to K+S Potash to deliver the Belle Plaine Project within a certain date, which caused CP to exert pressure upon Clifton and KPCL to rush the Belle Plaine Project. CP obtained similar terms from Clifton and KPCL, causing them to install the embankment contrary to good engineering principles;</P1>
<P1>(b) Instructing or permitting Clifton to add subgrade materials at a rate that was unsuitable or unsafe for the Belle Plaine Project;</P1>
<P1>(c) Failing to oversee the work of other contractors on the Belle Plaine Project;</P1>
<P1>(d) Failing to implement the appropriate safety measures for other contractors, on the Belle Plaine Project;</P1>
<P1>(e) Failing to undertake appropriate inspection measures, or any inspection measures, with respect to the Belle Plaine Project; and</P1>
<P1>(f) such further and other particulars of negligence as may be proven at the trial of this action.</P1></P>
<P>17. Further, or in the alternative, if CP suffered injury, loss or damage, which is not admitted but denied, then CP, failed to reasonably mitigate, or mitigate at all, such injury, loss or damage.</P>
<P>18. Further or in the alternative, if CP suffered any losses or damages, which is not admitted but expressly denied, any such losses or damages were not the result of Altus's conduct and are too remote, not foreseeable and otherwise not recoverable.</P>
<P>19. Altus pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c. C-27 and the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c T-5.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Remedy sought:</TI>
<P>20. Altus seeks:
<P1>(a) That CP's claim be dismissed;</P1>
<P1>(b) Costs of this action; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just and appropriate in the circumstances.</P1></P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The question at issue in this appeal is whether a lawsuit that <UNDER>will</UNDER> be litigated in Alberta (with two defendants having attorned to the jurisdiction by filing Statements of Defence and Notices to Co-Defendants) should also be litigated in Saskatchewan to suit the interests of certain other defendants, only one of whom is formally domiciled there.</P>
<P>2. Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), a federal corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, filed the Statement of Claim in this Action on December 1, 2017 and served it on each of the defendants shortly thereafter, in January 2018.</P>
<P>3. In its Statement of Claim, CP sets out causes of action against defendants spread across Canada. The claim involves allegations of breach of contract and negligence arising out of the design and construction of a rail spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan that forms part of CP's national rail network (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP moved forward with its litigation without delay, serving its Statement of Claim on the various defendants between January 8 and January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>4. The defendants are located across Canada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Despite this, certain of the defendants&mdash;including two who have contractually attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;chose to challenge jurisdiction (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;), arguing that this claim has no real and substantial connection to Alberta, and that in any event the claim ought to proceed in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>5. The Jurisdiction Applications proceeded on July 4 and 5, 2018 before Master J.T. Prowse, who issued his decision on July 25, 2018.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Master in Chambers, J.T. Prowse, filed July 25, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Decision</BOLD>&rdquo;), Record of Proceedings at Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Master Prowse correctly determined that the Alberta courts have jurisdiction over this matter on multiple bases, including the presence of defendants served in Alberta, the contractual consent of other defendants, the connection to contracts made in Alberta and the status of the remaining defendants as necessary and proper parties to this Action.</P>
<P>6. Master Prowse erred, however, in concluding that despite the numerous connecting factors between Alberta and this Action, Saskatchewan was a clearly more suitable forum in which to conduct this Action. It is respectfully submitted that this error arose through a mistake in identifying the legal test to be applied in considering the question of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and was compounded by an inappropriate assessment of the factors that should have guided that analysis.</P>
<P>7. Based on his decision that Saskatchewan would be a more suitable forum for this Action, Master Prowse stayed this proceeding against the four defendants who brought Jurisdiction Applications. The Action is, however, unaffected as respects the other two defendants, and will continue in Alberta as against those parties, pursuant to Master Prowse's judgment.</P>
<P>8. Ironically, the effect of Master Prowse's decision is what he himself described as &ldquo;the worst possible outcome, which is concurrent litigation in both provinces, with attendant wasted costs and possible inconsistent verdicts&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at para 54, Record of Proceedings at page A1081.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Master Prowse correctly concluded that the courts of both Alberta and Saskatchewan have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this Action. This does not, however, oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court and, given the strong connection of the parties and the subject matter of this litigation to Alberta, Saskatchewan cannot be shown to be a <UNDER>clearly</UNDER> more appropriate forum, which is the applicable requirement.</P>
<P>10. While the Belle Plaine Project was constructed in Saskatchewan, the bulk of the design and engineering work was completed in Alberta. The majority of those <UNDER>likely</UNDER> to be questioned or to appear as witnesses at trial are either in Alberta or are in jurisdictions other than Saskatchewan, with the result that comparative convenience either favours proceeding in Alberta, or is a neutral factor. The law applicable to several of the contracts at issue is the law of Alberta, where all but one of the parties to this Action carry on business and where many of the physical records regarding this claim are located.</P>
<P>11. Efficiency and fairness also favour proceeding in Alberta. All of the principal actors involved in the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project are parties to this Action, and the most reasonable means to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings is to allow this Action to proceed in the usual course. Further, given the number of individuals the parties have already identified as likely to be required for Questioning, Alberta's more robust Rules regarding Questioning are better suited to allowing the complex facts underlying this claim to be brought to light, which will assist in the assessment and potential resolution of the claims. To the extent that Saskatchewan's much more limited procedural Rules regarding questioning are touted as an advantage in favour of Saskatchewan, a consistent assessment of this factor demonstrates that it weighs in favour of Alberta or, at worst, remains neutral. Also, the learned Master's experience with litigation and the utility of oral examinations cannot be a determinative or guiding factor.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>12. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project was underway from 2012 to 2017. To facilitate construction, CP contracted with the Defendants, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) to provide engineering and construction services.</P>
<P>13. As a result of the failures on the part of Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL and Altus (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork embankment adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River collapsed (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks.</P>
<P>14. On December 1, 2017, CP initiated the within Action to recover the damages it suffered as a result of the Embankment Failure. CP's Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Defendant Contractors is liable to CP for breach of contract and in negligence. The Statement of Claim also alleges negligent misrepresentation as against Clifton and advances a breach of contract claim against Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), which issued a performance bond in respect of KPCL's work.</P>
<P>15. CP is a federal corporation with its registered office and headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. With few exceptions, the majority of the CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;Panteluk Affidavit&rdquo;), paras 18 and 78, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(i), pages A7 and A19<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project. CP's allegations as against Hatch in respect of the deficiencies in Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project sound in both contract and tort.</P>
<P>17. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton sworn March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 8 and Exhibit A, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(iv), Record of Proceedings at pages A545 and A549.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Effective January 1, 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Hatch contracted to provide professional engineering services as required by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10 and Exhibit B, Record of Proceedings at pages A545 and A552<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. Although Hatch initially sought to have its work on the Belle Plaine Project formalized through a distinct contract between itself and CP, it subsequently <UNDER>requested</UNDER> that its work on the Belle Plaine Project be brought within the existing Hatch Contract. CP's acceptance of the Hatch proposal was expressly subject to Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project being undertaken pursuant to the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibits F, G and H, Record of Proceedings at pages A648, A650 and A652.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Hatch carries on business in Alberta, with offices in both Calgary and Edmonton,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 12 to the Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;McArdle Affidavit&rdquo;)&rdquo;), Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(vi), page A781.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and conducted the initial design work for the Belle Plaine Project (which is impugned in the claim) at its office in Calgary, Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16, Record of Proceedings at page A546.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This was in keeping with the proposal Hatch provided for the work on the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;), which identified 11 individuals as the personnel who would be working on the design and engineering of the Belle Plaine Project, all but two of whom were in Alberta (with none in Saskatchewan).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, para 6 and Schedule A at pages 20&ndash;32, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A784 and A808&ndash;A820.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. The Hatch Contract reflects the express agreement between Hatch and CP as to the law that would govern and the forum in which disputes would be determined, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch dated January 1, 2012 (&ldquo;Hatch Contract&rdquo;), section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A553<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. The vast majority of the Hatch employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project, including the Project Managers, Directors and Engineers, were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A781&ndash;A783.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A781&ndash;A783.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hatch's Project Manager for the Belle Plaine Project was based in Calgary throughout the period while Hatch was performing the work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, including at the time of the Embankment Failure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 5, Record of Proceedings at page A545; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A781&ndash;A783.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. As set out in the Hatch Proposal, although Hatch was to be the &ldquo;prime consultant&rdquo; and would rely on its &ldquo;strong, multi-discipline Calgary-based team&rdquo;, Hatch also proposed retaining its &ldquo;exclusive subconsultants&rdquo;, including Thurber, to assist with work on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit at para 6 and Schedule A at page 33, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A783 and A821.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its contractual obligations to CP under the Hatch Contract, Hatch was required to ensure that any subcontractors strictly adhered to all of the terms of the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 6 of Schedule A, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A554.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. Thurber, which is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit 24, Record of Proceedings at pages A15 and A263.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was retained by Hatch pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd., filed April 5, 2018 at para 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice to Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Thurber Engineering Ltd. are attached as Appendix A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Subcontract Agreement was made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See below at para 121.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Thurber carries on business in Alberta and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP/Thurber Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Thurber Corporation dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit Record of Proceedings at pages A897 - A898.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A898.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. On April 5, 2018, Thurber filed a Statement of Defence and a Notice of Claim against Co-defendants in this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd. and Notice to Co-defendants filed April 5, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Through its Notice to Co-defendants, Thurber is seeking contribution and indemnity from each of the other defendants in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact. Thurber intends to defend the claim in Alberta and is not seeking a move to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>26. Clifton was also involved in providing geotechnical and environmental engineering services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 11, Record of Proceedings at Tab (1)(iii), pageA303.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Clifton provided construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11, Record of Proceedings at page A303.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. Clifton is a federal corporation which maintains its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan and has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 2 and 4, Record of Proceedings at pages A300 - A301.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Supply of Services Retainer into which CP and Clifton had entered effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Retainer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 6 and Exhibit B, Record of Proceedings at pages A302 and A310.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Correspondence between CP and Clifton in respect of the Clifton Retainer was exchanged between their respective offices in Calgary and Regina. After having been executed on behalf of Clifton, the Clifton Retainer was executed and accepted by CP in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 8, Record of Proceedings at page A303.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. The Clifton Retainer specifically prescribes the applicable law <UNDER>and jurisdiction</UNDER>:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A318.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. Later, on April 8, 2015, CP and Clifton entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) under which Clifton was to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11, Record of Proceedings at page A303; Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Clifton dated April 8, 2016 (&ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A361<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. Like the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract reflects the express agreement between CP and Clifton specifically prescribing the law applicable to the Clifton Contract <UNDER>and the forum</UNDER> in which disputes would be adjudicated, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the <UNDER>exclusive</UNDER> jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A370.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>33. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project involved a significant earthworks component, in respect of which CP contracted with KPCL.</P>
<P>34. KPCL provided both construction and earthmoving services and was the main construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 5, 7 and 39, Record of Proceedings at pages A4 and A10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's contractual responsibilities pursuant to the contract in place between it and CP included the construction of the Qu-Appelle River crossing and adjacent embankments,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 39, Record of Proceedings at page A10-A11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> one of which is the subject matter of this Action.</P>
<P>35. Throughout the course of its work on the Belle Plaine Project and, indeed, until approximately one month after KPCL was served with the Statement of Claim in this Action, KPCL was registered in Alberta as an extra-provincial corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; First Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of KPCL dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 6, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Altus, which is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta and maintains its head office within Alberta, provided survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project under an agreement between CP and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, paras 3 and 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice of Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership May 2, 2018 are attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. On April 27, 2018, Altus filed a Statement of Defence to this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Like Thurber, Altus has filed a Notice to Co-defendants through which it is seeking contribution and indemnity from the other Defendant Contractors in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, and Thurber. Altus intends to defend this matter in Alberta</P>
<P>38. The Belle Plaine Project was constructed using the &ldquo;observational&rdquo; method, an engineering approach that involves continuous monitoring and review of the progress of the project, and implements modifications to the design and construction approach on an ongoing basis.</P>
<P>39. Based on that ongoing monitoring, Clifton, Altus and KPCL were all intimately involved in the implementation of the observational method during the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>40. Altus' involvement was critical and included placing the monitoring equipment used and implementing instructions as to available construction areas as determined by Clifton by staking the construction area to demarcate zones where KPCL could and could not continue with construction at any given time. It was critical that the flagged stakes be placed exactly where required so that earth was not placed on or in areas with high water readings, which could cause a failure.</P>
<P>41. Clifton, for its part, analyzed the information received from the monitoring equipment placed by Altus and refined the design for the Belle Plaine Project on an ongoing basis based on its analysis of that information. Based on that analysis, Clifton then provided direction to KPCL through Altus as to which areas in the Belle Plaine Project construction area were available for continued work by KPCL.</P>
<P>42. Intact is the only defendant to this Action not directly involved in the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project. The Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL required KPCL to provide CP with a performance bond through a duly licensed surety company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL dated March 12, 2015 (&ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;), section GC35, Exhibit 8 to the Panteluk Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Intact was selected as that company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 30, Record of Proceedings at page A9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Intact, a federally regulated company,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A938.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carries on business and maintains offices in Alberta and is licensed to provide insurance in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories dated June 12 2018 (&ldquo;Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 1&ndash;3, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A711 - A712.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. On or about May 28, 2015, Intact issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX to KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP for the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Performance Bond issued by Intact to KPCL on May 28, 2015, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Percy Affidavit&rdquo;), Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(ii), Record of Proceedings at page A295.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Despite having guaranteed the performance of KPCL's obligations with respect to the Belle Plaine Project, which included construction of the embankment that failed, Intact has refused to act upon the bond to address KPCL's defaults. Intact's failure to honour its obligations under the performance bond left CP in the position of having to fund all of the work in connection with KPCL's failures without the benefit of the bond provided.</P>
<P>46. KPCL alleges that proceedings in Alberta will have a detrimental impact on KPCL's finances and its operations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g. Panteluk Affidavit, paras 85 and 89, Record of Proceedings at page A23 - A24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet has remarkably refused to provide any of its financial information,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 28, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to Second Notice to Admit Facts dated June 8, 2018, para 5, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A921 and A924.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the inference being that the financial information would not support the allegations. In a similar vein, Intact initially provided sworn evidence that this dispute is presently having an impact on the bonding support Intact is able to provide to KPCL,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit C, Record of Proceedings at pages A294 and A298.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet both KPCL and Intact have since confirmed that no such impact has been felt.</P>
<P>47. KPCL, for its part, concedes that it has not turned down any jobs, or declined to bid on any jobs, due to unavailability of bonding support or limitations on the scope of bonding available to it, whether through Intact or any other surety provider.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 11, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 5 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A693 - A693.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, Intact has confirmed that at no time between January 1, 2016 and April 2018 did it refuse any request for bonding from KPCL, nor has it reduced the amount of any bond issued to KPCL or otherwise limited the scope of bonding available to KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 4 and 6, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A712.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's allegations of financial impact remain entirely unsubstantiated.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. CP's Statement of Claim was filed on December 1, 2017 and was served soon after it was filed, as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was served in Estevan, Saskatchewan on January 10, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) Thurber was served in Victoria, British Columbia on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch was served in Mississauga, Ontario on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Intact was served in Calgary, Alberta on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(e) Altus was served in Edmonton, Alberta on January 11, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Clifton was served in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 19, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>49. On February 6, 2018, almost a full month after service of the Statement of Claim in this Action, counsel for KPCL sought confirmation that an extension would be granted in respect of KPCL's Statement of Defence and that CP would not take any steps against KPCL in the interim. It is surely not a coincidence that until February 6, 2018, KPCL was registered with Alberta Registries as an extra-provincial corporation in the province of Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule A, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, paras 6 and 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909/A911.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. Unbeknownst to CP, KPCL had previously filed a Statement of Claim against CP in Regina in Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 2177/2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;). Like the within Action, KPCL's Saskatchewan Action concerns the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>51. KPCL took no steps to serve the KPCL Saskatchewan Action when it was filed, but instead waited more than five months, including almost a full month <UNDER>after</UNDER> CP served the Statement of Claim in this Action upon KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 1, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 5, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Interestingly, it was not until February 7, 2018, after having secured CP's agreement to an extension in respect of its own Statement of Defence, that KPCL served CP with the KPCL Saskatchewan Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule B, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909/A912.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. Upon receipt of KPCL's Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, CP immediately advised KPCL that it considered jurisdiction to be an issue in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action. Indeed, KPCL already knew that, as CP had initiated this Action in Alberta. On February 9, 2018, in the interests of efficiency and practicality, CP proposed that the jurisdictional issues in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action be addressed as part of KPCL's planned application in respect of jurisdiction before this Court, obviating the need for a duplicate application before the Saskatchewan Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule C, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909/A913.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and thereby minimizing the cost and time associated with trying to deal with similar motions in separate jurisdictions.</P>
<P>53. KPCL refused. Rather, KPCL insisted that it was unable to consider CP's proposal until CP had filed an application of its own challenging jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, presumably for strategic reasons. KPCL also refused CP's request for an extension of time in respect of CP's Statement of Defence in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule D, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A906 and A909/A915.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. Indeed, although KPCL filed its application challenging jurisdiction on February 8, 2018, it subsequently took the position that it was unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, Exhibits N-II, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only after forcing a court appearance to address scheduling were the Jurisdiction Applications set down for July 4 and 5, 2018.</P>
<P>55. Despite the existence of not only CP's claim in the within Action, but its own claim in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, both of which raise issues in respect of the obligations between CP and KPCL on the Belle Plaine Project and the performance of those obligations, on March 5, 2018 KPCL filed yet another claim against CP by way of Originating Application under Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 655/2018, this time seeking payment of holdback funds relating to the Belle Plaine Project (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 16 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A927.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. CP sought a stay of the need to challenge jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and KPCL's Originating Application (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Actions</BOLD>&rdquo;), pending the determination of the Jurisdiction Applications. CP's application was heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow in Regina on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit, paras 4 - 5, Record of Proceedings at page A928 - A929.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Chow was advised of KPCL's jurisdictional challenge before the Alberta Courts, and has since been advised of Master Prowse's decision and of the appeals that have been launched in respect of that decision.</P>
<P>57. CP has not yet filed an application challenging jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and, accordingly, such applications&mdash;should they become necessary&mdash;have not yet been set down, let alone heard. It follows that neither of the Saskatchewan Actions have yet been set down for hearing, and both could be added as counterclaims to the within action, if the court allows the within appeal.</P>
<P>58. On December 1, 2017, CP also filed a claim as against Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;) in QB Action No. 1701-16251 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh Action</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A copy of the Statement of Claim filed on behalf of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in QB Action No. 1701-16251 is attached as Appendix C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Marsh Action also concerns the Belle Plaine Project, but is specific to CP's allegations that breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of Marsh, which provided insurance brokerage services to CP, including in respect of insurance on the Belle Plaine Project, have resulted in damages to CP.</P>
<P>59. Marsh has undertaken to defend in the Marsh Action and will not be challenging jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>60. Rule 6.14(1) of the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> allows an applicant or a respondent to an application before a Master to appeal the judgment or order of the Master to a Judge.
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta. Reg. 124/2010, rule 6.14(1) [<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. An appeal from the decision of a Master is an appeal <EM>de novo</EM> and no deference should be given to the decision under appeal. Accordingly, the standard of review, on all issues, is correctness.

<P>62. This Court is, therefore, to consider afresh the question of jurisdiction and, specifically, the question of whether any portion of the within Action should be stayed because Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, which can be answered in the affirmative only if Saskatchewan is a <UNDER>clearly</UNDER> more appropriate forum for this litigation, not just another appropriate forum.</P>
<P>63. There are two distinct aspects to the substantive jurisdiction question at issue in this appeal: jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> and <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Haaretz</EM></BOLD>], para 27, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1>

<P>64. Jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is based upon the existence of a real and substantial connection between the forum and the subject matter of an action, as demonstrated by the presence of one or more presumptive connecting factors. To rebut a presumed real and substantial connection, the party challenging jurisdiction must establish that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the claim is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction.&rdquo; The factors upon which the party seeking to rebut a presumed real and substantial connection relies should not be those considered during the second stage of the analysis, as the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is, and must remain, distinct.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 4 at para 43, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at paras 56, 81, 92 and 97</P1></P>
<P>65. Once jurisdiction is established through the real and substantial connection test, the claim will proceed in that jurisdiction unless a party challenging jurisdiction is able to show that exceptional circumstances exist such that another jurisdiction is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; The bar is high&mdash;the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that:
<QUOTE><P>The use of the words &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo; should be interpreted as an acknowledgment that the normal state of affairs is that jurisdiction should be exercised once it is properly assumed. ... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation....</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 4 at para 46, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at para 109</P1></P>
<P>66. Assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is multi-factorial and requires a court to consider the overall fairness and efficiency of proceeding in one jurisdiction as opposed to another, as determined based on factors ranging from the law applicable to the dispute, to the location of physical evidence, to the comparative convenience and expense for the parties and likely witnesses.</P>
<P>67. In this instance, the presumptive connecting factors between this claim and Alberta ground the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> of the Alberta courts and there is no sound basis upon which the respondents may rebut this presumption.</P>
<P>68. Further, the respondents cannot demonstrate that this matter invokes the exceptional circumstances that justify a determination that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum in which to have this Action heard.</P></BLOCK3>

<P>69. At common law, a court's jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over a defendant is automatic where that defendant is served within the jurisdiction of the court.

<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> by Consent</UNDER></TI>
<P>71. In this instance, four of the six defendants (Thurber, Altus, Clifton and Hatch) have expressly consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. That fact, in itself, is sufficient to resolve the question of whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, to the extent that any such question truly arose, as the necessary real and substantial connection is between the forum and the action, <UNDER>not</UNDER> between the forum and any specific party.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER>Governing Principles</UNDER></TI>
<P>72. Parties are always at liberty to consent to a Court's jurisdiction. As confirmed by this Honourable Court, consent:
<QUOTE><P>permits jurisdiction over an extra-provincial defendant who consents, whether by voluntary submission, <EM>attornment by appearance and defence</EM>, <UNDER>or prior agreement</UNDER> to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the domestic court.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Limited v Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 ABQB 442</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Norex</EM></BOLD>], para 49, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt et al v Carcelles et al</SOC><CITE>2002 OJ No 2128</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 19 [italicized emphasis in original, underline emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 7</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. If a party attorns, including attorning by defending on the merits, or consents contractually to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the matter.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc v Research In Motion Ltd</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE><PARANUM>35 and 37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Meta4Hand</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 8</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 6 at para 31</P1></P>
<P>74. It is open to parties to enter into commercial agreements regarding the forum in which disputes between them are to be adjudicated, and it is &ldquo;essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding contracting parties to [such] agreements.&rdquo; Where there is a valid agreement that includes an agreement as to jurisdiction, consideration of whether there is a real and substantial connection to the forum is redundant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>ZI Pompey</EM></BOLD>], paras 20 and 21, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 9</BOLD></P1>

<P>75. Forum selection clauses are a distinct element in consideration of jurisdiction, and should not be subsumed within the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis though are also a factor to consider in that analysis. Further, forum selection clauses should be enforced unless there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to do so. In this respect, the burden is on the party challenging jurisdiction to &ldquo;show sufficiently strong reasons to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just in the circumstances to require the [challenging party] to adhere to the terms of the clause.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>ZI Pompey</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 9 at paras 20, 21 and 39</P1></P>
<P>76. Inconvenience does not amount to strong cause. It is, for example, not open to parties who have entered into a contractual agreement with respect to forum to complain later that the evidence and witnesses may not be within that jurisdiction. Such facts either were or ought to have been known prior to entering into the agreement containing the forum selection provision and, to the extent that posed a concern, the appropriate time to raise the issue is at the time of contract negotiation. Allowing the location of witnesses and evidence to be raised after the fact would undermine commercially negotiated agreements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Atlantic Cement Carriers Ltd v Atlantic Towing Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 761</CITE><PARANUM>18 and 24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>77. In terms of their substance, forum selection clauses fall along a spectrum, from contracts which contain no such provisions to those which contain exclusive jurisdiction provisions under which the parties choose a single forum for the adjudication of disputes.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v Megawheels Technologies Inc</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 4493</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Megawheels</EM></BOLD>], para 19, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>78. While even an exclusive attornment provision does not oust the jurisdiction of a local court, courts give significant weight to exclusive attornment provisions and should not interfere with the parties' selection of forum attornment provisions &ldquo;unless it is shown that the matter cannot be properly dealt with in the foreign court.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 12 at para 20</P1></P>
<P>79. Non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions also carry significant weight. In <CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp. v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Virtue described such clauses as &ldquo;important consideration[s]&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; in the context of a forum selection clause means that the parties have attorned to that jurisdiction &ldquo;except in matters where some extraordinary condition or reason would require that the matter be determined elsewhere.&rdquo; Once a suit arises in the selected jurisdiction, the parties will be required to attorn.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>136 AR 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 28, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 13</BOLD></P1>

<P>80. Unsurprisingly, the operation of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is more limited in scope than that of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Essentially, under a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, &ldquo;either party may sue the other wherever it has the right to do so&rdquo;, but once one party initiates a suit in the named jurisdiction, the other party must keep its bargain by attorning to that jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 12 at para 28</P1></P>
<P>81. While a forum selection clause must be applicable to the dispute in question to be given effect, it is inappropriate to parse the wordings of forum selection clauses too closely to determine whether they apply to the claims as pleaded, as this can foster &ldquo;dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution.&rdquo; Courts interpret jurisdiction clauses broadly, and have rejected an approach in which fine distinctions are drawn based upon the language used.
<P1>Rafferty and Pitel, <EM>Conflict of Laws</EM>, 2nd ed (Irwin law: Toronto, 2010) at 131-132, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 15</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 10 at 11-12</P1></P>
<P>82. Where a claim of negligence has arisen in a contractual relationship based upon an agreement which contains a forum selection clause, the forum selection is equally applicable to a claim in tort unless the clause clearly does <UNDER>not</UNDER> cover the dispute.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 10 at 11-12 - 11-13</P1></P>
<P>83. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered a claim in which the plaintiff had entered into two contracts with the defendants, one of which contained a forum selection clause through which the parties agreed that &ldquo;any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this Agreement&rdquo; was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and the other of which contained no forum selection clause. The plaintiff sued in Ontario for negligent misrepresentation based upon the second contract. The defendants successfully sought a stay based upon the forum selection provision in the other contract, with the Court concluding that the claims in negligence were intertwined with the contract, making it inevitable that the contract would be before the court as part of the factual narrative and through the reliance of the defendants upon the contract in their defences, such that there was no basis not to enforce the forum selection provision.

<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>84. Thurber and Altus, having filed Statements of Defence that address the substance of the claims against them, have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The claims against them arising from the Belle Plaine Project will proceed in Alberta. As well, the notices for contribution and indemnity issued by Thurber and Altus against the other defendants will also, presumably, proceed.</P>
<P>85. As Master Prowse correctly concluded, Hatch and Clifton have also attorned, through their respective contracts with CP, to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at paragraphs 12&ndash;14, Record of Proceedings at page A1075.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. The validity of the Clifton Retainer, Clifton Contract and Hatch Contract is unchallenged, and there is no suggestion that this matter cannot properly be dealt with by the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>87. Clifton and CP attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract. Under the Clifton Retainer, CP and Clifton &ldquo;attorn[ed] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A318.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Contract, for its part, stipulates that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A370.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reflecting Clifton's attornment to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>88. Both Hatch and CP attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Hatch Contract, which states that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A561.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>89. The attornment provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract contain no limitation as to subject matter scope. Certainly, they contain nothing that would suggest that they &ldquo;clearly [do] not&rdquo; cover claims in either breach of contract or tort, and it would be absurd to suggest that these provisions do not apply to breaches of the very contracts in which they appear. As Master Prowse correctly concluded, Clifton and Hatch attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, which attornment cannot help but include attornment for the purpose of litigation arising from alleged breach of the contracts in which the attornment provisions are contained.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at paragraph 14, Record of Proceedings at page A1075.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>90. This conclusion is consistent not only with the wording of the attornment provisions, but with the Contracts as a whole. In each of these Contracts, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is long and detailed, expressly including not just the portion containing the terms in which the forum selection provisions are set out, but associated schedules providing descriptions of services, minimum requirements for personnel, security requirements, and other details regarding the work to be performed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, page 1, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A552; Clifton Retainer, page 1, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A311; Clifton Contract, page 1, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A361.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More importantly, through the Hatch Contract, the Clifton Contract and the Clifton Retainer, Clifton and Hatch expressly agreed to provide services, meaning their engineering and design work in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; bringing not only contractual interpretation but the performance of the contract squarely within <UNDER>all</UNDER> of the terms of the Agreements, including the forum selection provision.</P>
<P>91. The proper interpretation of a forum selection clause was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the contractual duty of good faith, and alternatively for breach of agency duty and wrongful dismissal. The defendant applied for a stay of the action in British Columbia based upon the forum selection provision in the contract between the parties, which read:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Saskatchewan in respect of its interpretation or breach.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1700</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>92. The claim launched was almost wholly unrelated to either the interpretation or breach of the contract that contained the jurisdiction clause, with the Court noting that it was not a case in which the parties &ldquo;had a difference of opinion over the interpretation of the contract or alleged the other to be in breach of it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 17 at para 53</P1></P>
<P>93. That is in sharp contrast to the present situation.</P>
<P>94. Here, there is no limitation upon the scope of the attornment provisions. Before Master Prowse, Clifton and Hatch suggested that the absence of wording confirming the application of the attornment provisions to contractual disputes somehow indicates that the provisions are limited to questions of contractual interpretation. Master Prowse correctly rejected this transparent effort to create ambiguity where none exists.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at paragraph 14, Record of Proceedings at page A1075.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>95. Clifton and Hatch have attorned (either exclusively or nonexclusively) to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;full stop. That attornment is, as suggested by the whole of each provision, in respect of the &ldquo;Agreements.&rdquo; CP's claims against both Hatch and Clifton expressly allege that those Defendants are in breach of their respective Agreements with CP, bringing the claims directly within the scope of the forum selection provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Contract and Clifton Retainer.</P>
<P>96. Indeed, the Clifton Contract contains an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, as there is no suggestion that this claim cannot be properly dealt with by the Alberta Courts, there is no reason to interfere with this contractual provision.</P>
<P>97. The Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer contain non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions. Given that CP filed the Statement of Claim in the within Action in Alberta&mdash;the selected forum&mdash;both Clifton and Hatch are contractually bound to the jurisdiction.</P>
<P>98. To the extent that this Honourable Court finds that the wording of the forum selection provision in the Clifton Contract allowing CP to begin proceedings in other jurisdictions affects the exclusivity of the provision in respect of Clifton (rather than CP alone, per the wording of the clause), the only result would be to transform the provision into one in which both parties had attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The provision would then operate in the same way as the provisions within the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer, meaning that Clifton would be required to attorn to CP's Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>99. In addition to the breach of contract claims set out in CP's Statement of Claim, claims of negligence have arisen within CP's contractual relationships with both Hatch and Clifton. CP's claims in contract and tort are intertwined, making this a situation in which the attornment provisions are applicable to both causes of action.</P>
<P>100. On the basis of the provisions in the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract and the Hatch Contract, Master Prowse correctly concluded that the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> over Hatch and Clifton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at paragraph 14, Record of Proceedings at page A1075.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no reason, let alone strong cause, to oust this jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Via Real and Substantial Connection</UNDER></TI>
<P>101. A court has jurisdiction over an action if there is a real and substantial connection between <UNDER>the action</UNDER> and the court's territory. The assumption of jurisdiction is justified under the real and substantial connection test where objective factors, as identified by the courts, connect the plaintiff's claim to the chosen forum. It is not necessary to show the strongest real and substantial connection, only that such a connection exists.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Editions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc. v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 4</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 18</BOLD></P1>

<P>102. Further, a real and substantial connection between one alleged cause of action and the jurisdiction is sufficient to ground a Court's jurisdiction over the whole. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, Justice LeBel was explicit on this point, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>it is possible for a case to sound both in contract and in tort or to invoke more than one tort. Would a court be limited to hearing the specific part of the case that can be directly connected with the jurisdiction? Such a rule would breach the principles of fairness and efficiency on which the assumption of jurisdiction is based. The purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation and the defendant. If such a connection exists in respect of a factual and legal situation, the court must assume jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. The plaintiff should not be obliged to litigate a tort claim in Manitoba and a related claim for restitution in Nova Scotia. That would be incompatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at para 99</P1></P>
<P>103. The following factors were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection:
<P1>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P1>
<P1>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P1>
<P1>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P1>
<P1>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at para 90</P1></P>
<P>104. Where one of the factors giving rise to a real and substantial connection is present, the defendant bears the burden of rebutting the presumed connection. Rebutting the presumption, however, requires the party challenging jurisdiction to show that the connection is so weak that it would not be reasonable for that party to expect to be called to answer proceedings in the forum with which the real and substantial connection exists.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at paras 95 and 97</P1></P>
<P>105. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada also recognized that, where there is a real and substantial connection for the purpose of satisfying the applicable rule for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection may be presumed to exist. While procedural directives such as the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> do not <UNDER>establish</UNDER> jurisdiction, they &ldquo;represent an expression of wisdom and experience drawn from the life of the law&rdquo; and &ldquo;are based on objective facts that may also indicate when courts can properly assume jurisdiction.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at paras 43 and 83</P1></P>
<P>106. In Alberta, the factors to be considered in assessing whether service <EM>ex juris</EM> is appropriate are set out in Rule 11.25(3), which states in part that:
<QUOTE><P>... in the following circumstances <UNDER>a real and substantial connection is presumed to exist</UNDER>: ...
<QUOTE><PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the claim relates to a contract or alleged contract made, performed or breached in Alberta;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>the claim is governed by the law of Alberta;...</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(d)</N><PARAP>the claim relates to a tort committed in Alberta;...</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(g)</N><PARAP>the defendant is resident in Alberta;...</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(i)</N><PARAP>the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta ...</PARAP></PARA></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 1 at rule 11.25(3) [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>The relationship between Rule 11.25 and jurisdiction was considered at length by Justice Wakeling (as he then was) in <CASEREF><SOC>Greenbuilt Group of Companies Ltd. v RMD Engineering Inc.</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Greenbuilt</EM>&rdquo;). After an extensive historical analysis, Justice Wakeling affirmed the general principle that procedural rules governing service <EM>ex juris</EM> do not normally establish jurisdiction &ldquo;[u]nless the service <EM>ex juris</EM> rule adopts the constitutional test for a court exercising jurisdiction&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 6 at para 68</P1></P>
<P>107. Justice Wakeling went on to confirm that Rule 11.25 expressly incorporates
<QUOTE><P>the real and substantial connection concept ... accorded constitutional status, with the service <EM>ex juris</EM> norm. As a result, a determination under the new rules that a party has passed the service <EM>ex juris</EM> which means that <UNDER>the Court has the constitutional jurisdiction</UNDER> to hear the case.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 6 at para 91 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>108. Unlike the situation in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, where the service <EM>ex juris</EM> rules did not establish jurisdiction though they allowed service on necessary and proper parties, the situation is different in Alberta. In Alberta, being a necessary or proper party to an action is presumed to constitute a real and substantial connection.</P>
<P>109. The analysis of jurisdiction simpliciter set out in <EM>Van Breda</EM> and explained in <EM>Greenbuilt</EM> has subsequently been applied by this Court on more than one occasion. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court concluded that for the purpose of service, the &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; connecting factor is a presumptive connecting factor where the subject matter of the action is connected to Alberta and other principal players in the dispute are Alberta corporations. This only makes sense, otherwise different claims, involving different parties would need to be litigated in different jurisdictions even though they arise from a common set of facts. That could not, to use Justice Lebel's words, be compatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Arcis</BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>110. In <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc. v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Farrington relied upon <EM>Arcis</EM> as demonstrating that &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; remains a presumptive connecting factor, grounding a finding that the Court had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in part on the necessary and proper party connection.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 402</CITE><PARANUM>26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Jebco</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 21</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>111. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court affirmed that the factors set out in Rule 11. 25(3), including whether a defendant is a proper and necessary party, constitute presumptive real and substantial connections for the purpose of a jurisdictional analysis.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 36</CITE><PARANUM>54 and 59</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>112. Accordingly, factors establishing a presumptive real and substantial connection with the courts of Alberta include:
<P1>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province; (b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P1>
<P1>(c) a contract connected with the dispute was made, performed or breached in the province;</P1>
<P1>(d) the tort was committed in the province;</P1>
<P1>(e) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta.</P1></P>
<P>113. In addition, while the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not a <EM>prima facie</EM> connecting factor, in <EM>Van Breda</EM> the Court suggested that the plaintiff's location is nonetheless relevant, stating that the:
<QUOTE><P>... presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not, <UNDER>on its own</UNDER>, a sufficient connecting factor. ... <UNDER>Absent other considerations</UNDER>, the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction will not create a presumptive relationship between the forum and either the subject matter of the litigation or the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5, at para 86 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>114. In this case, while CP's presence in Alberta does not, on its own, establish the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, the fact that CP is resident and carries on business in Alberta is a further factor in favour of maintaining Alberta jurisdiction.</P>

<P>116. Carrying on business within a jurisdiction does not require that a corporation be registered there, but does require an actual presence, such as maintaining an office or visiting regularly.

<P>118. The fact that five of the six defendants carry on business in Alberta is another presumptive real and substantial connection grounding this Court's jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Contracts Made and Performed in Alberta</UNDER></TI>
<P>119. CP's Statement of Claim is also connected to contracts made in Alberta.</P>
<P>120. Thurber was retained by Hatch to provide geotechnical services for the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 4; Subcontract Agreement between Hatch and Thurber dated November 27, 2012 (&ldquo;Thurber Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A719<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber Contract was made between two parties who have identified themselves as within Alberta,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, preamble at page 1, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A719.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and was signed by individuals confirmed to have been in Alberta during the course of the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A898, A902 and A781&ndash;783.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Correspondence from Thurber to Hatch in which the contract was negotiated was sent from Thurber's office in Calgary to Hatch's office in Edmonton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, Exhibit B, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A719<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>121. In its Statement of Claim, CP raises allegations in respect of the Thurber Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 71&ndash;76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its defence, Thurber, in turn, relies upon the allegation that it met all of its obligations under the Thurber Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>122. The Clifton Contract was also made in Alberta. The Clifton Contract was executed by Wayne Clifton on April 16, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton sworn June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Second Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;) at para 3, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(v), page A658 - A659.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It was then sent to CP&mdash;in Alberta&mdash;where it was executed on behalf of CP on April 30, 2015, formally concluding the Clifton Contract, which had been made when (and where) CP received Clifton's communications of acceptances.</P>
<P>123. The Thurber Contract and the Clifton Contract were made in Alberta and are connected to the subject matter of this dispute. A contract need not be one to which the plaintiff in a proceeding is a party to be a contract &ldquo;connected&rdquo; with the Action and, accordingly, this amounts to another presumptive real and substantial connection between Alberta and the whole of this Action.
<P1><EM>Lapointe</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 19 at para 44</P1></P>
<P>124. Performance of a contract in Alberta is, equally, a presumptive real and substantial connection factor. Performance of a contract involves the fulfillment of an obligation or a promise under that contract.
<P1><EM>Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary</EM>, 7th ed., <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 23</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>125. In this case, both Hatch and Thurber had contractual obligations to perform engineering and geotechnical work on behalf of CP as part of the Belle Plaine Project. That work was carried out in Alberta.</P>
<P>126. Hatch employees involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A7781&ndash;A783.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the initial design work performed by Hatch was done within its office in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16, Record of Proceedings at page A546.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>127. Similarly, all of the Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit at paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A898 and A902.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>128. The work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, which was the driving purpose underlying the Hatch Contract, was performed in Alberta. Likewise, Thurber's work under the Thurber Contract, through which it provided engineering and geotechnical work for the Belle Plaine Project, occurred within Alberta. The performance of these contracts in Alberta constitutes a further real and substantial connection between Alberta and this Action.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Tort Committed in the Province</UNDER></TI>
<P>129. In addition to its claims in breach of contract and tort, CP alleges that Clifton is liable for negligent misrepresentations contained within the proposal Clifton submitted prior to the execution of the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 91<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>130. The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs where the representation is received or acted upon. It is, moreover, foreseeable that misrepresentations sent to a plaintiff's office in one jurisdiction would be received and relied upon by the plaintiff in another province. If the defendant foresees that its representations will be received or acted upon within a particular jurisdiction, it should expect to be called to account in proceedings in that jurisdiction. As explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal, &ldquo;[i]n the modem world where corporations have various offices in various locations, corporate defendants should not escape liability simply because they send [a misrepresentation] to an office of the plaintiff outside Ontario with the clear understanding that it will be acted on in Ontario.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>2249659 Ontario Ltd v Sparkasse Siegan</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 354</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 24</BOLD></P1>

<P>131. The CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were predominantly in Alberta as the Belle Plaine Project was being designed and constructed. Clifton cannot have expected anything other than that its proposal for the Belle Plaine Project, which contained the misrepresentations upon which CP relied, would be acted upon within Alberta, especially as Clifton had communicated with CP in Calgary in respect of the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 8 and 15, Record of Proceedings at pages A303 and A304; Second Clifton Affidavit, para 3, Record of Proceedings at page A658.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clifton met with CP in Calgary to discuss its work prior to providing the proposal containing the misrepresentations<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 9 and 12, Record of Proceedings at page A303.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and agreed to provide all applicable notices under the Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract to CP in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 24 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A318 and A323; Clifton Contract, section 25 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A370 and AA373.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>Claim Relates to Contracts Governed by Alberta Law</UNDER></TI>
<P>132. The applicability of Alberta law is a further factor establishing the real and substantial connection between this Action and Alberta that grounds the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 1, rule 11.25(3)</P1></P>
<P>133. The Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract, and the Hatch Contract are all governed by the law of Alberta, pursuant to the following stipulation:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A561; Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A318; Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page A370.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>134. The role of Alberta law in these agreements is a further factor giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection between Alberta and this claim. Unlike the situation in <EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, in which Justice Wakeling came to the conclusion that the claim was &ldquo;probably governed by Alberta law&rdquo;, here there is no doubt that Alberta law applies to the Clifton and Hatch Contracts. Here, the Governing Law provisions manifest the express intention of the parties to have Alberta law apply to the interpretation of the Contracts, which will be a key issue in this Action. As in <EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, this factor should be taken as weighing heavily in favour of maintaining the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, even where a contract was made in another jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Greenbuilt</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 6 at paras 108 and 113</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Necessary and Proper Parties to the Alberta Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>135. The test for determining whether an extra-territorial defendant is a necessary and proper party to a claim so as to confer jurisdiction turns on whether:
<QUOTE><P>supposing both parties had been within the jurisdiction would they both have been proper parties to the action? If they would, and only one of them is in this country, then the rule says that the other may be served, just as if he had been within the jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>136. The &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; factor is a presumptive connecting factor for the purposes of determining jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. Rule 11.25 of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> expressly incorporates the concept of real and substantial connection within the test governing service <EM>ex juris</EM>, and includes necessary and proper party as a presumptive factor establishing a basis for service <EM>ex juris</EM>. Accordingly, where a party is a necessary and proper party for the purpose of grounding servicing <EM>ex juris</EM>, this also services as a sound basis for jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.

<P1><EM>Turner</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 22 at paras 54 and 59</P1></P>
<P>137. Altus is an Alberta corporation and was served in Alberta. Intact, registered in Alberta, was also served in Alberta. The only question under this factor in the analysis is whether the other defendants, had they been in Alberta, would have been proper parties to the claim.</P>
<P>138. The answer to this question in respect of each of the other defendants is, resoundingly, yes.</P>
<P>139. During the original application before Master Prowse, Clifton conceded that it is a necessary and proper party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Brief of Law on Behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd. filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Brief&rdquo;), para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, each of the briefs filed on behalf of the Respondents for the original Jurisdiction Applications appeared to contemplate that if the claim were to proceed in Saskatchewan, all of the parties presently involved would continue as parties in that forum,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief, para 65; Brief of Law of KPCL filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Brief&rdquo;), para 102; Brief of Law of Hatch filed June 15, 2018, para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> suggesting that each of them is a necessary party to the litigation wherever it takes place.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>140. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is distinct from, and irrelevant to, the question of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 4 at paras 27-28 <EM>Van</EM></P1>
<P1><EM>Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at para 101</P1></P>
<P>141. Where a Court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a real and substantial connection, it retains a residual discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that it is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and that another forum is clearly preferable. The onus is on the party seeking a stay on this basis to show that an alternate forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, based not upon the preferences of the parties as KPCL suggests,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 133&ndash;136.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but upon the requirements of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 5 at paras 105 and 108</P1></P>
<P>142. A proper <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis does not dissect the claims in an effort to separate constituent causes of action or claims against individual parties that might, in the absence of the larger proceeding, be outside the jurisdiction of the court in which an action has been filed. Rather, where multiple claims are brought within one proceeding, the action is to be considered as a whole to assess whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, supra Tab 10 at 13&ndash;23</P1></P>
<P>143. While Master Prowse initially correctly identified the test through which forum <EM>non conveniens</EM> is assessed as being whether there is another forum that is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at paragraph 52, Record of Proceedings at page A1081.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> he subsequently went on to modify the test he applied to the circumstances of this case, falling into error in the process.</P>
<P>144. The test applied by Master Prowse expressly considered not whether Saskatchewan is a &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo; forum, but instead, was based upon his view that in this case his role in assessing <EM>forum conveniens</EM> was to &ldquo;simply determine which forum is <UNDER>likely more suitable</UNDER>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at para 57, Record of Proceedings at page A1082, emphasis added.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That was an error. It is not the test.</P>
<P>145. Additionally, Master Prowse then erred in his application of the test for determining whether Saskatchewan is the clearly more appropriate forum by failing to consider the effect of the attornment of Thurber and Altus to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts and, more importantly, the impact of the attornment provisions in the Hatch and Clifton Contracts on the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis.</P>
<P>146. As with jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing a challenge to jurisdiction based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court identified the following as potentially relevant, depending on the context:
<P1>(a) the locations of parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>

<P>148. Accordingly, the following <EM>CJPTA</EM> factors may also be relevant when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:

<P1>(c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings;</P1>

<P>151. As this reveals, of 48 likely witnesses CP has identified to date, 18 (or 33%) are in Saskatchewan, 16 (or 30%) are in Alberta, and the remainder (14 or 29%) are either outside both jurisdictions or in unknown locations. Therefore, 59% of the likely witnesses are outside Saskatchewan. That can hardly be &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; more favourable to Saskatchewan. This factor is, accordingly, essentially neutral. As in <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Company v SSAB Alabama Inc., SSAB U.S. Holdings Inc., and SSAB Americas, LLC</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF>&rdquo;) this is a situation where convenience for the parties as judged &ldquo;by the numbers&rdquo; weighs equally.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Company v SSAB Alabama Inc., SSAB U.S. Holdings Inc., and SSAB Americas, LLC</SOC><CITE>2018 SKQB 272</CITE></CASEREF> [<CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF>] at paras 68 and 69, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 30</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>152. That said, as in <CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF>, little or no weight should be given to the simple count of witnesses, especially where, as here, the litigation is in its infancy. As a result, this factor should be disregarded or treated as neutral.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF> <EM>supra</EM> Tab 30 at para 69</P1></P>
<P>153. Regardless of the jurisdiction in which this Action is heard, it will undoubtedly be inconvenient for some witnesses to travel from one jurisdiction to another for questioning and, eventually, trial. Moreover, there will be expenses associated with that process. CP remains prepared to assist in minimizing both the cost and inconvenience in a cooperative fashion with all parties with the suggestion of attending upon witnesses in their own jurisdictions for questioning, as may be reasonable.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>154. The parties to this claim are located in Alberta (CP and Altus), Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton), British Columbia (Thurber) and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact has, for the purpose of this application, filed an Affidavit from an individual in Alberta, but is a federally regulated corporation. See Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A938<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>155. It would be inconvenient for Clifton and KPCL to have this claim proceed in Alberta, and it would be equally inconvenient for CP and Altus to litigate in Saskatchewan, rendering this a neutral factor. Indeed, both Altus and Thurber have indicated they intend to defend and litigate in Alberta (and have filed defences and Notices to Co-Defendants accordingly).</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Records</UNDER></TI>
<P>156. In terms of the available evidence, it is only to be expected that many of the records regarding the Belle Plaine Project will be electronically accessible from virtually any jurisdiction, including Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 30, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 5 - 6, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at page 670.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>157. That said, physical records also exist regarding the parties' work on the Belle Plaine Project. While some of the defendants have their physical records for the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan, Hatch, which provided the primary engineering services for the design of the Belle Plaine Project, has physical records mostly located in Alberta, with <UNDER>none</UNDER> in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 3 - 4, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit, Record of Proceedings at pages A670.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>158. Hatch, Intact, Clifton and KPCL may continue to suggest the possibility of a site visit weighs in favour of treating Saskatchewan as the clearly more appropriate forum. That suggestion should be rejected here, as it was in <CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the court expressly rejected the suggestion that Alabama was to be favored because the court would be able to &ldquo;take a view&rdquo; of the site in question. Here, as there, no:
<QUOTE><P>particular evidence is offered as to what purpose would be served if the trier(s) of fact did an onsite view, nor is there evidence that an onsite view would accomplish anything that could not be achieved by the production of a video recording.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CN v SSAB</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 30 at para 74</P1></P>
<P>159. Regardless of where this Action proceeds, witnesses and parties will be inconvenienced. Expenses will be incurred. There is no basis upon which to assume that travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta is more expensive or inconvenient than travel in the other direction, and the parties, witnesses and records are balanced as between Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Cost of Transfer</UNDER></TI>
<P>160. At this stage, there would be little cost associated with a transfer of either the Saskatchewan Actions to Alberta or with transferring this Action to Saskatchewan, recognizing that two defendants have already defended the Alberta action and they have issues with being somehow forced into Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>Comparative Convenience/Expense</UNDER></TI>
<P>161. The comparative convenience of proceeding in Alberta as opposed to Saskatchewan cannot be considered without reference to the forum selection clauses that apply to Hatch and Clifton, as outlined above. As explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd. v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>it must be the rare case where [balance of convenience and expense] alone is so overwhelming as to be determinative if all other considerations are largely neutral or would dictate that the parties' agreement be upheld. That must be particularly so when, as here, the choice is between two common law jurisdictions in this country. <UNDER>A party who resides or carries on business in British Columbia but who agrees to litigate disputes in the courts of another province must be taken to have accepted at the time the agreement was made that there could be a significant measure of inconvenience and expense associated with geographical distances. That party should not then, without more, be easily relieved of the contractual obligation it agreed to bear</UNDER>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1996] BCJ No. 2148</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> [emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 31</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>162. The requirement that the attornment by contract of parties to litigation must be considered in assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is conspicuously absent from Master Prowse's decision on this point (though argued), and in itself is sufficient to render his conclusion erroneous.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction decision paragraphs 49&ndash;75, Record of Proceedings at pages A1081&ndash;A1084.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>163. If only the locations of the likely witnesses, the parties and the records regarding this claim were taken into account, the assessment of comparative convenience weighs slightly in favour of Alberta. However, once the jurisdiction clauses are also considered, as they must be, it is clear that neither Hatch nor Clifton ought to be relieved of any additional inconvenience or expense associated with the contractual agreements they accepted. It hardly lies in their mouths now to disclaim the very contractual commitment made for what they now assert would be more convenient or strategically preferable. As a result, on the whole, this factor weighs strongly in favour of Alberta's jurisdiction over this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Law to be Applied</UNDER></TI>
<P>164. The law to be applied to the claims in breach of contract as against Hatch and Clifton is unquestionably the law of Alberta, which is also applicable to the claim of negligent misrepresentation against Clifton and claims in relation to the Thurber Contract. There is, moreover, no reason that if an Alberta court was required to apply Saskatchewan law it could not do so, even in respect of claims requiring interpretation of Saskatchewan legislation such as <EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, which CP says has no application in any event in the within matters.

<P>165. While the law of Saskatchewan may apply to some of CP's claims in tort depending on how the Court construes the place where the tort occurred, and potentially to CP's claims in contract as against KPCL and Intact, Alberta courts could apply that law without issue, which would be no different than the Saskatchewan courts being called upon to apply Alberta law in accordance with the choice of law provisions if this Action were to be transferred to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>166. In either event, the general law of contract and tort are essentially the same in both places, rendering this a neutral factor.

<P>167. This factor is neutral, as a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts would be recognized in the other jurisdiction.

<BLOCK4><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Avoiding Multiplicity of Legal Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>168. Rule 1.2(2) of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> highlights the importance of efficiency in Court proceedings, a goal that is even more important in view of the scarcity of judicial resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Generally, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is more efficient in terms of the proceedings themselves and in the use of judicial resources.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 1, rule 1.2(2)</P1></P>
<P>169. In this case, KPCL itself has, it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions by filing the Originating Application in the face of its own Saskatchewan Action, seeking through both claims further payments in respect of KPCL's work on the Belle Plaine Project and corresponding determinations of KPCL's alleged rights under the KPCL Contract, all of which are raised squarely in this Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>170. It is respectfully submitted that the motivations behind KPCL's second action are questionable and whether it was commenced in an effort to bootstrap the current jurisdiction motion. KPCL, if it was looking for efficiency or cost-effectiveness or to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, could equally have simply added its claim in respect of holdback funds under the KPCL Contract either to the KPCL Saskatchewan Action or, of course, to the present claim.</P>
<P>171. In addition to <UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity, the substance of the KPCL Originating Application is also questionable. No lien can arise in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, which constitutes a federal undertaking&mdash;a railway.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Co v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 37</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>172. In the absence of a lien, KPCL is not a &ldquo;lien claimant&rdquo;, as defined within the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>, and so is not entitled to the remedies available to lien claimants thereunder. Moreover, it is not a trustee or the beneficiary of a trust within the meaning of the <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>. As a result, the remedies KPCL seeks in the KPCL Originating Application are simply unavailable to it, which again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action for such in Saskatchewan, given its jurisdictional challenge was, when the KPCL Originating Application was filed, already set for hearing in Alberta.
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 33 at ss 6(2), 17(1)(a), 38(6) and (7)</P1></P>
<P>173. In addition to having launched multiple actions regarding essentially the same subject matter, which in the usual course would amount to an abuse of process, KPCL has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications in different provinces, with its principal noting that he &ldquo;would like the Saskatchewan court to have the opportunity to address whether it will exercise jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, para 35, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> despite the fact that KPCL is in the process of having this Honourable Court consider the very same question.</P>
<P>174. Multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided. That is axiomatic. This basic principle, which reflects the inherent interest in efficiency, is embedded not only in the <EM>Rules</EM> but also in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2 (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). As confirmed in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, as a corollary to the principle that multiple proceedings regarding the same issues should be avoided, another of the Court's objectives is to ensure that all issues in controversy between the parties are determined as completely and finally as possible. This is the case in every province.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, ss 5(3)(f) and 8, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 38</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>175. In these circumstances, the twin objectives of avoiding multiple proceedings and allowing all issues to be determined as completely and finally as possible militates in favour of allowing this Action to proceed in Alberta, where all of the likely parties to the claim are already parties to the Action, four of the defendants have consented to the Court's jurisdiction, another is subject to presence-based jurisdiction and the one defendant (KPCL) in respect of which jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is not established directly, is not only a necessary and proper party to this Action but a respondent to Notice to Co-defendants issued against it. Indeed, the within Action will proceed in Alberta, so far as Altus and Thurber are concerned, and so what sense does it make to have the action, based on the same facts, also proceed in Saskatchewan? This must weigh heavily in favour of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Efficiency</UNDER></TI>
<P>176. CP wasted no time in proceeding with its claim in Alberta. KPCL, in contrast, waited 5 months to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, to which it now points as a parallel proceeding warranting transfer of the within Action to Saskatchewan, until CP's Action had been filed and served, and even then served the KPCL Saskatchewan Action only two days before KPCL's defence was due in this Action. KPCL then served a further proceeding against CP by way of Originating Application, which overlaps significantly with the issues in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and this claim.</P>
<P>177. Master Prowse appears to have given some weight to the fact that KPCL's Saskatchewan Action was filed first, referring to this fact at several points in his decision and citing it as a reason to modify the test applicable to assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at para 57, Record of Proceedings at page A1082.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It would not, however, be in the interest of fairness to allow a party who initiates a claim but does not serve it to rely on having been &ldquo;first to file&rdquo; to ground an argument with respect to forum as against a party who has not only filed but served an action of its own.</P>
<P>178. This Action has, from the outset, included Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact as Defendants. KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, is against only CP. To bring this Action within the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, CP would have to initiate a Counterclaim against KPCL and claim against Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, Altus and Intact as parties, but this is already underway in this Action.</P>
<P>179. Then, of course, the question will arise about the propriety of dragging Altus and Thurber to Saskatchewan, when they have defended in Alberta. On the other hand, if the Action proceeds in Alberta, the issues will all be addressed, against all relevant parties, in one Action.</P>
<P>180. Allowing this Action to proceed will also allow determination of the issues in the Saskatchewan Actions, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplicative proceedings. The issues are, in substance, the same, as they relate to issues arising from the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. KPCL should not be rewarded for having waited to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action or for filing a further duplicative claim by being allowed to rely on the Saskatchewan Actions as reason to transfer this Action out of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>181. While CP recognizes that juridical advantage is of less weight in assessing jurisdiction as between provinces than in an international context, in this instance proceedings in Alberta, CP's chosen forum, offer two juridical benefits. There is no basis upon which to deprive CP of either.</P>
<P>182. One is a benefit to all parties in the context of this litigation. Under the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, there is no formal limit to the number of corporate witnesses who may be questioned. In contrast, under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, parties are entitled to question only one representative of a corporation in the absence of a Court Order.</P>
<P>183. Under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>5-19</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In the case of a corporation, anyone who is or has been an officer or employee of the corporation may:

<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>After questioning anyone who is or has been an officer or employee of a corporation, <UNDER>a party may not question any other person who is or has been an officer or employee of the corporation without an order of the Court</UNDER>.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>

<P>184. While it might be possible to question additional parties by way of agreement or through Court Order, a further procedural difficulty arises in respect of the status of the evidence given by those witnesses. The witnesses identified to date are employees, contractors and/or former employees or contractors of the parties. Under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, even if such individuals are questioned, their information may not be used in evidence:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>5.19</N><SSEC><N>(3)</N><SSECP>The questioning of a person who is an employee of a corporation, or who has been an officer or employee of a corporation, must not be used in evidence.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(4)</N><SSECP>The questioning of a person who is an officer of the corporation must only be used as evidence against the corporation if permitted in accordance with subrules (5) to (7).</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(5)</N><SSECP>Any party desiring to question an officer of a corporation for the purpose of using the questioning as evidence may apply to the Court to designate the proper person to be so questioned.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(6)</N><SSECP>On an application pursuant to subrule (5) and after making any inquiries that the Court considers fit, the Court shall designate the proper person to be questioned, and the questioning of the person designated may be used as evidence against the corporation, saving all just exceptions.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(7)</N><SSECP>If the parties agree on the proper person to be questioned, the Court is not required to make any designation pursuant to subrule (6), and the questioning of that person may be used as evidence against the corporation, saving all just exceptions.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> Tab 39 at Rule 5.19</P1></P>
<P>185. If the parties were limited to questioning on this basis, the analysis of comparative convenience in terms of numbers, to the extent that analysis is relevant, would remain neutral. Assuming the designation of corporate witnesses as follows, the location of the parties' witnesses would be as follows:

<P>186. As this shows, if questioning was to proceed under the Saskatchewan framework, the convenience analysis would remain neutral, with the Alberta and Saskatchewan witnesses equally balanced.</P>
<P>187. It would, however, give rise to significant additional procedural difficulties. There appears to be agreement between the parties that multiple witnesses from each party will need to be examined.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g., Panteluk Affidavit at para 78, Record of Proceedings at page A19; Paton Affidavit at para 24, Record of Proceedings at pages A546 - A547; Clifton Affidavit at para 24, Record of Proceedings at page A306.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Especially in light of the extensive list of &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; witnesses put forth by the respondents and by KPCL in particular, it is at best disingenuous for the Respondents to suggest that limited questioning constitutes a juridical advantage in favour of Saskatchewan. For the same reason, it is equally disingenuous for the Respondents to argue that the limited use that may be made of questioning of any witness other than the designated corporate representative is an advantage of proceeding in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>188. Further, based on the information from all of the parties regarding the scope of questioning required, it was incorrect for Master Prowse to conclude that the limitation of questioning to one witness per party constituted a juridical advantage in favour of Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at para 71, Record of Proceedings at page A1084.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While this could, perhaps, be addressed by agreement amongst counsel, given the complex and highly technical nature of the subject matter of this claim, it is important to ensure that fulsome questioning is available.</P>
<P>189. Further, if this Action is stayed or set aside, the defendants may attempt to argue that CP is barred from proceeding with an action in Saskatchewan by virtue of <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, which may be the actual motivation behind KPCL's multiplicity of actions and applications. In contrast, there is no question that CP's Statement of Claim in this Action was filed and served within the appropriate time limit. It would, to put it mildly, be a significant loss of the juridical advantage of proceeding in Alberta if CP were to find itself time barred in an alternate forum.
<P1><EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 40</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>190. This issue was a concern for Master Prowse. He questioned counsel for the Respondents on this point during the initial hearing.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Proceedings at page 31, lines 35 - 36, Record of Proceedings at page A989.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In response, counsel for KPCL <UNDER>offered</UNDER> the confirmation that KPCL would, if the Court was concerned about the potential that CP would be prejudiced by the limitation period applicable in Saskatchewan:
<QUOTE><P>be agreeable to an order that provides that KPCL would not assert that the CP claim is barred because of a limitation period if ... the claim would not be barred pursuant to the limitation rule that would be applied by the Alberta court. ... [and] would provide an undertaking not to rely on limitations in that manner or an undertaking to act consistent with that provision of the legislation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Proceedings at page 35, lines 26&ndash;32, Record of Proceedings at page A993.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>191. Master Prowse's Order, accordingly, incorporated the Respondents' offer and directed the Respondents to provide undertakings confirming that if this Action were to proceed in Saskatchewan, they would not seek to rely upon any limitations defence not available in Alberta, a matter which it appears they now seek to appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Decision at para 75, Record of Proceedings at page A1084.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>192. It is of significant concern to CP that, as of the date of this brief, only three of the four respondents to this appeal have complied with the Order in respect of the undertaking not to raise limitation defences as against CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Copies of the Undertakings filed by KPCL, Clifton and Intact are attached as Appendix D.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Of even more concern, especially in view of the fact that counsel for KPCL expressly offered this undertaking as a potential solution to concerns regarding the juridical disadvantage to CP arising in connection with the limitation period question, is the fact that all four Respondents have initiated separate appeals in which CP understands they are challenging that portion of Master Prowse's Order which required the undertaking as to non-reliance on limitation defences not available in Alberta. Taken together, CP submits that its concern regarding limitation periods, which do not pose an issue if the Action proceeds in Alberta as it should, give rise to significant concerns about fairness that weigh heavily in favour of rejecting the suggestion that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum.</P>
<P>193. If this Court determines that CP's choice of forum and the submission to jurisdiction of Thurber and Altus should be disregarded, and concludes that the jurisdictional provisions in the contracts between CP and Hatch and CP and Clifton need not be honoured, any resulting transfer of this Action should be undertaken pursuant to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1, such that they are transferred in as at the date commenced in Alberta.
<P1><EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 41</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Attornment to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>194. Taking steps to contest the substantive merits of a claim is the principal hallmark of attornment. Filing an application to object to the jurisdiction of the forum is not attornment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Manson v Canada (Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 212</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 42</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>195. The suggestion that this Action be stayed or set aside in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan appears to ignore the fact that a portion of CP's claim will remain within the jurisdiction. CP's Statement of Claim against Thurber and Altus is separate and apart from the Jurisdiction Applications. These claims, as well as any claims arising under the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, will need to be addressed in any event.</P>
<P>196. CP intentionally has not, to this point, taken any steps to contest the merits of either of the Saskatchewan Actions. Rather, CP has sought only to address initial matters preliminary to potential applications in respect of jurisdiction. This does not constitute attornment.</P>
<P>197. In <CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC></CASEREF>, the defendant brought a motion to stay the Plaintiff's action in Ontario, and submitted that Quebec was the more appropriate forum for the action. The plaintiff filed his action in Ontario, then the defendant brought a parallel action in Quebec. After both actions had commenced, the plaintiff brought a motion for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief. That relief was granted. In the course of granting a stay of the Ontario action, the Court explained that:
<QUOTE><P>the defendant has not attorned to the Ontario Court's jurisdiction but <UNDER>was required to respond to the plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief</UNDER> because the plaintiff refused the defendant's request for an adjournment of the plaintiff's motion and to permit her first to bring a motion to contest the forum. As such, <UNDER>the defendant came before [the justice hearing the injunction motion] under duress</UNDER>, after clearly signalling her intention to contest jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>198. Similarly, in this case CP was required to respond to KPCL's Originating Application, as KPCL had amply demonstrated its unwillingness to adjourn pending the hearing of its existing Jurisdiction Application. CP has, from its first interactions with KPCL, signalled its intention to contest jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and has taken no steps to contest the merits of either matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>INTRODUCTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Defendant/Respondent/Cross-Appellant, CLIFTON ASSOCIATES. LTD. (&ldquo;<EM>Clifton</EM>&rdquo;), submits this Brief pursuant to rule 6.14(6)(a) of the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> as further written argument in response to the Brief of the Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-Respondent, CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY (&ldquo;<EM>CP</EM>&rdquo;), filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>CP Appeal Brief</EM>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Three overarching issues are dealt with in the appeal by CP and the appeals by Clifton and the other Defendants/Respondents/Cross-Appellants (collectively, the &ldquo;<EM>Respondents</EM>&rdquo;), namely: jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>; <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>; and the appropriate remedy to be granted by this Honourable Court. All of these issues were argued in front of Master Prowse as a result of the Respondents? applications for a stay of these proceedings and dealt with extensively in the materials filed. As set out in its Appeal Brief filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Appeal Brief</EM>&rdquo;), Clifton agrees with Master Prowse's conclusion that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> but objects to the remedy granted by him.</P>
<P>3. For brevity, and to avoid repeating the law and arguments in the Original Clifton Brief {Tab A} and the Clifton Appeal Brief, Clifton has confined this Responding Brief to reply to two issues raised in the CP Appeal Brief.</P>
<P>4. First, in supplement to the Original Clifton Brief regarding the test for determining <EM>forum conveniens</EM>, this Responding Brief will address whether Master Prowse applied the appropriate standard. Clifton says he did. Second, this Responding Brief will discuss CP's contention that Alberta has a juridical advantage due to its rules for oral discovery. Clifton says that this argument should be given little, if any, weight because the principle of comity does not permit foreign rules of civil procedure to be parsed in the manner suggested by CP. Alternatively, even if compared with the process delineated in the Alberta <EM>Rules</EM>, Saskatchewan procedure is sufficiently robust to dispose of any of the procedural &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; CP contends will arise.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>LAW AND ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Standard of Review</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. Clifton agrees with Paragraphs 60 and 61 of CP's Appeal Brief setting out the applicable rule and standard of review.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Appropriate Standard to Determine <EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>6. At Paragraphs 143 and 144 of its Appeal Brief, CP claims that Master Prowse initially cited the correct standard for granting a stay on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, namely that the other forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, but ultimately applied an incorrect standard, specifically that the other forum is &ldquo;likely more suitable&rdquo;. A reading of the whole of the decision, however, leads to the indisputable conclusion that this ground of appeal must fail.</P>
<P>7. When read in context, it is apparent that Master Prowse's use of the phrase &ldquo;likely more suitable&rdquo; was part of <EM>obiter dictum</EM> addressing issues arising from CP's position that it should not be denied its choice of forum lightly.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,081 (Reasons for Judgment at para 52).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Specifically, Master Prowse was concerned that, if CP applied to stay the Saskatchewan proceedings initiated by KPCL and the Saskatchewan Court also took the approach that it should not deny KPCL its choice of forum lightly, a multiplicity of actions would be created with no way to resolve the &ldquo;potential deadlock&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,081 and 1,082 (Reasons for Judgment at paras 54-55).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's response that a Saskatchewan Court &ldquo;...would be influenced...&rdquo; by an Alberta Court's ruling on <EM>forum conveniens</EM> appeared to be unsatisfactory to the Learned Master. He postulated that, if that position was accepted, a tactical disadvantage could arise for the party first making an application for a ruling on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in all cases in which parallel proceedings exist&mdash;in his words, &ldquo;a race away from the courthouse&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,081 and 1,082 (Reasons for Judgment at para 56).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. Master Prowse commented that, in cases where parallel proceedings exist, one way to solve the dilemma would be to &ldquo;...simply determine which forum is likely more suitable...&rdquo;, as opposed to requiring that an applicant prove the other forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;. The Learned Master nonetheless applied the &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo; standard urged to be used by CP, leading him to conclude that &ldquo;...Saskatchewan is <UNDER>clearly more appropriate</UNDER> as the forum conveniens.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,084 (Reasons for Judgment at para 72) [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, even though he used the phrase &ldquo;likely more suitable&rdquo; in <EM>obiter</EM>, he did not use any such standard to determine the question before him.</P>
<P>9. There is another possible solution to the &ldquo;race away from the courthouse&rdquo; dilemma raised by Master Prowse that this Honourable Court could employ. In cases where parallel proceedings exist, some Courts have applied a modified <EM>forum n on conveniens</EM> analysis. In <EM>Westec</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Westec Aerospace Inc v Raytheon Aircraft Company</SOC><CITE>1999 BCCA 243</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>Westec</EM>] {Tab 9}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> for example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal applied a three-part <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis:
<P1>(a) Is there a parallel proceeding in a foreign forum?;</P1>
<P1>(b) Is the foreign forum appropriate for the dispute?; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Has the domestic plaintiff established that there is a personal or juridical advantage available only in the domestic forum of which it would be unjust to deprive them?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>10. In that case, Raytheon filed a suit against Westec in Kansas seeking a declaration that it had not breached a contract. Westec subsequently filed a claim in British Columbia seeking damages for breach of that same contract. Raytheon applied to stay the British Columbia action on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. The Chambers Judge dismissed the application because there was no compelling reason to deprive Westec of its choice of forum; Raytheon appealed.</P>
<P>11. The British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the Chambers Judge, holding that, because there were parallel proceedings in &ldquo;an appropriate forum&rdquo;, the British Columbia claim should be stayed unless Westec &ldquo;...would lose a juridical or personal advantage that is of such importance that it would cause injustice to Westec to be deprived of it.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court of Appeal found that Westec had established no such advantage and was instead depending on &ldquo;...unstated and unsavory assumptions about the quality of American justice...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. The Supreme Court of Canada cited <EM>Westec</EM> in <EM>Teck</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Teck Cominco Metals Ltd v Lloyd's Underwriters</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 11</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) <EM>[Teck]</EM> {Tab 6}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There, the appellant argued that the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis under British Columbia's <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> should &ldquo;...give way to a &lsquo;comity-based&rsquo; test when a foreign court positively asserts jurisdiction...&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 23</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Alternatively, it argued that &ldquo;...the assertion of jurisdiction by the foreign court is an overriding and determinative factor...&rdquo; in that analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appellant cited <EM>Westec</EM> in support of these arguments.</P>
<P>13. Chief Justice McLachlin explained that <EM>Westec</EM> did not support the appellant's arguments because, in <EM>Westec</EM>, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had still considered the other <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> factors.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 26-27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, <EM>Westec</EM> and <EM>Teck</EM> together stand for the proposition that, in cases with parallel proceedings, a Court may apply a modified <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis if it still considers the relevant <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> factors.</P>
<P>14. Although the <EM>Westec</EM> approach looks somewhat different from the traditional <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis, it involves the same factors and standard. It is simply reorganized to give more weight to the existence of a parallel proceeding and the multiplicity of proceedings that would result if one of the proceedings is not stayed. As Justice Hillier of this Court has noted, &ldquo;...the [<EM>forum non conveniens</EM>] factors bear differing weight with each case...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>TR Technologies Inc v Verizon Communications Incorporated</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 390 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF> Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. In cases where parallel proceedings exist, therefore, it is appropriate to modify the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis to emphasize the parallel proceedings factor and give the other factors less weight, provided that they are still considered to some extent. Though Master Prowse used the traditional <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis, it would have been open to him to use the <EM>Westec</EM> approach. Either way, the existence of a parallel proceeding is an important factor and must be a central part of the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. In a case where a parallel proceeding exists, the approach urged by CP, under which a Court generally defers to the plaintiff's choice of forum, leads to either a multiplicity of proceedings (if both forums defer to their plaintiff's choice of forum) or a race away from the courthouse (if the second forum defers to the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> determination made in the first forum).</P>
<P>16. Hence, Master Prowse was entirely correct to give significant consideration to the existence of the Saskatchewan proceedings. This Honourable Court should do the same, either by accepting Master Prowse's application of the traditional <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis or using the <EM>Westec</EM> analysis. Both approaches lead to the conclusion that Saskatchewan is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>. Accordingly, CP's appeal should be denied.</P></BLOCK3>

At Paragraphs 181 to 188 of the CP Appeal Brief, CP argues that Saskatchewan's <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM> put it at a juridical disadvantage because the number of witnesses who may be questioned is restricted and only the evidence of the proper officer of the corporate Respondents can be used at trial. Notwithstanding saying that this factor favours allowing its Appeal, CP acknowledges that it is one to be given &ldquo;...less weight as between provinces...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 181.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. In contrast, Clifton says that this factor should not be given any weight for the reasons that follow. Alternatively, if this Honourable Court considers the differences to have some weight, they should not influence its determination to the extent of allowing CP's Appeal. At best, the differences in civil procedure are a neutral factor as between the parties, a conclusion with which CP agrees,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 186.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and any alleged or perceived procedural difficulties do not, in fact, arise as CP suggests.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 187.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Since there will always be minor, or perhaps even major, differences in civil procedure as between jurisdictions, CP's argument is not unique. Westec made a similar one in <EM>Westec</EM> by claiming that British Columbia's summary trial procedure was a juridical advantage to it. The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed Westec's argument, finding that such an argument undermines the principle of comity:
<QUOTE><P>[53] If this factor alone were considered cogent evidence of an important juridical advantage, a litigant would be free to commence parallel proceedings in this Province whenever it had been sued in a jurisdiction which lacks the equivalent summary trial procedure available under Rule 18A of the Rules of Court. Such a ruling could have sweeping consequences and offends the principle of comity by refusing to acknowledge the efficacy of proceedings brought in jurisdictions which do not mirror exactly the procedural rules of this Province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supra</EM> note 5 at para 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>20. In the circumstances of this case, differences between civil procedure rules in Saskatchewan and Alberta should not be considered &ldquo;cogent evidence&rdquo; of an important juridical advantage because, when thoroughly assessed, they are not as significant a factor as CP contends. Specifically, they do not rise to the level of depriving CP of &ldquo;...a personal or juridical advantage available <UNDER>only</UNDER> in the domestic forum...&rdquo; As such, even under the modified <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> test Clifton urges the Court to use, CP will not be deprived of any alleged or perceived advantage in Alberta such that an unjustness would result if these proceedings are stayed.</P>
<P>21. Moreover, CP's assertion that there is an agreement that &ldquo;...multiple witnesses from each party will need to be examined...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 187.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> at Questioning is erroneous. The necessary witnesses identified by the parties are, for the most part, witnesses expected to testify <UNDER>at trial</UNDER>. If necessary to ensure fulsome oral discovery, their same evidence can be obtained through the Questioning process in Saskatchewan, albeit somewhat differently than how it would be done in Alberta. Since the Saskatchewan procedure avoids the attendant time and cost associated with extended examinations of multiple witnesses &ldquo;by right&rdquo; while concurrently offering the flexibility to obtain comprehensive discovery, staying these proceedings in Alberta does not result in the loss of juridical advantage to CP.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI>Questioning in Saskatchewan</TI>
<P>22. By comparison to Alberta procedure, there are two restrictions on the questioning of employees of a corporate party in Saskatchewan. The first is that, once a questioner has questioned one officer or employee of a corporate party, s/he cannot question another without obtaining a Court Order to do so.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Saskatchewan Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Rule 5-19(2) {Tab 13}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, CP is not precluded from examining the employees or officers of any corporate Respondent it wants; it is simply required to take an additional step before doing so. While CP contends that this step is prohibitive, there is evidence that it is not. Specifically, Robert Gibbings, a lawyer who has been practicing in Saskatchewan since 1981, has given evidence that the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench &ldquo;typically grants such orders if there is no serious dispute about the reasonableness of the request to question further witnesses.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings filed on March 29, 2018, at Exhibit A, para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. By comparison, the second restriction on the Questioning of a corporate party in Saskatchewan is that the transcript of a former officer or a current or former employee (anyone other than the &ldquo;proper officer&rdquo;, i.e.&mdash;the corporate representative) cannot be used in evidence. The only transcript of evidence that can be used at trial is that of the proper officer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Saskatchewan Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Rule 5-19(3)&ndash;(7) {Tab 13}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The logic supporting the restriction is apparent&mdash;the only evidence that should bind a corporate party is evidence it acknowledges.</P>
<P>24. While CP contends that this restriction is unique to Saskatchewan, a similar restriction exists in rule 5.29(1) of the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>. The Alberta rule simply qualifies the restriction by allowing evidence given by a &ldquo;corporate witness&rdquo; to be used at trial against the corporate defendant if the corporate representative (i.e.&mdash;proper officer) &ldquo;acknowledges that the evidence forms some of the information of the corporation.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Rule 5.29(1) {Tab 11}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Saskatchewan's <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM> do not contain the acknowledgement qualification in rule 5.29(1) of the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, but there is no reason that a questioner could not have an employee's evidence admitted using a process similar to the process employed in Alberta. In fact, the process codified in rule 5.29 developed in Alberta under rule 214(1) of the old <EM>Rules of Court</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>AMEC Americas Limited v Attila Dogan Construction and Installation Co Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 366 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Tab 1, cited with approval in <CASEREF><SOC>XS Technologies Inc v Veritas DGC Land Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABCA 165 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>21-22</PARANUM></CASEREF> Tab 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rule 214(1) provided only that the evidence of a corporate representative could be used as evidence against a corporation:
<QUOTE><P>Any party to an action or issue may at the trial or on motion use in evidence as against any opposite party any part of the examination of that opposite party, <BOLD>or in case the opposite party is a corporation, of the examination of any representative thereof selected to submit to an examination to be so used</BOLD> [emphasis added].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Old <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Rule 214(1) {Tab 12}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. Although the old Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM> did not explicitly provide for such a practice, Judges and Masters of this Honourable Court found that a questioner could put excerpts from the transcripts of examined employees to the corporate representative. That representative was then asked to confirm that the evidence forms some of the evidence of the corporate party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Esso Resources Canada Ltd v Stearns Catalytic Ltd</SOC><CITE>1992 CanLII 6247</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras 2, 5, 6, 10 {Tab 2}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If the corporate representative acknowledged an employee's evidence, it could be read in at trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Esso Resources Canada Ltd v Stearns Catalytic Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1993 CanLII 7255</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 31 {Tab 3}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. There appears to be no Saskatchewan case law on this approach to the use of employee evidence. Since there is no procedural prohibition, it follows that there is no reason to believe that it could not be used in Saskatchewan and good reason to believe that it would be in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the restriction on using an employee's answers given in Questioning that CP alleges is a juridical disadvantage is not an insurmountable barrier.</P>
<P>28. Even if the transcript of the Questioning of an employee is not used for read-ins, Saskatchewan civil procedure permits its use for impeachment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tundra Mechanical &amp; Millwrighting (1988) Ltd. v Ecco Heating Products Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1996 CanLII 7199</CITE><COURTJUR>Sask QB</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 9 {Tab 8}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Moreover, questioning employees is not the only way to obtain their evidence. A proper officer in Saskatchewan is required to inform himself of the issues in the litigation by making such inquiries as are necessary in advance of Questioning.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Saskatchewan Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Rule 5-25(a) {Tab 13}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If that proper officer is unable to answer a question, he can provide an undertaking, which can include obtaining information by asking another employee or officer of the corporation. In fact, the proper officer must accept an undertaking to make enquiries of current or former employees of the corporation if the undertaking is relevant and it is possible to obtain the information &ldquo;...without unreasonable expense...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Signcorp Investments Ltd. v Cairns Homes Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1988 CanLII 5357</CITE><COURTJUR>Sask QB</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 6 {Tab 5}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, it is absolutely possible for a questioner to obtain evidence from a corporate party's employees in Saskatchewan without needing to examine them directly.</P>
<P>30. Finally, the comments of Justice Halvorson of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in <EM>International Minerals</EM> explain the merits of Saskatchewan's restrictions on Questioning.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp. (Canada) Ltd. v Commonwealth Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>1992 CanLII 7884</CITE><COURTJUR>Sask QB</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>International Minerals</EM>] {Tab 4}.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>International Minerals</EM> was an extremely complex case regarding the flooding of a mine. Damages were almost $500 million, and as of the date of Justice Halvorson's decision, there had been 160 days of discovery of the plaintiffs' proper officers. The defendants applied for leave to examine former employees of the plaintiffs in lieu of obtaining their evidence through the plaintiffs' proper officers. Justice Halvorson dismissed the application because expanding the Questioning of employees would cause its own problems for the litigation generally and the employees in particular:
<QUOTE><P>The argument could be advanced that the complexity of this lawsuit justifies examinations of nonparties. <BOLD>A counterargument is that due to the complexity, the normal discovery procedure should be followed to prevent the discovery process from taking off in all directions.</BOLD> Moreover, if the defendants are allowed to examine these former employees because of dissatisfaction with the undertakings process, then the other parties could seek the same relief. Significantly, the defendants ask to examine these employees respecting only several of the many issues pleaded. Presumably, other nonparties with personal information could be examined touching other pleadings. <BOLD>Multiple examinations could result. That would not be beneficial to the orderly progression of this litigation.</BOLD></P>
<P>No doubt it would be more efficient for the defendants if they could examine for discovery each person from whom the plaintiffs' officers elicit information. This would facilitate the defendants in cross-examining that person. Better flow in the questions would result. Probably it would be easier to pin down that person's story. But rule 222A is not geared to suit the party wishing to examine. Rather, as was stated in <EM>Weiszman</EM>, <BOLD>the rule attempts to balance the inconvenience to a nonparty compelled to attend for examination with the desirability of granting a party access to information unattainable in other ways</BOLD> [emphasis added].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 21 [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. Justice Halvorson's comments are equally applicable in this litigation. While it may be easier for a questioner to get certain evidence by questioning employees directly, it is legitimate to balance the convenience of the questioner with the convenience of those employees and, more importantly, the efficient progress of the litigation as a whole.</P>
<P>32. In all of the circumstances, therefore, there is no juridical advantage that CP will lose if these proceedings are stayed. All of the procedures available in Alberta to obtain a &ldquo;fulsome questioning&rdquo; are similarly available in Saskatchewan. The fact that there is a different way to get to the same result is not prohibitive and, thus, the differences should have no bearing as a factor that favours allowing CP's Appeal.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>This brief is filed to support the appeal of Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;) and replaces the brief filed by KPCL in advance of the Masters Hearing before Master Prowse.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></TI>
<P>1. The core of this matter relates to a construction project located in Saskatchewan for the construction of a new, 30.4 km railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Panteluk Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which was designed for construction in Saskatchewan, was constructed in Saskatchewan by a Saskatchewan company, and suffered a foundation failure in Saskatchewan; a failure that was investigated, redesigned, and repaired in Saskatchewan. It involves seven parties, all of whom carry on business in Saskatchewan, alleged torts committed in Saskatchewan, contracts made in Saskatchewan or outside Alberta, and involves conduct predominantly carried out in Saskatchewan. The applicable lien legislation is the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, SS 1984-85-86, c B-7.1 [<EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. The Defendant KPCL has no presence in Alberta. The connections to Alberta of the other parties, and the core of the dispute, are minimal and incidental and do not establish a real and substantial connection to Alberta.</P>
<P>3. By way of an application filed on February 8, 2018, KPCL seeks to set aside the Statement of Claim of Canadian Pacific Railway (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in this action (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Action</BOLD>&rdquo;) for want of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, seeks a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Application</BOLD>&rdquo;). Three of the other Defendants in this Action, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;, and collectively with KPCL, Hatch, and Clifton, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Objecting Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;) filed similar applications challenging this Court's jurisdiction and asserting that Alberta is not the appropriate forum for this Action (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application by KPCL filed February 8, 2018; Application by Clifton filed February 23, 2018; Application by Intact filed March 26, 2018; Application by Hatch filed March 29, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The two remaining defendants named in the in the Action, Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;, and collectively with Altus, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Attorning Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;) have not contested this Court's jurisdiction or otherwise taken a position in the Jurisdiction Applications, but have instead filed Statements of Defence and Notices of Claim against the Objecting Defendants (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Notices to Co-Defendant</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice of Claim against Co-Defendants filed April 5, 2018; Altus Notice of Claim against Co-Defendants, filed May 2, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. The Jurisdiction Applications were heard by Master Prowse on July 4 and 5, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hearing</BOLD>&rdquo;). Master Prowse issued his decision on July 25, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Decision</BOLD>&rdquo;). He held that this Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over all of the Objecting Defendants but also that the Action should be stayed as against the Objecting Defendants on the basis that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P>
<P>5. KPCL appeals the Decision with respect to jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. KPCL has confined its activities entirely to Saskatchewan, and has done nothing to bring itself within the scope of any contractual relationship made in Alberta. There is no real and substantial connection between Alberta and the claims against KPCL, and this Court cannot assume jurisdiction over KPCL.</P>
<P>6. KPCL also appeals portions of the Decision with respect to <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Master Prowse correctly identified that &ldquo;Saskatchewan is clearly more appropriate as the forum conveniens.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, rather than staying the Action in its entirety, Master Prowse erred by only staying the Action as against the four Objecting Defendants. In doing so, he likely effected &ldquo;the worst possible outcome&rdquo;, namely &ldquo;concurrent litigation in both provinces, with attendant wasted costs and possible inconsistent verdicts.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL submits that the entire Action should be stayed in favour of Saskatchewan, in order to ensure that the Action is tried in the jurisdiction that has the closest connection with the Action and the parties, while also avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings. In the alternative, if the Action is stayed in favour of Saskatchewan only as against the Objecting Defendants, KPCL submits that the Notices to Co-Defendants should also be expressly stayed by this Court.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. ISSUES</TI>
<P>36. The determination of KPCL's appeal requires the Court to address the following issues:
<P1>(a) Does the Alberta Court have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over KPCL or the claims made against KPCL?</P1>
<P1>(b) If the answer to (a) is yes, is Alberta <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>?</P1></P>
<P>37. For the reasons that follow, KPCL submits that this Court does not have jurisdiction over KPCL or the claims made against KPCL in the Action. Even if this Court does find that it has jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> over KPCL, it should defer to the clearly more appropriate forum of Saskatchewan and decline to exercise its jurisdiction by staying the entire Action, as against all Defendants, in favour of Saskatchewan. If this Court elects to adopt the approach of Master Prowse and stays the Action only as against the Objecting Defendants, KPCL submits that the Notices to Co-Defendant should also be expressly stayed pending the resolution of the Saskatchewan Proceedings between CP and the Objecting Defendants.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>42. In this case, CP has failed to establish that this Court has jurisdiction over KPCL under any of the three jurisdictional bases.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Presence-Based Jurisdiction</TI>
<P>43. Presence-based jurisdiction is based on the requirement and sufficiency of personal service of the originating process within the province or territory of the forum (service <EM>in juris</EM>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 83 [<BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> To establish traditional, presence-based jurisdiction over an out-of-province corporate defendant, it must also be shown that the defendant was carrying on business in the forum at the time of the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at paras 85 and 89 [<BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has not asserted presence-based jurisdiction against KPCL, for good reason: KPCL was served <EM>ex juris</EM>, at its office in Estevan, Saskatchewan<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;C&rdquo; Affidavit of Justin Meyer sworn February 28, 2018, para 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and was not carrying on business in Alberta at the time of the Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Consent-Based Jurisdiction</TI>
<P>44. The KPCL Contract does not contain a choice of jurisdiction clause. Further, when served with the Statement of Claim by CP, KPCL took steps to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court to hear this Action by filing the KPCL Application. KPCL has not filed a Statement of Defence and has not taken any actions to defend itself on the merits in this Action or to otherwise engage or attorn to the jurisdiction of this Court.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii.</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Assumed Jurisdiction</TI>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(1)</EM></N><TI><EM>General Principles</EM></TI>
<P>45. The third basis for jurisdiction is assumed jurisdiction, which developed through the adoption of rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 83 [<BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Before a court can assume jurisdiction over a claim, a &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo; connection must be shown between the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the jurisdiction where the claim is brought.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lapointe Rosenstein Marchand Melancon LLP v Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 30</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Lapointe</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The real and substantial connection test has evolved into an important constitutional test or principle that imposes limits on the reach of a province's laws and courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If met, it establishes a territorial basis for, and therefore, a territorial limit to, a court's ability to reach into other jurisdictions and affect the rights of non-consenting foreign defendants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. In order to properly respect the court's territorial limits, it is necessary to distinguish between the <EM>Rules</EM> for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, and the substantive rules relating to the assumption of jurisdiction. The procedural rules &ldquo;are nothing more than a means of giving notice of a proceeding to a person who might be interested in knowing about it&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 67 [<BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is a different concept from assumption of, or establishing, jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, while the <EM>Rules</EM> must be followed in order for service <EM>ex juris</EM> to be valid, as acknowledged by CP,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Brief and Authorities of the Respondent, Canadian Pacific Railway Company, filed June 22, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP Hearing Brief</BOLD>&rdquo;), pp. 21, para 94.

<P>47. In Alberta, <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(1) provides that a commencement document can only be served outside of Alberta and in Canada if &ldquo;a real and substantial connection exists between Alberta and the facts on which a claim in an action is based.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Rules</EM>, r 11.25 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The authority for the legislated extension of the jurisdiction by the Provinces is found in section 92(14) of the <EM>Constitution Act, 1867</EM> which is the power over &ldquo;the administration of justice <EM>in the province</EM>&rdquo; [emphasis added].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Constitution Act, 1867</EM> (UK), 30 &amp; 31 Vict, c 3, reprinted in RSC 1985, Appendix II, No 5 [<BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Legislative enactments that extend jurisdiction are, therefore, subject to the &ldquo;in the province&rdquo; requirement of section 92(14).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Equustek Solutions Inc v Google Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 BCCA 265</CITE><PARANUM>48 and 49</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>2017 SCC 34</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 19</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>Van Breda</EM> confirmed that a province's service <EM>ex juris</EM> legislation is only &ldquo;in the province&rdquo; and, therefore, a legitimate exercise of the power of the Legislature of a Province, if it is limited to matters that have a real and substantial connection to the Province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 21 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the real and substantial connection test and its analytical framework, which involves two stages of analysis:
<P1>(a) the plaintiff has the onus and burden to establish the existence of one or more objective, presumptive factors connecting the action or the defendant to the plaintiff's chosen jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Gulevich v Miller</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 411</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Gulevich</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiff must establish that one or more of the identified listed presumptive factors exists,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or that the Court should identify a new factor which also presumptively entitles the Court to take jurisdiction;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM>, at para 91 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(b) if the plaintiff proves a presumptive connecting factor, it remains open to the defendant to rebut the presumption of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> by demonstrating that in the circumstances of the particular case, the presumptive connecting factor does not point to any real relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum, or points only to a weak connection.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 95 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>49. If the Court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction because none of the presumptive connecting factors exist or because the presumption of jurisdiction that flows from one of those factors has been rebutted, it must dismiss or stay the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 100 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, CP has failed to establish that any presumptive connecting factors apply to KPCL, and the Action should therefore be dismissed or stayed.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(2)</EM></N><TI><EM>None of the Identified Presumptive Connecting Factors Apply to KPCL</EM></TI>
<P>50. CP's claims against KPCL, and the other Defendants in the Action, are based in tort and contract.</P>
<P>51. The list of identified presumptive connecting factors grounding a court's assumption of jurisdiction over tort claims has been settled by the Supreme Court of Canada. They are: (a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province; (b) the defendant carries on business in the province; (c) the tort was committed in the province; and (d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 90 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 36 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. The presumptive connecting factors in breach of contract cases has not had significant judicial consideration since <EM>Van Breda</EM>. In Alberta, it has been suggested that, in addition to the defendant being resident or carrying on business in the jurisdiction, presumptive connecting factors in a breach of contract case are (a) a contract or alleged contract is made, performed or breached in Alberta; and (b) a tort connected with the contract was committed in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bansal v Ferrera Pan Candy Co</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 384</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 21</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Osman v Markplan Inc</SOC><CITE>2018 ABCA 215</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 22</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>56. Under these principles, the evidence is clear that KPCL does not carry on any business in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL does not and has never had a physical office in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has not carried on any work in Alberta since 1995.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has not had any personnel operating on behalf of KPCL in Alberta at any relevant time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has no permanent staff based in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI><EM>KPCL's Alleged Torts Were Not Committed in Alberta</EM></TI>
<P>57. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that in determining where a tort is committed it is unnecessary and unwise to have resort to a set of arbitrary rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Moran v Pyle National (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1975] 1 SCR 393</CITE><PAGENUM>at 408</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 25</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court noted that the use of the place of the damage sustained as a connecting factor may raise difficult issues and did not constitute a presumptive connecting factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 89 and 119 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The Alberta Court of Appeal has subsequently acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Canada, in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, was concerned that &ldquo;giving jurisdiction to a place where a plaintiff suffers pain and inconvenience creates uncertainty and opens the door to forums taking jurisdiction over tort actions that have little connection to the matter beyond the location of the plaintiff.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 42 [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to the Court of Appeal, the place where the tort is committed is the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by the respondent's activities or its consequences&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 46 [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. In this case, the Statement of Claim alleges KPCL breached a duty of care in its execution of work on the Project in Saskatchewan pursuant to the KPCL Contract and was negligent in the performance of its work.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 89&ndash;108.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's damages claimed against KPCL relate to the allegation that KPCL's negligence contributed to the Foundation Failure,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 110.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which occurred in Saskatchewan, and the failure to obtain course of construction insurance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> All of KPCL's activity in the performance of the KPCL Contract, including all construction efforts and the obtaining of insurance, occurred in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 33, 34, and 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The damages CP claims all relate to the costs of investigating the Foundation Failure, and the costs to redesign and reconstruct the Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. In this case, KPCL's alleged torts occurred in Saskatchewan and it is beyond doubt that the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by [KPCL]'s activities or its consequences&rdquo; is Saskatchewan. CP recognized this, and did not rely on Rule 11.25(3)(d) in its Statement of Claim as a ground for service <EM>ex juris</EM> in the Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI><EM>KPCL's Contract was Not Performed or Breached in Alberta</EM></TI>
<P>61. The uncontroverted evidence is that all work performed by KPCL related to the Project occurred in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 38 and 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> To the extent that KPCL is alleged to have breached the KPCL Contract by failing to obtain the requisite insurance coverage, there is no evidence or allegation that such breach occurred in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no basis to suggest that KPCL performed or breached the KPCL Contract in Alberta.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI><EM>No Tort Connected to the KPCL Contract was Committed in Alberta</EM>.</TI>
<P>62. CP alleges negligence against all Defendants, other than Intact.

<P>63. As noted earlier, KPCL's alleged negligence was not committed in Alberta&mdash;if it was committed at all, it was committed in Saskatchewan. The same analysis applies to the alleged claims of negligence against the other Defendants. In all cases, given that the Project was in Saskatchewan, and the alleged negligence &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>55</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea;</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 26</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> by way of the injury in the form of the Foundation Failure, which occurred in Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan is the &ldquo;place most substantially affected&rdquo; by the Defendants' alleged conduct and its consequences.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 46 [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64.

<BLOCK6><TI><EM>KPCL's Alleged Torts are not Connected to a Contract Made in Alberta</EM></TI>
<P>65. The first step in considering whether there is a &ldquo;contract connected to the dispute&rdquo; made in a jurisdiction is to identify the relevant dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 37 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In cases with multiple defendants, KPCL submits that the dispute to be considered must be the specific claim made against the foreign defendant, as opposed to claims which the plaintiff may have against other parties to the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, for example: <EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>66. Once the dispute is clearly identified, the plaintiff must establish that there is a contract made in the domestic forum which is connected to that dispute. For a contract to be connected to a dispute &ldquo;requires that a defendant's conduct brings him or her within the scope of the contractual relationship and that the events that give rise to the claim flow from the relationship created by the contract.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>], citing <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 116-117 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>67. Put another way, a plaintiff must meet three requirements to establish that a contract connected with a dispute was made in the province:
<P1>(a) there must be a contract that is made in the jurisdiction, as determined by the traditional rules of contract formation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 39 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Where the contracting parties are located in different jurisdictions, the contract will be formed in the jurisdiction where the last essential act of contract formation, generally communication of acceptance, took place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 40 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In cases where a contract is transmitted instantaneously, the last essential act of contract formation is the receipt of the accepted offer. Such contracts are therefore made in the jurisdiction where final acceptance of the contract is received;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 43 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) the events that give rise to the claim against the foreign defendant must flow from the relationship created by the domestic contract. In other words, the onus is on the plaintiff to establish that &lsquo;but for&rsquo; the domestic contract, the tort alleged against the foreign defendant would not have occurred;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 44 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 116-117 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(c) the foreign defendant's conduct must &ldquo;bring him or her within the scope of the contractual relationship.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 44 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 116-117 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Export Packers Company Limited International Transportation</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 481</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 28</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>68. KPCL submits that the third requirement's focus on the defendant's conduct is essential because &ldquo;parties must be able to predict with reasonable confidence whether a court will assume jurisdiction&rdquo; in a given case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 29 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 73 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A defendant's own conduct is all that it can control, and a defendant must therefore be able to rely to its own conduct to predict with reasonable certainty whether it has subjected itself to the jurisdiction of a foreign court. The focus on the defendant's conduct is therefore necessary to determine whether it is &ldquo;reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer legal proceedings&rdquo; in the forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 92 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>69. Circumstances in which courts have held that a foreign defendant's alleged conduct brings them within the scope of a domestic contract include situations where: (a) foreign defendant has negligently reviewed and provided legal advice respecting a domestic contract;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (b) a foreign defendant tortiously interfered with, or induced a breach of, a domestic contractual relationship;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Flying Frog Trading Co. v. Amer Sports Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1885</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 29</BOLD>], at para 31-32; aff'd <CASEREF><CITE>2018 BCCA 384</CITE><PARANUM>27&ndash;29</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 29</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and (c) through a chain of interrelated contracts and corporate entities, the foreign defendant has negligently provided services explicitly bargained for under a domestic contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Toews v. First Choice Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 784</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Toews</EM>], at para 57 [<BOLD>Tab 30</BOLD>] aff'd; <CASEREF><CITE>2016 ABQB 130</CITE></CASEREF>, [<EM>Toews QB</EM>] at para 42&ndash;44 and further aff'd <CASEREF><CITE>2016 ABCA 408</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Toews CA</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 31</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Based on these cases, KPCL submits that the plaintiff must show that it is the foreign defendant's allegedly tortious conduct which brings them within the scope of a domestic contractual relationship.</P>
<P>70. In this case, CP asserts in the Statement of Claim that &ldquo;the claim relates to contracts made in Alberta&rdquo;, but does not identify which contracts it refers to in the grounds for asserting jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In its Hearing brief, CP asserted only that the Thurber-Hatch Contract was entered into in Alberta and is connected to the dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Hearing Brief, para 110 [<BOLD>Appendix A</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At the Hearing, counsel for CP argued that both the Thurber-Hatch Contract and the Clifton Contract were made in Alberta and were connected to the dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal of Master's Judgment or Order filed by CP on August 22, 2018, Tab 2, Transcript of proceedings before the Master on July 5 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>July 5 Transcript</BOLD>&rdquo;), pp 28, lines 35&ndash;38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Finally, in the Decision, Master Prowse found that the Altus Contract was made in Alberta and was connected to the dispute against KPCL even though the Altus Contract was not in evidence and was not relied on by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, at para 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For clarity, each of the contracts identified in the Statement of Claim are briefly addressed below.</P>
<P>71. <BOLD><UNDER>The KPCL Contract was Not Made in Alberta</UNDER></BOLD>. KPCL negotiated the terms of the KPCL Contract out of its Saskatchewan office with CP through CP's Mississauga office. There is no allegation in the pleadings that the KPCL contract was made in Alberta, and the evidence shows that the KPCL contract was clearly not made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 20&ndash;28, and Exhibits &ldquo;5&rdquo;, &ldquo;6&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. <BOLD><UNDER>The Intact Contract was Not Made in Alberta</UNDER></BOLD>. Intact issued the Bonds in relation to the Project, at KPCL's request. These were approved in Ontario, and executed by Intact's attorney-in-fact and issued in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The issued Bonds were provided by Intact's agent&mdash;to KPCL in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no allegation in the pleadings, nor any evidence, that these contracts were made in Alberta. There is no need to consider whether these contracts are connected to the dispute against KPCL.</P>
<P>73. <BOLD><UNDER>The Hatch Contract</UNDER></BOLD>. The Statement of Claim does not allege that the Hatch Contract was made in Alberta, and to the extent that the evidence in this regard is unclear, CP has failed to discharge its onus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 18 [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, KPCL submits that it can be inferred from the evidence before the Court that any agreements between Hatch and CP were made outside of Alberta:
<P1>(a) there is no evidence or allegations as to where the Hatch Contract was made;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) all discussions with CP related to Hatch's proposal to perform work on the Project were with CP's Ontario office;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) CP's acceptance of Hatch's proposal was sent by CP from its Ontario office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 14, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Although the letter in evidence is not signed by Hatch, it may be inferred that it was executed by Hatch and the communication of the acceptance was sent by Hatch to CP's Ontario office;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(d) there is no evidence or allegations as to where the Amending Agreements to the Hatch Contract, were made.</P1></P>
<P>74. As CP has not met its burden of establishing that any contract it has with Hatch was made in Alberta, there is no need to consider whether any such contract is connected to the dispute against KPCL.</P>
<P>75. <BOLD><UNDER>The Clifton Contract</UNDER></BOLD>. There is no evidence or allegation in the Statement of Claim that the Clifton Contract was made in Alberta. On April 8, 2015, CP, through its Ontario office, communicated to Clifton that CP had selected Clifton to carry out geotechnical work on the Project<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and Clifton signed that letter in Saskatchewan and returned it to CP's Ontario office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The final Clifton Contract was executed by Clifton in Saskatchewan on April 16, 2015 and, on its face, was accepted by CP on April 30, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;. It appears that there is a typo in paragraph 15 of the Clifton Affidavit where it states that CP executed the Clifton Contract on April 15, 2015. This was corrected in the Affidavit of Wayne Clifton sworn March 28, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Second Clifton Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It can be inferred that CP's acceptance was then communicated to Clifton in Saskatchewan, as this agreement was later located in Clifton's files.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Clifton Affidavit, para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If there is any uncertainty as to whether final acceptance of the Clifton contract was communicated to Clifton in Saskatchewan, then CP has not discharged its onus.</P>
<P>76. Even if this Court finds that the Clifton Contract was made in Alberta, CP has failed to plead or otherwise provide any evidence that &lsquo;but for&rsquo; this contract, the events giving rise to the tort claims against KPCL would not have occurred. The tort claims against KPCL are limited to KPCL's work on the Project and its obtaining of insurance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 109&ndash;112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has not shown that the Clifton Contract led to or otherwise caused KPCL to conduct its work on the Project or obtain insurance. CP admits in its pleading that the reason KPCL was selected as the primary construction contractor for the Project, and subsequently entered into the KPCL Contract, was as a result of CP's request for proposal (RFP).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 98.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is clear from the pleadings that the factual cause of KPCL's work, and of its decision to obtain insurance, is the RFP process and the KPCL Contract itself.</P>
<P>77. Further, CP has not met its burden of showing that KPCL's conduct brought it within the scope of the Clifton Contract. There is no evidence or allegation that KPCL advised on, interfered with, or undertook any obligations in relation to the Clifton Contract. There is no mention of the Clifton Contract in those sections of the Statement of Claim which describe KPCL's alleged duties to CP, and the alleged breach of those duties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 106&ndash;112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is a clear indication that KPCL's allegedly tortious conduct did not involve bringing itself within the scope of the Clifton Contract.</P>
<P>78. <BOLD><UNDER>The Altus Contract</UNDER></BOLD>. Master Prowse found that the Altus Contract was made in Alberta and was connected to CP's negligence claim as against KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As noted, and with respect, there was no factual or legal basis for Master Prowse to make this determination.</P>
<P>79. The Altus Contract is not in evidence. There is no evidence, and no allegation in the Statement of Claim or in Altus' Statement of Defence, that indicates that the Altus Contract was made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 115; Altus Statement of Defence.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Altus is extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan, has a Regina office, and that the employees involved with the Project were all from this Regina office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 65 and Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has failed to discharge its onus of establishing that the Altus Contract was made in Alberta.</P>
<P>80. Even if the Altus Contract were somehow found to have been made in Alberta, CP has not established, or alleged in the Statement of Claim, that the Altus Contract is a necessary factual pre-condition to KPCL's alleged tortious conduct. As with the Clifton Contract discussed above, the evidence and pleadings suggest that KPCL's allegedly tortious conduct flows from the KPCL RFP and the KPCL Contract, not from the Altus Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 98.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>81. Further, CP has also not established, or alleged in its pleading, that KPCL's conduct brings it within in the scope of the Altus Contract. Although it is alleged that KPCL and Altus interacted as each performed their respective contractual duties, this alleged interaction does not mean that KPCL's conduct brought itself within the scope of Altus' contractual relationship as required by the test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada. Indeed, in the Altus Defence, Altus admits that it has no specific knowledge of KPCL's responsibilities and obligations, and at no point alleges any facts that would indicate that KPCL inserted itself with the scope of Altus contractual relationship with CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Altus Statement of Defence, para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no mention of the Altus Contract, or of Altus at all, in those sections of the Statement of Claim which describe KPCL's alleged duties to CP, and KPCL's alleged breach of those duties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 106&ndash;112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>82. <BOLD><UNDER>The Thurber-CP Contract</UNDER></BOLD>. There is no evidence, and no allegation in the Statement of Claim, that indicates that Thurber-CP Contract was made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 71; Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to Affidavit of Justin Meyer sworn March 12, 2018, pp 273&ndash;324.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In Thurber's Statement of Defence, Thurber has not pleaded any facts which indicate where the Thurber-CP Contract was made. Thurber is a British Columbia corporation, with a registered office in Victoria, British Columbia, is extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan, and maintains an office in Saskatoon.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Thurber's address for notice on the face of the Thurber-CP Contract is an address in Victoria, British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to Affidavit of Justin Meyer sworn March 12, 2018, pp 287.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has not met its onus of establishing that the Thurber-CP Contract was made in Alberta.</P>
<P>83. Even if the Thurber Contract were found to have been made in Alberta, Thurber denies in its pleading that any of its work on the Project was performed pursuant to the Thurber Contract. Thurber instead admits that all of its work on the Project was completed pursuant to the Thurber-Hatch Contract discussed below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber, para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has presented no evidence to contradict this assertion and did not contest it at the Hearing.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>July 5 Transcript.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>84. Further, and in any event, the uncontradicted evidence is that KPCL had no involvement at all, at any time, with Thurber.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 62.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The evidence is that any contractual relationship involving Thurber came to an end well in advance of KPCL signing the KPCL Agreement and becoming involved in any work on the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Statement of Defence, paras 13-14; Panteluk Affidavit, para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the Statement of Claim, there is no mention of Thurber having any interactions with KPCL, and specifically no mention of Thurber or any Thurber contract in those sections of the Statement of Claim which describe KPCL's alleged duties to CP, and KPCL's alleged breach of those duties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 106&ndash;112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In these circumstances, CP has not met its burden of showing that KPCL's allegedly tortious conduct factually flows from the Thurber-CP Contract, or that KPCL, through its conduct, somehow inserted itself into the Thurber-CP contractual relationship.</P>
<P>85. <BOLD><UNDER>The Thurber-Hatch Contract</UNDER></BOLD>. In its Statement of Claim, CP alleges that in or about December 2012, Hatch retained Thurber to provide geotechnical advice regarding engineering design for the Project, and to provide geological and geotechnical testing for the Project site.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In its Statement of Defence, Thurber admits that it entered into a contract with Hatch in relation to the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Statement of Defence, para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Neither CP's nor Thurber's pleading allege any facts which indicate where the Thurber-Hatch Contract was made.</P>
<P>86. CP has entered an exhibit to an affidavit sworn by a legal assistant employed by CP's counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>McArdle Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;11&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The relevant exhibit is a printout of an email between CP's counsel and Thurber's counsel, after which a bundle of correspondence and documents has been inserted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>McArdle Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;11&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At the Hearing, it was asserted by CP's counsel that this exhibit constituted the Thurber-Hatch Contract, and that certain addresses written at various places within this bundle of correspondence and documents established that the Thurber-Hatch Contract referred to in the Statement of Claim was made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>July 5 Transcript, pp 9, line 32-to pp 10 line 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>87. While an affidavit sworn by a legal assistant on the basis of information and belief may be acceptable for noncontroversial matters, it does not permit documents to be relied on for the truth of their contents on controversial matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tole v Lucki (Guardian ad litem of)</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 79</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 32</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Kingsway General Insurance Co v Fekete Construction Co</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 149</CITE><PARANUM>11 and 19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 33</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This bundle of correspondence and agreements exhibited to the McArdle Affidavit should be given no weight by this Court on the question of where the Thurber-Hatch Contract was made.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2002 ABCA 110</CITE><PARANUM>87</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 34</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>88. In any event, it is unclear whether in fact the last essential act of contract formation with respect to the Thurber-Hatch Contract actually took place in Alberta. As noted above, Thurber is a British Colombia corporation which also has an offices in Saskatoon. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with offices in Saskatchewan arid elsewhere around the world.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has not met its burden of establishing that the Thurber-Hatch Contract was made in Alberta.</P>
<P>89. Even if the Thurber-Hatch Contract was made in Alberta, CP has failed to establish or allege in the Statement of Claim facts that would indicate that this contract is connected to the dispute against KPCL. As discussed above with respect to the Thurber-CP Contract, based on the evidence and pleadings regarding the timing and extent of Thurber's involvement with the Project and with KPCL, CP has clearly not met its burden of establishing that KPCL's allegedly tortious conduct factually flows from a contract with Thurber, or that KPCL, through its conduct, somehow inserted itself into a contractual relationship between Thurber and Hatch.</P></BLOCK6></BLOCK5>

<P>90.

In identifying new presumptive factors, a court should look to connections that give rise to a relationship with the forum that is similar in nature to the ones which result from the listed factors. Relevant factors include: (a) similarity of the connecting factor with the recognized presumptive connecting factors; (b) treatment of the connecting factor in the case law; (c) treatment of the connecting factor in the statute law; and (d) treatment of the connecting factor in the private international law of other legal systems with a shared commitment to order, fairness and comity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 91 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The onus is CP if it relies on a new presumptive factor.</P>
<P>91.

<P>93. In this case only Altus and Intact were served in Alberta.</P>
<P>94. <EM>Van Breda</EM> supports the conclusion that there is no constitutional basis for the extension of jurisdiction over foreign defendants under <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(i) of the <EM>Rules</EM>. This factor was not identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as a presumptive factor. Further, it differs from the factors that were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as it is not based on a territorial connection between the claim against the foreign defendant and the jurisdiction of the Court.</P>
<P>95. As stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Van Breda CA</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Van Breda v Village Resorts Limited</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 84</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Van Breda CA</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 37</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, this factor has not gained general acceptance as a presumptive factor because, given the liberal rules for joinder of parties, this factor cannot be by itself a reliable indicator of a real and substantial connection of the subject matter of the Action to the proposed jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda CA</EM> at paras 74, 78-79 <BOLD>[Tab 37].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The rejection of this factor as a presumptive connecting factor has been accepted by other courts<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Best</EM> at para 25 [<BOLD>Tab 17</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Misyura v Walton</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5397</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 38</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and is consistent with other pre-<EM>Van Breda</EM> cases where the core of the claim was not connected to the domestic jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Muscutt</EM> [<BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Deuruneft Deutsche-Russishce Mineralol Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Bullen</SOC><CITE>2003 ABQB 743</CITE><PARANUM>87</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 39</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Lemmex v Bernard</SOC><CITE>[2002] OJ No 2131</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 40</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Gajraj v DeBernardo</SOC><CITE>[2002] OJ No 2130</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 41</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Paraie v Cangemi</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 6341</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 42</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is also consistent with the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's review of the model <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, in which it confirmed that the &ldquo;necessary and proper party rule&rdquo; as presumptive factor would be &ldquo;out of place in provisions that are based, not on service, but on substantive connections between the proceeding and the enacting jurisdiction...Territorial competence over the second defendant will not be presumed merely on the ground that the person is a necessary or proper party to the proceeding against the first person.

<P>96. Further, as acknowledged by CP at the Hearing, subsequent to <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the service <EM>ex juris</EM> rules in Ontario have been amended.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 17.02 [<BOLD>Tab 43</BOLD>]; July 5 Transcript, pp 24, line 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The relevant rule has been repealed, such that the necessary and proper party factor is &ldquo;no longer a valid basis to serve a party outside of Ontario,&rdquo; let alone providing a basis for the assumption of jurisdiction over a foreign defendant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corp.</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 604</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 44</BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The treatment of this proposed presumptive connecting factor in Canadian statute law therefore further supports the proposition that it should not be recognized by this Court.</P>
<P>97. Notwithstanding <EM>Van Breda</EM>, in Alberta there is a line of subsequent cases that have made comments, in <EM>obiter</EM>, that the necessary and proper party factor was sufficient to found substantive jurisdiction or was a presumptive connecting factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Turner</EM> at para 59 [<BOLD>Tab 36</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Geophysical Service Inc</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 45</BOLD>]; <EM>Toews</EM> at para 66 [<BOLD>Tab 30</BOLD>]. On appeal of <EM>Toews</EM> the Court of Queen's Bench found that it did not need to consider the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability or constitutionality of Rule 11.25(3)(i) because it had already established jurisdiction under one of the established presumptive connecting factors: <EM>Toews QB</EM> at para 49 [<BOLD>Tab 31</BOLD>]. The Court of Appeal also did not address this issue: <EM>Toews CA</EM> [<BOLD>Tab 31</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In each of these cases, the Court had established jurisdiction based on recognized presumptive connecting factors,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Turner</EM>, the Court had already found that the contracts in issue had been performed or breached in Alberta: at para 27 [Tab 36]; in <EM>Toews</EM>, the Court had already found that there were contracts made in Alberta that were connected with the alleged tort in dispute: at para 57 [<BOLD>Tab 31</BOLD>]; in <EM>Geophysical Service Inc</EM>, the Court also held that the alleged tort of conversion was committed in Alberta [<BOLD>Tab 45</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and so the <EM>obiter</EM> comments about the &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; factor are not binding on this Court. With respect, to the extent they are not consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, which is binding on this Court, they cannot be and should not be followed.</P>
<P>98. <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(i), if applied broadly, reaches beyond the legislative competence of the Province to extend the territorial limits of the Court's jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>This conclusion is unaffected by whether the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM> are substantive or procedural.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Rule conflates jurisdiction of the Court over a defendant that is obtained by way of presence-based jurisdiction, with the assumption of jurisdiction of the Court based on a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of the dispute and the forum. The fact that the Court may have jurisdiction over Altus by service in Alberta has little to do with whether there is a real and substantial connection between the forum and an action against KPCL. In this case, there is no real and substantial connection to Alberta and the use of Rule 11.25(3)(i) to found substantive jurisdiction over KPCL should be rejected.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(4)</EM></N><TI><EM>Any Presumptive Connecting Factors are Rebutted</EM></TI>
<P>99. As noted earlier, the presumption of jurisdiction that arises where a presumptive connecting factor is established is rebuttable. The burden of rebutting the presumption rests on the foreign defendant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 81 and 95 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The focus at the initial presumptive stage is to <EM>identify the existence</EM> of a connecting factor which fits within the common law requirements, while the focus at the rebuttal stage is to <EM>assess the strength</EM> of this connection.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Brown v Mar Taino SA</SOC><CITE>2015 NSSC 348</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Brown</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>] at para 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The ability to rebut the presumption of jurisdiction where there is only a weak relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum serves as an important check on jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 95 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 40 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The presumption may be rebutted where the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the litigation is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 43 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 81 and 97 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>100. In the Decision, the only presumptive connecting factor relied on by Master Prowse was the Altus Contract, even though it was not in evidence. <EM>Van Breda</EM> recognizes that rebutting the presumption may operate differently depending the presumptive connecting factor at issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 95 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A number of common factual elements found in other cases support the rebuttal of the presumption in this case:
<P1>(a) the foreign defendant is not only not a party to the domestic contract, but has no prior knowledge of, or control over, the domestic contract or where it was made;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cormier v Greyhound Canada Transportation ULC</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 5600</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Cormier</EM>] at para 17&ndash;19, and 27 [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>]; <EM>Brown</EM> at para 77 [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) the domestic contract contemplates contractual performance, either substantially or entirely, in the foreign defendant's home jurisdiction;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Cormier</EM> at para 19&ndash;21 [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>]; <EM>Brown</EM> at para 10-11 [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) the plaintiff suffered their injury in the jurisdiction of the foreign defendant, where the domestic contract was intended to be substantially or entirely performed;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Cormier</EM> at para 19 [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>]; <EM>Brown</EM> at para 85[<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(d) the foreign defendant has confined their activities to their home jurisdiction;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Cormier</EM> at para 27-28 [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>]; <EM>Brown</EM> at paras 13 and 85 [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(e) due to superseding contracts, common law factors or statutory regimes which arise in the foreign jurisdiction, the domestic contract will be of relatively limited relevance in determining tortious liability.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Cormier</EM> at para 24 [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>]; <EM>Brown</EM> at para 79&ndash;85 [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>101. KPCL submits that many of the above factors are present in this case. The only contract to which KPCL is a party was not made in Alberta, and there is no indication that KPCL had any prior or control over any of the other contractual relationships at issue. All of the contracts at issue in this Action contemplated performance either substantially or entirely in, or related to work in, Saskatchewan, which is where KPCL confined its activities and where CP suffered its alleged injury.</P>
<P>102. In these circumstances, any presumptive connecting factors are rebutted. It is not reasonable to expect that KPCL would be called to answer proceedings in Alberta.</P>
<P>103. In summary, CP has failed to discharge its onus to establish that this Honourable Court has jurisdiction over KCPL or the Action. The Court need not go any further and the Action should be stayed or dismissed.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Alberta Is <EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>General Principles</TI>
<P>104. Even if this Court has jurisdiction with respect to the Action, it is clear that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Saskatchewan is clearly a more appropriate forum to hear this dispute.</P>
<P>105. Finding that there is a real and substantial connection does not automatically mean that a court will or should assume jurisdiction over a claim. Once jurisdiction is established, the party contesting jurisdiction may raise the doctrine of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and attempt to &ldquo;show why the court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction and displace the forum chosen by the plaintiff&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 51 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 103 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>106. The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that a court of another jurisdiction has a real and substantial connection to the claim and that the alternative forum is clearly more appropriate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 52 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Breeden v Black</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 48</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While the normal state of affairs favours exercising jurisdiction in the forum where it is properly assumed, this should never come at the cost of one party facing unfair or clearly inefficient proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Courts must be mindful that jurisdiction may sometimes be established on a rather low threshold.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> One purpose of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is to temper any potential rigidity in the rules governing the assumption of jurisdiction, and to &ldquo;assure fairness to the parties&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>];</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Where the evidence indicates that the alternative forum is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation, a court should grant the stay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Finally, as Master Prowse noted in the Decision, where proceedings are extant in two jurisdictions, the issue of onus is less relevant in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 52&ndash;57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> To avoid either party obtaining a tactical advantage, the Court &ldquo;should simply determine which forum is likely more suitable.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 56-57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>107. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is fact specific and discretionary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Muscutt</EM> at para 42 [<BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A party applying for a stay may raise diverse facts, considerations and concerns, as the doctrine focuses on the contexts of individual cases.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 105 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court set out a list of non-exhaustive factors to consider in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Other courts have also considered other factors.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bidell Equipment LP v Caliber Midstream GP LLC</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 76</CITE><PARANUM>25 and 27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 49</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Dirtt Environmental Solutions Ltd v Almond</SOC><CITE>2010 ABQB 499</CITE><PARANUM>45</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 50</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, as noted by the Supreme Court of Canada, the question is, quite simply: &ldquo;Is there a more appropriate jurisdiction based on the relevant factors?&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Amchem Products Incorporated v British Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board)</SOC><CITE>1993 CarswellBC 47</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>Amchem</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 51</BOLD>] at para 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>Saskatchewan has a Real and Substantial Connection to the Action</TI>
<P>108. As noted above, the defendant seeking a stay based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> must establish that the alternative forum has a real and substantial connection to the claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, there is no doubt that there is a real and substantial connection with this claim and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In Saskatchewan <EM>The Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997, c C-41.1 (<EM>CJPTA</EM>) provides that Saskatchewan has territorial competence over a proceeding if, among other things, &ldquo;there is a real and substantial connection between Saskatchewan and the facts on which the proceeding against that person is based&rdquo; (s 9). [ <BOLD>Tab 52</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition to presence-based jurisdiction over KPCL and Clifton as Saskatchewan corporations, and all other parties because they carry on business in Saskatchewan and can be served there,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo; (KPCL); Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo; (CP); Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo; (Intact); Exhibit &ldquo;19&rdquo; (Clifton); Exhibit &ldquo;22&rdquo; (Hatch); Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo; (Thurber); Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo; (Altus).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and consent-based jurisdiction over KPCL, Hatch, Intact and Clifton (who all apply to have this Action stayed in favour of Saskatchewan), there are presumptive connecting factors in Saskatchewan. As noted, all parties carry on business in Saskatchewan, and the very core of the dispute relates to alleged torts committed in Saskatchewan and contracts made, performed or allegedly breached in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii.</N><TI>Saskatchewan is Clearly the More Appropriate Forum</TI>
<P>109. A review of relevant factors establishes that Saskatchewan is clearly the more appropriate forum, which will lead to the more fair and efficient resolution of the dispute.</P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(1)</EM></N><TI><EM>Location of Parties and Where they Carry on Business</EM></TI>
<P>110. There are seven parties to the Action. None of them are Alberta corporations. Altus is an Alberta registered limited partnership with its head office in Edmonton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP is a federal corporation with its head office in Alberta. The rest of the parties are federal corporations (Intact, Clifton),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 2; Clifton Affidavit, para 2, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a Saskatchewan corporation (KPCL), a British Columbia corporation (Thurber) and an Ontario corporation (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo;; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;21&rdquo;; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;24&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These corporations have their head offices outside of Alberta, namely in Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 9; Clifton Affidavit, para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> in British Columbia (Thurber)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>111. Not all of the parties to this Action have a business presence in Alberta. Notably, KPCL has no business presence or office in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On the other hand, all parties are registered in Saskatchewan,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo; (KPCL); Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo; (CP); Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo; (Intact); Exhibit &ldquo;19&rdquo; (C &ldquo;22&rdquo; (Hatch); Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo; (Thurber); Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo; (Altus).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carry on business in Saskatchewan, and the work related to the claims made in the Action was conducted in, or prepared for the Project in, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>112. Master Prowse correctly found that this factor favours Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 66.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(2)</EM></N><TI><EM>Location of the Witnesses</EM></TI>
<P>113. The location of witnesses who are likely to be the subject of document discovery, oral discovery, or who may testify at trial, overwhelmingly supports Saskatchewan as the most appropriate forum. Logistically, conducting the action in Alberta will be inefficient and cause significant travel and disruption to a much larger number of witnesses than having CP's claim dealt with in Saskatchewan.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>115. This evidence confirms that only 17 (24%) of the identified potential witnesses are resident in Alberta, and 40 (56%) are resident in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>116. If the Action proceeds in Alberta, the current evidence is that approximately 54 witnesses (76% of the identified witnesses) will have to travel to Alberta from Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Manitoba or Ontario. Clifton and KPCL are the most affected, with 26 witnesses that will have to travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta, including both of their senior management and employees. Their evidence of the significant harm this will cause them is unchallenged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 91; Clifton Affidavit, para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The significant impact on witnesses has been recognized as an important factor in numerous <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> cases.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 53 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>] the Supreme Court of Canada did not disturb the trial judge's finding that the inconvenience and expense to Israeli defendants to attend the trial in Ontario was a relevant factor. For example, see also: <CASEREF><SOC>Shinoff v BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 926</CITE><PARANUM>17&ndash;20</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 53</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Multiactive Software Inc v Advanced Service Solutions Inc</SOC><CITE>2003 BCSC 643</CITE><PARANUM>15 and 29</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Multiactive</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 54</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Sullivan v Four Seasons Hotels Limited</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 4622</CITE><PARANUM>55</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 55</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Churchill Cellars Ltd v Haider</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 2013</CITE><PARANUM>35&ndash;37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 56</BOLD>]; <EM>Royal QB</EM> at para 64 [<BOLD>Tab 16</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>117. If the Action proceeds in Saskatchewan, only 31 (44% of the identified witnesses) will have to travel from outside of Saskatchewan. Hatch has confirmed that it would be a relatively minor inconvenience for its witnesses to travel to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP carries on business across Canada<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and has offices in Saskatchewan and has not filed any evidence to suggest that it would be an undue inconvenience to CP for its witnesses to travel to Saskatchewan. In fact, CP has not filed any evidence regarding witnesses expected to be called at trial or their locations. This is a relevant factor to the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis and leaves the overwhelming evidence above uncontroverted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 70 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>118. The Alberta Court will have no jurisdiction over 54 (70% of the potential witnesses). If any witnesses are not cooperative, there is a greater chance that the Alberta Court will have to resort to more expensive and inefficient procedures to compel the testimony of out-of-province witnesses, through letters rogatory and the seeking of judicial assistance from the Saskatchewan and other courts. This risk is less in Saskatchewan where only 44% of the potential witnesses are out of the Province.</P>
<P>119. Master Prowse correctly found that this factor favours Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, paras 64-65.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(3)</EM></N><TI><EM>Location of Physical Evidence</EM></TI>
<P>120. The location of electronic records will not likely be an impediment to the claims made in the Action proceeding in Alberta or Saskatchewan. However, the evidence is that the real, physical evidence is primarily located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>121. All business records of KPCL, including physical files are located in Estevan, Saskatchewan and all documentary evidence held by KPCL relating to the claim is located and managed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has no business records with respect to the Project that are located in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> All of Clifton's records with respect to the Project are located in Regina.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The uncontroverted evidence is that many of the physical records of the other parties will be located in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>122. Further, the claim relates to lands which are located in Saskatchewan, and a foundation failure on those lands. Evidence relating to the lands will be located entirely in Saskatchewan (for example, soil core samples).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, if access or preservation of the real property evidence is required for the purposes of expert evidence, tests, observations or site visits as part of a trial, this will largely need to take place in Saskatchewan at the site of the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 81 and 82; Clifton Affidavit, para 25; Paton Affidavit, para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Alberta Court will not have jurisdiction to make <EM>in rem</EM> orders related to that evidence or property, and may need to go through the extra step of seeking the judicial assistance of the Saskatchewan courts. On the other hand, a Saskatchewan court will have territorial jurisdiction over the lands at issue and will be in a position to make orders providing access to, preservation of, or inspection of the Project lands.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Sask Gaz December 27, 2013, 2684, [<EM>The Court of Queen's Bench Rules</EM>], r 6-42 [<BOLD>Tab 57</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>123. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(4)</EM></N><TI><EM>Timely Resolution of the Dispute</EM></TI>
<P>124. Judicial resources should be allocated and expended with a view to making the litigation quicker, more economical and less complicated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 58 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In Alberta, a foundational rule, <EM>Rule</EM> 1.2(1), provides that the purpose of the rules is to &ldquo;provide a means by which claims can be fairly and justly resolved in or by a court process in a timely and cost-effective way&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 1.2(1) [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The rules are intended to be used to, among other things, &ldquo;facilitate the quickest means of resolving a claim at the least expense&rdquo; and to &ldquo;provide an effective, efficient, and credible system of remedies&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 1.2(2) [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Saskatchewan rules have similar provisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, r 1-3 [<BOLD>Tab 57</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL submits that, consistent with these principles, the courts in Alberta and Saskatchewan should work cooperatively and consistently to prompte the efficient resolution of the disputes related to the Project.</P>
<P>125. As a general principle, all parties prefer a timely and efficient resolution of disputes. In this case, however, KPCL and Intact have specifically provided evidence of the need to have timely resolution of CP's claim due to the impact of the claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 92; Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In particular, with respect to KPCL, CP is presently refusing to pay over $12 million admitted to be due and owing to KPCL for work KPCL performed on the Project, on the basis of an alleged set-off arising out of its claims in the Alberta Action,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;E&rdquo; KPCL Holdback Application.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and claims set-off for payment of this amount in the Statement of Claim in the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This directly affects KPCL's assets and cash flow, which in turn impacts its bonding capacity and ongoing operations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit para 92; Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;F&rdquo; Panteluk Saskatchewan Affidavit, para 64; Percy Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>126. The delay in the past few years in obtaining trial dates in Alberta has been recognized by the Alberta Court of Appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, for example <CASEREF><SOC>NEP Canada ULC v MEC Op LLC</SOC><CITE>2016 ABCA 201</CITE><PARANUM>1</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 58</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The evidence is that, as of February 2018, trials over 10 days were currently booking into 2021 in Alberta, and into 2019 in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 95. KPCL's counsel has recently confirmed that as of the date of this brief, trials over 10 days are in fact currently booking into 2022 in Alberta and into 2019 in Saskatchewan.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clearly, the parties are likely to achieve a significantly more timely resolution of the dispute in Saskatchewan. A stay of this Action in favour of Saskatchewan is consistent with Alberta's foundational rules.</P>
<P>127. Master Prowse correctly found that this factor significantly favours Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 67.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(5)</EM></N><TI><EM>Impact on Other Proceedings/Possibility of Conflicting Judgments</EM></TI>
<P>128. A multiplicity of proceedings, and the prospect of conflicting judgments, is to be avoided.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Attorney General) v Malik</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 59</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>129. The Saskatchewan Action and the KPCL Holdback Application are extant in Saskatchewan. The parties continue to wait for the Saskatchewan Court's decision on the CP Application, the Second CP Application and the KPCL Holdback Application.</P>
<P>130. This Action, and the Saskatchewan Proceedings, while they do not perfectly overlap and have unique features, arise out of the same Project and have overlapping issues. The Saskatchewan proceedings and the Alberta proceedings are also directly linked by CP through its claim, in the Alberta Action, of set-off against its obligation to pay the holdback that is the subject of the KPCL Holdback Application.</P>
<P>131. If the Alberta Action is permitted to proceed, it will create a multiplicity of proceedings and the risk of conflicting judgments, for at least the following reasons:
<P1>(a) only the Saskatchewan Court has jurisdiction to hear or grant relief pursuant to the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>, including the relief sought by KPCL in the KPCL Holdback Application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, sections 2(c), 7, 17, 38, 86&ndash;96 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Re Kerr Interior Systems Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2009 ABCA 240</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Kerr</EM>] at para 72&ndash;79 [<BOLD>Tab 60</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Alberta Court of Appeal has commented that resolving &ldquo;questions relating to the rights of lien holders under the [Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>] [is] a task more suitable to the Courts of Saskatchewan.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Kerr</EM>, at para 72 [<BOLD>Tab 60</BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is likely that if this Action proceeds, at a minimum the KPCL Holdback Application will remain outstanding;</P1>
<P1>(b) the assumption of jurisdiction by Alberta, while it will be relevant to the Saskatchewan Court, will not bind the Saskatchewan Court which may nonetheless assume jurisdiction and refuse to stay the Saskatchewan Proceedings, given the very strong connection between the dispute and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Teck Cominco Metals Ltd v Lloyd's Underwriters</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 11</CITE><PAGENUM>at 36&ndash;38</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 61</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Where Saskatchewan is so clearly the most appropriate forum, the risk that the Saskatchewan court exercises its jurisdiction is real.</P1></P>
<P>132. On the other hand, the potential for duplication and inconsistent results can be avoided by staying the Alberta Action and allowing CP to pursue its claims in the jurisdiction that has the most significant connection with the dispute, Saskatchewan. If the Alberta Action is stayed, under Saskatchewan law CP will likely be able to bring all of its claims, against both the Objecting Defendants and the Attorning Defendants, in Saskatchewan, even if no additional parties provide a Limitations Undertaking.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bergbusch Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>133. The only place that all issues between KCPL and CP can be resolved, and the efficient place for any issues between CP and the other Defendants in the Alberta Action to be resolved, is in Saskatchewan. As is discussed in detail below, this Court should stay the entire Action, as against all defendants, in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>134. This factor strongly favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(6)</EM></N><TI><EM>Costs / Prejudice</EM></TI>
<P>135. The Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or declining the stay, are relevant factors to consider in the determination of the most convenient forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 53 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>136. In this case, the costs and prejudice if the Alberta Action proceeds are significant. As set out earlier, there will be significant witness costs and inefficiencies; significant evidentiary inefficiencies and costs relating to physical records and the real evidence at the Project site; significant delay and its associated costs and prejudice; and the high probability of duplicative proceedings (and their associated costs)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 84.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> with the prospect of conflicting decisions.</P>
<P>137. In addition to these general costs, there will be significant prejudice to KPCL and Clifton. It will be unduly burdensome to their business to have their senior management out of the office for lengthy periods of time as they attend to the Alberta Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 90; Clifton Affidavit, para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL is a mid-sized, family run business, and CP's allegations are very serious and will potentially damage KPCL's future reputation and ability to generate new business.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 87.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such hardship to a smaller business is a relevant consideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Salus Marine Wear Inc v Queen Charlotte Lodge Ltd</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3063</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 62</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>138. CP is a large Canadian public railway company and its offices are located across Canada (which includes employee accommodations located in Moose Jaw and offices in Saskatchewan near the Project and in Regina).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 91; Clifton Affidavit, para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has filed no evidence of any prejudice to CP if the Alberta Action is stayed. The costs of litigation, given the locations of the witnesses and the evidence, would very likely be lower for all parties if the matter proceeds in Saskatchewan. There is no evidence of any harm or prejudice to any other parties if the Alberta Action is stayed.</P>
<P>139. It is obvious that any impact on CP, if the stay is granted, is minor compared to the impact on KPCL and Clifton specifically, and all of the parties generally, if the stay is not granted.</P>
<P>140. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(7)</EM></N><TI><EM>Problems Relating to Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</EM></TI>
<P>141. There are no anticipated issues regarding the recognition of a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts. KPCL has no presence or assets in Alberta to enforce against.</P>
<P>142. This factor is neutral.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(8)</EM></N><TI><EM>Location of Cause of Action and Damage</EM></TI>
<P>143. The Action relates to a foundation failure on a Project which was and is entirely located within the Province of Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, for example, <CASEREF><SOC>BC Rail Partnership v Standard Car Truck Co</SOC><CITE>2003 BCSC 150</CITE><PARANUM>51</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>BC Rail Partnership</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 63</BOLD>], where the Court relied on the location of a train-car derailment accident as an important factor supporting the exercise of jurisdiction.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The alleged negligence was committed in Saskatchewan (with the possible exception of the misrepresentation claims against Clifton which may have occurred in Ontario). Again, it is beyond doubt that the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by the respondent's activities or its consequences&rdquo; is Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 46 [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, the preponderance of evidence is that all of the implementation of the design work, the physical construction work, and the regular design and site meetings, all occurred in Saskatchewan, or on the phone with parties in Saskatchewan, such that any alleged breaches of contract occurred in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibits &ldquo;16&rdquo; and &ldquo;17&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>144. The damages CP claims all relate to the costs of investigating the failure in Saskatchewan, and the costs to redesign and reconstruct the Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>145. Master Prowse correctly found that this factor heavily favours Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 60&ndash;63.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>(9)</EM></N><TI><EM>Applicable Law</EM></TI>
<P>146.

<BLOCK5><N><EM>(10)</EM></N><TI><EM>Parties' Choice or Preferred Forum</EM></TI>
<P>148. <BOLD><UNDER>KPCL Prefers Saskatchewan</UNDER></BOLD>. KPCL was the first party to choose a forum for a dispute related to the Project, when it filed the Saskatchewan Action first-in-time, in August 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 70.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While this factor has been given some weight,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 68</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Colonial Countertops Ltd v Maple Terrazzo Marble &amp; Tile Incorporated</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 752</CITE><PARANUM>75-76</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 69</BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL acknowledges that the first-to-file is not a strong factor, by itself, in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis.</P>
<P>149. <BOLD><UNDER>CP Prefers Alberta</UNDER></BOLD>. CP chose to file the Action in Alberta, four months after KPCL filed the Saskatchewan Action. CP's choice of forum should be given little weight. First, as noted earlier, the plaintiff's choice of forum should never come at the cost of one party facing unfair or clearly inefficient proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, it is KPCL's position that CP has also attorned to the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan courts through the filing of the CP Application and the Second CP Application, both of which invoked the inherent jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court and sought a remedy from the Saskatchewan Court other than challenging the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lindblom v Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>2001 ABCA 102</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 70</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Bedard v Bedard</SOC><CITE>2004 SKCA 101</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 71</BOLD>]; Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;, Notice of Application of CP filed February 28, 2018, para 1, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;, Notice of Application of CP filed March 13, 2018, paras 1&ndash;6. The parties await the decision of the Saskatchewan Court on this issue.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Third, as will be discussed further below, CP structured its affairs in its contracts with Thurber, Hatch and Clifton so as to attempt to provide itself a contractual option to engage in forum shopping&mdash;attempting to bind its counterparties to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts but &ldquo;without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Affidavit of Justin Meyer dated March 12, 2018, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;; Notice to XXXXXXXXXX CP, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Affidavit of Justin Meyer dated March 12, 2018, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Forum shopping is not to be encouraged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Amchem</EM> at para 26 and 37 [<BOLD>Tab 51</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP could have commenced its claim in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>150. <BOLD><UNDER>Intact Prefers Saskatchewan</UNDER></BOLD>. Intact, like KPCL, is not fettered by a choice of forum clause, and supports the stay of the Alberta Action in favour of Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Application.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>151. <BOLD><UNDER>Hatch and Clifton Prefer Saskatchewan</UNDER></BOLD>. Hatch and Clifton both prefer that the Action be stayed in favour of Saskatchewan. CP relies on the &ldquo;Governing Law&rdquo; clauses in the Clifton Contract and the Hatch Contract, which respectively provide:
<QUOTE><P>26. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. <UNDER>The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.</UNDER> The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. <UNDER>The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta</UNDER>, <UNDER>without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction</UNDER>. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>152. With respect, these provisions should be given little, if any, weight, in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis for a number of reasons. First, in order for a forum selection clause to be binding on the parties, the clause &ldquo;must be mandatory and must clearly and precisely confer exclusive jurisdiction on the foreign authority&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>GreCon Dimter Inc. v JR Normand Inc</SOC><CITE>[2005] 2 SCR 401</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 72</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses have &ldquo;lesser strength&rdquo; than exclusive attornment clauses and do not need to be deferred to.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>BC Rail Partnership</EM> at para 27 [<BOLD>Tab 63</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Romanchuk v Jemi Fibre Corp</SOC><CITE>2018 SKQB 46</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Romanchuk</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 73</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here, the Hatch clause is non-exclusive. Further, given that CP reserved the right to take proceedings outside of Alberta, the Clifton clause should also be interpreted to be non-exclusive. This Court should not consider these clauses binding.</P>
<P>153. Even if the Clifton clause is exclusive, this Court is not obligated to enforce it. First, the Court must determine whether the forum selection clause is enforceable and applies to the circumstances; and second, the Court must assess whether there is strong cause in favour of denying a stay, despite the enforceable forum selection clause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>[2003] 1 SCR 450</CITE><PAGENUM>at 462</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 74</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Douez v Facebook Inc</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 33</CITE><PARANUM>126</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Douez</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 75</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no set list of factors for a court to consider as part of assessing &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; and a court must consider &ldquo;all of the circumstances&rdquo; in this part of the test.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Douez</EM> at para 30 [<BOLD>Tab 75</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>154. In this case, the forum clause does not apply to tort claims, so, at best it only partially applies. Further, even if the clauses apply, when there are non-signatories involved in a claim involving a forum selection clause, it can be a factor for the second part of the test and constitutes a &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce. The fair treatment of a group of litigants, some of whom are signatories to a choice of forum contract and some of whom are non-signatories may be an exceptional circumstance requiring that a contractual choice be overridden.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1400467 Alberta Ltd v Adderley</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 339</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 76</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Aldo Group Inc v Moneris Solutions Corporation</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 725</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Aldo</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 77</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Chateau Des Charmes Wines Ltd v Sabate, USA Inc</SOC><CITE>[2005] OJ No 4604</CITE><PARANUM>28 and 43</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 78</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Skyway Canada Ltd v Clara Industrial Services Ltd</SOC><CITE>2005 CanLII 42253</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 24 [<BOLD>Tab 79</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is particularly so if it is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Magill v Expedia Canada Corporation</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 5247</CITE><PARANUM>55</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 80</BOLD>]; <EM>Yara Belle</EM> at para 79&ndash;83 [<BOLD>Tab 67</BOLD>]; See, for example: <CASEREF><SOC>Emkay Canada Fleet Services Corp v Imperial Oil</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 2710</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 81</BOLD>] where the Court refused to sever the applicant from a multi-party proceeding, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had a forum selection clause stipulating Alberta.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or where it would result in &ldquo;significantly less inconvenience to potential witnesses&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Multiactive</EM> at para 29 [<BOLD>Tab 54</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>155. KPCL and Intact do not have contracts with forum selection clauses. Even if the clauses in the Hatch, Clifton and Thurber contracts apply in any way, they should not be enforced by this Court as a ground to refuse to stay the Action, due to the risk of a multiplicity of proceedings, the impact on witnesses, the substantial connection of the claim to Saskatchewan, fairness between the parties, the interests of justice, and the public policy against forum shopping.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Romanchuk</EM> at para 34 [<BOLD>Tab 73</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Master Prowse's Decision is consistent with KPCL's position.</P>
<P>156. <BOLD><UNDER>Thurber and Altus</UNDER></BOLD><BOLD>.</BOLD> Thurber and Altus' preference as to forum is unknown. While they have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court, this does not necessarily mean that they object to the staying of the Action in favour of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>157. Four of the seven parties to this Action favour Saskatchewan. Only CP actively asserts that this Court should assume jurisdiction.</P>
<P>158. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iv.</N><TI>Juridical Advantage</TI>
<P>159. The loss of juridical advantage within the Canadian federation should not be given undue weight.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 112 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, other than what has already been addressed above, KPCL does not assert a juridical advantage or disadvantage in either jurisdiction.</P>
<P>160. CP's assertion that potential limitations issues in Saskatchewan create a juridical disadvantage for CP is misguided. Before considering whether limitations issues are relevant to juridical advantage this Court must ask &ldquo;whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff not to have commenced proceedings within the limitation period in the alternative forum... [...] A plaintiff who does not recognize an obvious <EM>forum conveniens</EM> and start proceedings there, even if only to guard against the running of the time bar, runs the risk of the court in the chosen forum concluding that he or she did not act reasonably and therefore staying the proceedings.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fernandes v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp.</SOC><CITE>2017 MBCA 96</CITE><PARANUM>50&ndash;52</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 82</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The connection between Saskatchewan and the subject matter and the claim is obvious. CP has not explained its delay in commencing proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fernandes</EM> at para 58&ndash;60 [<BOLD>Tab 82</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>161. In any event, under Saskatchewan law, if this Action is stayed, CP will likely be able to bring all of its claims, against both the Objecting Defendants and the Attorning Defendants, in Saskatchewan, even if no additional parties provide a Limitations Undertaking.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bergbusch Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>162. Further, KPCL submits that if this Court is concerned about staying the Action because of limitations issues that might arise if CP must bring its claims Saskatchewan, this Court has the jurisdiction to request that the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench accept a transfer of the Action from Alberta. This relief was also accepted as viable and proposed as alternative relief by CP in its Hearing Brief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Hearing Brief at pp 39, para 164 [<BOLD>Appendix A</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>163. In the Decision, Master Prowse indicated that a transfer of the Action to Saskatchewan would have been appropriate, but given the lack of Alberta legislation analogous to <EM>CJPTA</EM>, such a transfer could not be ordered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 73.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL submits that while an Alberta court cannot <UNDER>order</UNDER> a transfer to another jurisdiction,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cincurak v.

<P>168. In these circumstances, it would clearly be more fair and efficient for the dispute to be dealt with in Saskatchewan. It is therefore appropriate to stay the Action in favor of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>vii.</N><TI>A Stay Should be Granted Against All Claims in the Alberta Action</TI>
<P>169. In the Decision, Master Prowse correctly found that Saskatchewan was a more appropriate forum for hearing the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Master Prowse also correctly recognized that &ldquo;the worst possible outcome&rdquo; would be &ldquo;concurrent litigation in both provinces, with attendant wasted costs and possible inconsistent verdicts.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Master Prowse correctly assessed the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> factors holistically, taking into account the interests of all of the parties, including the Attorning Defendants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 61.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, Master Prowse ultimately stayed the Action only as against the Objecting Defendants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 75.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Regrettably, this decision may have the effect of creating what Master Prowse called the &ldquo;worst possible outcome&rdquo;. If the status quo stands, there is a serious risk that there will be concurrent litigation in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>170. KPCL submits that Master Prowse erred in staying the Action only as against the Objecting Defendants. If this Court determines that this dispute should be heard in Saskatchewan, then it has the jurisdiction and, pursuant to the relevant principles, should stay the Action as against both the Attorning Defendant and the Objecting Defendants, in favour of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>171. In contrast to assumed jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter, forum non conveniens</EM> is not concerned with the constitutional power of a court to reach beyond its territorial limits to affect the rights of individual foreign defendants. As a result, the Court is not limited to looking at looking at the individual interests of the party contesting jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 52 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is concerned partly with ensuring fairness to all of the parties involved, and partly with ensuring &ldquo;efficiency and convenience for the proceedings themselves.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at par 52 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>172. This concern with ensuring both fairness and efficiency within proceedings accords with the underlying jurisdictional authority to stay proceedings on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. This authority is rooted in this Court's inherent jurisdiction as a superior court to control its own process and prevent a multiplicity of proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Ltd. v.

Pursuant to the Court's broad jurisdiction to control its own process, the Court retains the discretion to make an order that the litigation is more appropriately resolved in an alternative forum even where some parties have attorned.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Norex</EM> at para 89 [<BOLD>Tab 90</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, &ldquo;choice of the appropriate forum is designed to ensure that the <UNDER>action</UNDER> is tried in the jurisdiction that has the closest connection with the <UNDER>action</UNDER> and the <UNDER>parties.</UNDER> All factors pertinent to making this determination must be considered.&rdquo; [Emphasis added]<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Frymer v.

<P>174. As such, provided that the claims against the Defendants are not properly severable, the Court should assess <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> considerations holistically, incorporating the interests of all parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, <EM>Lapointe</EM> at paras 55&ndash;60 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supreme Court of Canada recently emphasized &ldquo;the importance of having claims finally resolved in one jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 56 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>], citing <CASEREF><SOC>Parsons v.

(3d) 321</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, it means the disputes here should be dealt with in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>175. Alternatively, if this Court endorses Master Prowse's Decision to stay the Action on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> only as against the Objecting Defendants, KPCL requests that this Court specifically order that the Notices to Co-Defendant are also necessarily stayed. A notice to co-defendant is nothing more than a claim for contribution and indemnity. It is a precondition of the right to resort to contribution that there be liability to the plaintiff.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Stetar v Poirier</SOC><CITE>[1975] 2 SCR. 884</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>1974 CarswellAlta 131</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Stetar</EM>], at paras 28&ndash;31 [<BOLD>Tab 94</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is because the <EM>Tort-feasers Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Tort-feasers Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c. T-5, at s.3 [<BOLD>Tab 95</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> only provides for contribution where the co-defendant receiving the notice is &ldquo;liable in respect of the same damage&rdquo; as the co-defendant issuing the notice. The &ldquo;damage&rdquo; referred to can only have been suffered by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>176. If this Court stays the Action as against KPCL on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, it has determined that Saskatchewan is the only appropriate forum to determine KPCL's liability to CP. As the Notices to Co-Defendant involve determining KPCL's liability to CP, KPCL submits they have also been stayed by the Decision. If this were not so, then KPCL's liability to CP would still be at issue in Alberta, notwithstanding this Court's determination that Alberta is not the appropriate forum to determine this liability.</P>
<P>177. Master Prowse did not explicitly stay the Notices to Co-Defendant. If this Court adopts the piecemeal approach to <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> endorsed by Master Prowse, KPCL submits that it should clearly identify that the Notices to Co-Defendant have also been stayed.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. RELIEF REQUESTED</TI>
<P>178. KPCL seeks the following relief:
<P1>(a) An order setting aside the Statement of Claim of CP as against KPCL for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>(b) Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying and, if necessary, requesting a transfer of this Action in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(c) In the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying this Action and any Notice to Co-Defendant filed therein as against KPCL;</P1>
<P1>(d) Costs of this application; and</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>INTRODUCTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Clifton submits this Brief pursuant to rule 6.14(5)(c) of the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> as further written argument on its appeal of the Order of Master Prowse. Clifton also relies on its Brief filed on June 15, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Original Clifton Brief</EM>&rdquo;). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Brief shall have the definitions given in the Original Clifton Brief.</P>
<P>2. Clifton agrees with the Learned Master's conclusion that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> but objects to the remedy granted by him. Staying this action only as against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch, and Intact, and not as against Thurber and Altus as the Learned Master did, inevitably leads to identical issues being litigated concurrently in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. Presumably therefore, the same or very similar evidence will be led on behalf of any one party to deal with those issues. Since there is no joinder of issues and neither Court is bound by the findings of the other, it is possible that different factual findings could be made, and different conclusions drawn, on the same evidence.</P>
<P>3. The consequential effect of upholding the Learned Master's decision is thus inefficient litigation in both jurisdictions that creates a genuine possibility of inconsistent findings and verdicts regardless of the consistency of the evidence. This would seem to be an unintended result of the partial stay ordered by the Learned Master which this Honourable Court can properly avoid by allowing Clifton's appeal and either staying the action in its entirety in Alberta or transferring these proceedings to Saskatchewan. For the reasons that follow, it is Clifton's position that this Honourable Court has jurisdiction to make either Order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>ISSUE</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. The issue addressed in this Brief of Law is whether it was appropriate for the Learned Master to grant only a partial stay, as opposed to staying the entire action or making an Order requesting that it be transferred in its entirety to Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>LAW AND ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The Learned Master concluded that &ldquo;Saskatchewan is clearly more appropriate as the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,165 (Reasons for Judgment at para 72).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nonetheless, he ruled that he was not &ldquo;...able to transfer this action to Saskatchewan...&rdquo; because Alberta has not enacted the Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act (the &ldquo;<EM>Uniform CJPTA</EM>&rdquo;). He did not consider or analyze if there was another basis on which to transfer the proceedings. His failure to do so resulted in his determination that he was &ldquo;...limited to staying the Alberta action so that CP can commence similar proceedings in Saskatchewan...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,165 (Reasons for Judgment at paras 73, 74).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Learned Master then &ldquo;...order[ed] the CP action to be stayed <UNDER>against the four objecting defendants</UNDER>...&rdquo;&mdash;but not against Thurber and Altus, the Defendants who did not apply for a stay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,165 (Reasons for Judgment at para 75) [emphasis added<BOLD>].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The result is a partial stay of this action.</P>
<P>6. It is Clifton's position that a stay of the entire action in Alberta is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Alternatively, should this Honourable Court determine that relief to be unsuitable, then it has jurisdiction to transfer this matter in its entirety to Saskatchewan and an Order to that effect should be made.</P>
<P>7. CP's claims against each of the Defendants all raise one fundamental question: Who is responsible for the Foundation Failure? This fundamental question gives rise to many common sub-issues, all of which essentially require similar findings of fact to be made. For example, CP alleges that the equipment used to monitor soil conditions was improperly installed by Clifton, KPCL, Altus, and Thurber, all of whom it further alleges were responsible for ensuring proper installation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim at paras 40, 46, 75(j), 89(i)(iii) and (viii), 109(e), 117.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These Defendants dispute CP's allegations. Whether in Saskatchewan or Alberta, each of the parties will presumably advance the same evidence to prove their case. Both the Saskatchewan and Alberta Courts will be required to make certain findings of fact to determine whose position should be accepted on a balance of probabilities.</P>
<P>8. If the partial stay stands, the question of whether the monitoring equipment was properly installed will be litigated in Alberta between CP, Altus, and Thurber. It will also be litigated in Saskatchewan between CP, KPCL, and Clifton. The cost and time associated with this duplicative litigation results in an extremely inefficient use of the resources of the Courts in both jurisdictions and the parties. It also creates the distinct possibility that different factual findings will be made, thereby potentially leading to inconsistent decisions as to liability even though the evidence led will in all likelihood be virtually identical. Accordingly, the partial stay is an undesirable result for all of the parties and the Alberta and Saskatchewan Courts since the same, or extremely similar, issues will be concurrently dealt with at trial in two jurisdictions. This same situation will be the outcome with respect to any subsequent appeals. The inefficiency and redundancy created by the partial stay is thus readily apparent.</P>
<P>9. Further, the Defendants will likely become involved in both the Alberta and Saskatchewan proceedings through contribution and indemnity claims. Thurber and Altus have already filed Notices to Co-Defendants in this action, thereby indicating their intention to claim contribution and indemnity from the other Defendants. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that, if the partial stay remains, third party claims will probably be filed in Alberta, thus drawing KPCL, Clifton, Hatch, and Intact back into the Alberta proceedings. Likewise, it is possible that third party claims would be issued in Saskatchewan, thereby drawing Thurber and Altus into those proceedings. Consequently, most or all of the parties will end up simultaneously litigating the same issues in Alberta and Saskatchewan, thus compounding the inefficiency and likelihood of inconsistent findings and results.</P>
<P>10. In the circumstances, the only way to prevent duplication of proceedings is to have CP's claims against all parties adjudicated in one forum. For the reasons given in the Original Clifton Brief and the Learned Master's Reasons for Judgment at paras. 58 to 72,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,163 to 1,165 (Reasons for Judgment at paras 58 to 72).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Saskatchewan is clearly the more appropriate forum. Consequently, all of CP's claims should be litigated in that jurisdiction. The fact that Thurber and Altus did not apply for a stay does not prevent this Honourable Court from effecting that result. For the reasons given below, this Honourable Court has jurisdiction to grant a stay of the whole action or transfer it to Saskatchewan.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Stay of the Whole Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. As a threshold matter, it is important to note that the fact that Thurber and Altus did not apply for a stay of CP's claims against them is not a procedural bar to granting that relief. The Alberta Court of Appeal has held that, pursuant to s. 8 of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, s 8 <BOLD>{Tab B}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and rule 1.3(2) of the <EM>Rules of Court</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 1.3(2) <BOLD>{Tab C}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the fact that a party has not requested certain relief does not prevent masters and judges from granting it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Pyrrha Design Inc v Plum and Posey Inc</SOC><CITE>2016 ABCA 12 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>8&ndash;10, 17</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Pyrrha</EM>] <BOLD>{Tab 4}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Moreover, this Honourable Court has jurisdiction to grant a stay of an entire action regardless of whether all the defendants want it. Pursuant to s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, s 18(2) <BOLD>{Tab B}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> this Honourable Court may grant any breadth of stay that is just in the circumstances:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(2)</N><TI>Restraint by prohibition, injunction</TI><SSECP>Nothing in subsection (1) disables the Court from directing, if it thinks fit, a stay of proceedings in a proceeding pending before it, and any person, whether a party or not to any proceeding at any time pending in the Court

<UNDER>may apply to the Court for a stay of proceedings in the proceeding either generally or so far as might be necessary for the purposes of justice, and the Court shall on that application make any order that will be just</UNDER> [emphasis added].</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>13. There do not appear to be any reported decisions interpreting s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> in a case where some, but not all, defendants applied for a stay on jurisdictional grounds. There are cases involving an analogous situation: an application to stay litigation pending arbitration where some or all of the parties to the litigation were not parties to the arbitration (i.e.&mdash;third party proceedings). The Alberta Court of Appeal has held that s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, in &ldquo;combination&rdquo; with s. 7 of the <EM>Arbitration Act</EM> &ldquo;...and the court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own process to avoid unnecessary and duplicitous proceedings...&rdquo;, gives the Court jurisdiction to stay third party proceedings pending arbitration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Yaworski v Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP</SOC><CITE>2013 ABCA 21 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Yaworski</EM>] <BOLD>{Tab 6}</BOLD>, and <CASEREF><SOC>UCANU Manufacturing Corp v Calgary (City)</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 22 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>UCANU</EM>] <BOLD>{Tab 5}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. A good example of the use of the Court's power pursuant to s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> to stay third party proceedings pending arbitration is found in <EM>Macdonald</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Macdonald v Burke</SOC><CITE>2018 ABQB0 534 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Macdonald</EM>] <BOLD>{Tab 2}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In that case, three of the five defendants applied for a stay based on a mandatory arbitration clause or, in the alternative, the Alberta Court lacking jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> or being <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. The two non-applicant defendants (referred to in the decision as the &ldquo;TransCanada Defendants&rdquo;) took the position that, if the plaintiffs' claims against the applicant defendants were stayed pending arbitration, the plaintiffs' claim against the TransCanada Defendants should nevertheless proceed in court. Justice Tilleman stayed the plaintiffs' claims against the applicant defendants pending arbitration. Against the wishes of the TransCanada Defendants, Justice Tilleman &ldquo;...exercise[d] [his] discretion to stay the TransCanada matter pending the arbitration...&rdquo; because there were &ldquo;...overlapping facts (which are in contention) and overlapping issues...&rdquo; between the plaintiffs' claim against the applicant defendants and the plaintiffs' claim against the TransCanada Defendants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Macdonald</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 11 at paras 54-55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Caselaw from other jurisdictions also establishes that the Court's power to stay an entire proceeding is not limited to cases involving arbitration clauses. Superior courts have jurisdiction to stay entire proceedings on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> even if some of the defendants do not join in or oppose the stay application. For example, in <EM>Currie</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Currie v Farr's Coach Lines Ltd</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 2352 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Currie</EM>] <BOLD>{Tab 1}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> two of seven defendants applied to stay the Ontario-based action for lack of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> or <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Two of the defendants wanted the litigation to proceed in Ontario; the remaining three took no position. Justice Garson found that the Ontario Superior Court had jurisdiction, but Ontario was a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, largely because parallel proceedings were underway in New York.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the result, Justice Garson stayed the action against all defendants, including those who wanted the litigation against them to proceed in Ontario.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 62.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Justice Garson's approach in <EM>Currie</EM> was sound and avoids the exorbitant cost, time, and inefficiency associated with parallel actions in different jurisdictions. The approach also circumvents the potential for inconsistent findings of fact and verdicts based on those findings that may flow from the Learned Master's decision to grant only a partial stay in this case. For these reasons and others, the decision in <EM>Currie</EM> promotes the proper administration of justice in the circumstances of this case and, hence, should be followed by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>17. Policy considerations are also germane; a superior court must have jurisdiction to stay an entire action even if one or more defendants has not joined in or opposes the stay application. If it is otherwise, the inaction or opposition of a single defendant could effectively force a superior court to either: (a) decline to issue any stay and hear a matter despite possibly being a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> or lacking jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in respect of some or all of the defendants; or (b) issue a partial stay that may create duplicative proceedings.</P>
<P>18. In considering a stay application, therefore, the relief to be granted should not depend on whether all of the defendants applied for a stay. Rather, even in circumstances where they have not, the court's decision should be governed by determining whether the court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over each of the defendants, it is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> for each of the defendants, and it would be appropriate to divide the litigation between two or more forums. Obviously, where these factors give rise to competing interests as between parties, a balancing of those interests is required. The court's decision, however, must not be restricted to merely deliberating and deciding the positions of the parties making/opposing the application. Instead, the totality of the case must be examined so that the relief ultimately granted promotes and attempts to achieve the most efficient and proper administration of justice.</P>
<P>19. Where, as in this case, the court lacks jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> or is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in respect of some defendants <UNDER>and</UNDER> a partial stay will create duplicative proceedings, the court should not be forced to deny appropriate relief, namely a stay of the whole action, merely because some of the defendants do not make or oppose the application. Where just, this Honourable Court has the ability pursuant to s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> to stay the entire action, as was done in <EM>Currie</EM>. Given the Learned Master's decision that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> for four of the six Defendants and it would be inefficient and inappropriate to divide the litigation between Alberta and Saskatchewan, the just result would have been, and should be, a stay of the entire action. If that relief is granted, and assuming CP brings Thurber and Altus in, these parties cannot legitimately complain about being forced to litigate the issues between them involving a Saskatchewan project.</P>
<P>20. This Honourable Court has the inherent jurisdiction to control its own process, as well as jurisdiction under s. 18(2) of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> to grant a stay of an entire action if necessary for the purposes of justice. Clifton respectfully requests, therefore, that this Honourable Court use that jurisdiction to stay this entire action to prevent the parties from being compelled to litigate the same claims in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Transfer to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. Alternatively, should this Honourable Court determine that a stay of the entire Alberta action is not appropriate, is not left with deciding that only a partial stay can be granted, as Master Prowse did. If both the transferring (Alberta) and receiving (Saskatchewan) courts have the power to move proceedings as between them, whether as a result of enactment of the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM> or otherwise, then there does not appear to be any inherent prohibition against making an Order to that effect. In determining that he was limited to ordering a partial stay because Alberta has not enacted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM>, however, Master Prowse failed to consider whether this Honourable Court has jurisdiction otherwise to order that these proceedings be transferred.</P>
<P>22. Being a jurisdiction that has enacted its own <EM>CJPTA</EM>, Saskatchewan clearly has jurisdiction to accept a transfer. On review of that legislation, it is clear that this Honourable Court need only issue an Order requesting a transfer to Saskatchewan to effect that result. The parties would then file this Honourable Court's Order at the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench, and that Court would decide whether to accept the transfer. The relevant provision of Saskatchewan's <EM>CJPTA</EM> states as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>15.</N><TI>Court's discretion to accept or refuse a transfer</TI><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP><UNDER>After the filing of a request made by a court outside Saskatchewan to transfer to the Court of Queen's Bench a proceeding brought against a person in the transferring court, the Court of Queen's Bench may, by order</UNDER>:
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>accept the transfer, subject to subsection (4), if both of the following requirements are fulfilled:
<SPARA><N>(i)</N><SPARAP>either the Court of Queen's Bench or the transferring court has territorial competence in the proceeding;</SPARAP></SPARA>
<SPARA><N>(ii)</N><SPARAP>the Court of Queen's Bench has subject-matter competence in the proceeding; or</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>refuse to accept the transfer for any reason that the Court of Queen's Bench considers just, regardless of the fulfilment of the requirements of clause (a).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Saskatchewan <EM>CJPTA</EM>, s 15(1) <BOLD>{Tab A}</BOLD> [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>23. Pursuant to s. 15(2) of the <EM>CJPTA</EM>, the Saskatchewan Court must give reasons for any Order made pursuant to s. 15(1)(b) refusing to accept a transfer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Saskatchewan <EM>CJPTA</EM>, s 15(2) <BOLD>{Tab A}</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Notwithstanding this legislative requirement, there do not appear to be any reported decisions making such an Order. Given a transferring court's undoubtedly careful and considered examination of the jurisdictional issues preceding a transfer Order, it seems unlikely that the Saskatchewan Court would refuse to accept proceedings in the ordinary course (which may explain the absence of caselaw). In this case, the requirements for accepting a transfer exist; therefore, it seems even more improbable that the Saskatchewan Court would not accept an Order of this Honourable Court transferring the proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>If refused, though, the proceedings could still continue in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. This Honourable Court may include in its order a provision like the one the British Columbia Superior Court included in a transfer request order in <CASEREF><SOC>O'Connor v Chapman</SOC><CITE>2007 BCSC 657</CITE></CASEREF> [O'Connor] <BOLD>{Tab 3}</BOLD>: &ldquo;In the event the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary, does not accept the transfer, the proceedings will continue in this court&rdquo; (para 14).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Notwithstanding Saskatchewan legislation that would appear to seamlessly allow for a transfer of these proceedings, the Learned Master concluded that he was unable to make an Order because Alberta has not enacted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP's Record of Proceedings at p 1,165 (Reasons for Judgment at para 73).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In arriving at his decision, Master Prowse did not consider whether there was a basis on which the Order could be made notwithstanding the absence of specific legislation allowing for it. He simply concluded that it could not be done because Alberta had not enacted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM>. Clifton disagrees with this decision for the reasons that follow.</P>
<P>25. The crux of the issue that needed to be examined by Master Prowse is whether a court in a jurisdiction that has not adopted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM> (Alberta) has the ability to initiate a transfer to a court in a jurisdiction that has (Saskatchewan). Obviously, not even a superior court can do what it does not have jurisdiction to do. In the absence of enactment of the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM>, therefore, this Honourable Court's ability to order a transfer of proceedings must be found elsewhere.</P>
<P>26. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of caselaw about the basis, if any, on which transfers of proceedings can be achieved from a jurisdiction that has not enacted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM> to one that has. The lack of jurisprudence is noted by the learned authors in <EM>Statutory Jurisdiction: An Analysis of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Vaughan Black, Stephen G. A. Pitel, and Michael Sobkin, <EM>Statutory Jurisdiction: An Analysis of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> (Toronto: Carswell, 2012) at 239 <BOLD>[Tab D]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In considering whether such transfers can occur, the authors cite two cases with opposite conclusions: Newfoundland says &ldquo;no&rdquo;; Ontario says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at 239, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Hughes v Porter</SOC><CITE>2011 NLTD 106 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Pope &amp; Talbot Ltd. (Re)</SOC><CITE>2009 BCSC 1014 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>. This latter decision explains that the Ontario Court transferred the proceeding to it under British Columbia's <EM>CJPTA</EM>. The referenced Ontario decision does not appear to have been reported.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Notwithstanding these divergent approaches, the authors conclude that there seems to be no barrier to a court, in a jurisdiction that has not adopted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM>, initiating a transfer and state:
<QUOTE><P>Nevertheless, while it seems clear that purely statutory courts, such as small claims courts, lack the ability to initiate cross-border transfers of proceedings, <UNDER>it is not obvious why the inherent power of the superior courts should not include that authority</UNDER>. It is that jurisdiction that grounds a court's power to issue a stay on grounds of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and issuing a transfer request may be seen as no more than a new and potentially cost-saving remedial option to deal with a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> situation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Black <EM>et al.</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 20 at 239-240.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. There do not appear to be any Alberta cases considering the approaches of the Newfoundland or Ontario courts or, generally, whether an Alberta court has jurisdiction to make a transfer Order. Clearly though, this Honourable Court has inherent jurisdiction and jurisdiction to grant a stay on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In considering the learned authors' rationale, therefore, it would seem that the jurisdictional basis for ordering a transfer exists in Alberta.</P>
<P>28. In addition, this Honourable Court has jurisdiction under s. 8 of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> to &ldquo;grant...all remedies whatsoever...so that as far as possible...all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning those matters [may be] avoided.&rdquo; An Order requesting a transfer of proceedings into Saskatchewan is exactly that&mdash;a remedy that could avoid a multiplicity of legal proceedings. Consequently, s. 8 of the <EM>Judicature Act</EM> would also seem to form a jurisdictional basis on which to make an Order transferring the action to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>29. Accordingly, the fact that Alberta has not enacted the Uniform <EM>CJPTA</EM> is not prohibitive, as was concluded by Master Prowse. Clifton therefore asks that this Honourable Court make an Order requesting a transfer of the action to Saskatchewan in the event it determines that result is more appropriate than ordering a stay of the entire Alberta action.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. <UNDER>CONCLUSION</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. The partial stay granted by the Learned Master will likely give rise to a multiplicity of proceedings. Consequently, it should be replaced by either a stay of the entire action or an Order requesting that it be transferred to Saskatchewan. For the reasons given above, this Honourable Court has jurisdiction to make either Order.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>1. There are, surprisingly, five appeals before this Honourable Court. Four of those, by four Defendants in the within matter, appeal though they were successful in having the Action stayed against them, which was the relief originally sought.</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), submits this brief in response to the appeal materials filed by three of those four appellants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appeal Brief of Hatch Corporation filed November 16, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Brief&rdquo;); Brief of Law of the Applicant, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd., for an Application to be heard on December 3 and 4, 2018 at 2:00 P.M. filed November 16, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Brief&rdquo;); Brief of Law on Behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd., Respondent/Cross-Appellant filed November 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Brief&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> One of the Appellants, Intact, has filed nothing. These materials were, presumably, intended to be in support of the appeals filed by those parties (from the Order in which they were successful), although they appear to speak primarily to the issues addressed in the appeal initiated by CP. The seeming confusion amongst the appellants as to what is under appeal has significantly impaired CP's ability to provide a response that will be of assistance to the Court and this difficulty has been compounded by the fact that the appeals initiated focus not on the Order that was pronounced, but instead appear to target the <UNDER>reasons</UNDER> underlying that Order.</P>
<P>3. As set out in its brief filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CP Appeal Brief</BOLD>&rdquo;), after CP served this Action on the various defendants between January 10, 2018 and January 19, 2018, certain of the defendants&mdash;Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;made applications challenging the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The facts underlying this matter are set out in n the brief filed on behalf of CP in support of its appeal and are not repeated here.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The other two defendants, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;), attorned and have each filed Statements of Defence and Notices to Co-Defendants, against Hatch, KPCL, Clifton and Intact.</P>
<P>4. Hatch, KPCL, Clifton and Intact (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Objecting Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;) each asked, as an element of the relief sought in their respective applications, for an Order staying this action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of KPCL February 8, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Clifton February 23, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Intact March 26, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Hatch March 29, 2018 at para 2. Copies of these applications are attached as Appendices A, B, C and D, respectively.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, certain of the Objecting Defendants explicitly sought a stay only in respect of the Action as against themselves, precisely what the learned Master ordered. For example, Clifton sought &ldquo;an Order staying [the Action] in its entirety <UNDER>against Clifton</UNDER>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of Clifton February 23, 2018 at para 2, emphasis added (Appendix B).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> while Intact sought &ldquo;an Order staying this action in its entirety <UNDER>against Intact</UNDER>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of Intact March 26, 2018 at para 2, emphasis added (Appendix C).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. On July 25, 2018, Master J. T. Prowse issued a decision in which he concluded that although the Alberta courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this Action, that jurisdiction should nonetheless be declined on the basis that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and that Saskatchewan was a &ldquo;more suitable&rdquo; jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Master in Chambers, J.T. Prowse, filed July 25, 2018, Record of Proceedings at Tab 3, page A1073<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Order pronounced by Master Prowse confirms that:
<QUOTE><P>This action is stayed against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch and Intact, but only upon each of them filing an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order of Master J. T. Prowse pronounced July 25, 2018 and filed August 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Order</BOLD>&rdquo;) at para 1, Record of Proceedings at Tab 4, page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>6. Despite having been successful in their respective applications, each of the Objecting Defendants now appeals. It is, with respect, less than clear how the relief sought by Hatch, Clifton and KPCL&mdash;all of whom now want different things than one another and some of whom want different things than they did when they appeared before Master Prowse&mdash;arises out of an appeal of the Order issued by Master Prowse.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. DISCUSSION</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Substance of these Appeals</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. The Objecting Defendants seek a variety of relief through their respective appeals. Little, if any, of that relief is connected with the Order that is actually under appeal and, indeed, it has little connection with the relief that these same parties sought from Master Prowse.</P>
<P>8. In the brief filed in support of its appeal, Hatch expressly seeks an Order:
<P1>(a) Setting aside the Order pronounced by Master Prowse on July 25, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Striking the Statement of Claim in this Action as against Hatch for want of jurisdiction; and/or</P1>
<P1>(c) Declaring that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and staying the Action as against all the Defendants in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at para 95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>9. Based on the text of its brief, Hatch also appears to take issue with the portion of Master Prowse's Order that imposed conditions on the stay that was granted and now seeks an unconditional stay of the whole of the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 60&ndash;68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Hatch has not filed the undertaking ordered, which it offered at the hearing below, and now appeals that as well.</P>
<P>10. KPCL, for its part, is asking this Court to:
<P1>(a) Set aside the Statement of Claim as against KPCL for want of jurisdiction; and/or</P1>
<P1>(b) Declare that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and stay this Action, potentially at the same time as requesting a transfer of the Action to Saskatchewan; or</P1>
<P1>(c) Declare that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and stay this Action and any Notice to Co-Defendant as against KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>11. Clifton, on the other hand, asks that either the whole of the Action be stayed or that an Order be granted transferring the entirety of the Action to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As noted above, this represents an expansion of the relief Clifton sought before Master Prowse, through which it asked for (and received) &ldquo;an Order staying [the Action] in its entirety against Clifton&rdquo;. This is, with respect, not an appeal but a fresh application, which is not consistent with the <EM>Rules of Court</EM>.</P>
<P>12. Intact failed to file any additional materials in connection with the appeal it launched, and CP is therefore uncertain of Intact's current position. That said, in its application before Master Prowse, Intact was seeking (and, like Clifton, received) an &ldquo;Order staying this action in its entirety against Intact&rdquo;. CP is unclear what relief Intact is now claiming. It was successful.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>No Proper Basis for these Appeals</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. Regardless of the specific relief sought by each of the Objecting Defendants, there is no proper basis for appeals by the Objecting Defendants, let alone a basis for this Honourable Court to allow any of the requested relief.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Appeal of Reasons is Unfounded</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. Aside from the nature of the appeal, which the parties agree is a <EM>de novo</EM> proceeding, an appeal pursuant to Rule 6.14 is no different than any other appellate proceeding, in that what is involved is an appeal <UNDER>of the order made</UNDER>. This is confirmed in the applicable Rule:
<QUOTE><P>If a master makes a judgment or order, the applicant or respondent to the application may appeal <UNDER>the judgment or order</UNDER> to a judge. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta. Reg. 124/2010, rule 6.14(1), <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. This parallels the authority conferred upon the Court of Appeal, which has jurisdiction pursuant to the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c. J-2, subject to the <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, to hear and determine appeals respecting a &ldquo;judgment, order or decision&rdquo;. As the Court of Appeal has confirmed, this provides the basis only for appeals of those aspects of a decision that form part of the formal order or judgment granted. The right of appeal to which this gives rise does not extend to &ldquo;[d]iscussions in the reasons for decision&rdquo; that are not included in the formal order that forms the basis of the appeal.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Stoney v 1985 Sawridge Trust</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 439</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. The fact that an appeal is from the judgment given, rather than the reasons a court provides to explain that decision is, moreover, a &ldquo;long-standing common law principle.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R v R.E.M.</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 51</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Indeed, the Court of Appeal has described a focus by the Court of Queen's Bench upon reasons given, as opposed to the judgment granted, in interpreting the decision of another judicial body as reflecting an &ldquo;error of law&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Chisholm v Lindsey</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 21</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Here, the Objecting Defendants are in effect appealing not Master Prowse's Order, but his underlying Reasons for Decision. Complaints regarding the Reasons for a Judgment do not form the proper basis for an appeal. Indeed, all four appeals are nothing more than responses to CP's appeal of Master Prowse's Order.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>The Objecting Defendants Consented to the Limitations Undertaking</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. A consent judgment will not be lightly set aside. Indeed, this Court has held that a consent judgment should be undone only if the party challenging it establishes exceptional circumstances, such as that consent was induced through fraud, deceit or mutual mistake.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lofthang v Canadian Immigration Specialists Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 609</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. In order to take the benefit of the stay that was granted, each of the Objecting Defendants was required to file &ldquo;an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Order at para 1, Record of Proceedings at Tab 4, page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a matter which the Objecting Defendants now appeal.</P>
<P>21. Yet the basis for the Order was an offer from the main Objecting Defendant, KPCL, which was adopted by others. They offered the relief. It was granted. Now they appeal.</P>
<P>22. During the hearing below, Master Prowse specifically asked:
<QUOTE><P>What do you do with the, if I were to give a stay, what do you do with the limitation problem that CP would have in Saskatchewan?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 31, lines 35 and 36, Record of Proceedings at page A989.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>23. In direct response to this question, counsel for KPCL made the following offer:
<QUOTE><P>Alternatively, in those circumstances, if and only if it is a tipping factor in this Court's mind and would otherwise have the Court refused to stay the action on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> grounds, KPCL <UNDER>would be amenable</UNDER> to an order that in effect provides the same thing as a transfer under the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceeding Transfer Act</EM> as it relates to limitations. <UNDER>That is, KPCL would be agreeable to an order that provides that KPCL would not assert that the CP claim is barred because of a limitation period if</UNDER>, and I'm quoting from the legislation, the claim would not be barred pursuant to the limitation rule that would be applied by the Alberta court. That's taken right from section 22 of the Saskatchewan legislation. And <UNDER>if necessary. Sir, if and only if necessary. KPCL would provide an undertaking not to rely on limitations in that manner or an undertaking to act consistent with that provision of the legislation</UNDER>.</P>
<P><UNDER>Of course. KPCL would want to be able to rely on any limitations defences that may have already existed in the Alberta court at the time that it was filed, as of December of 2017</UNDER>. (emphasis added)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 35, lines 22&ndash;36, Record of Proceedings at page A993.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. The offer by counsel for KPCL was then adopted by counsel for other Objecting Defendants, as follows:
<P1>(a) Clifton stated that it &ldquo;would rely upon the points which were made by [counsel for KPCL] with respect to ... the territorial competence and in the forum, ... the most appropriate forum analysis.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 46, lines 15&ndash;17, Record of Proceedings at page A1004.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) Hatch &ldquo;supported all submissions made by counsel for Clifton Associates Limited and counsel for Kelly Panteluk Construction Limited.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 49, lines 24 - 25, Record of Proceedings at page A1007.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>25. Having expressly offered to provide undertakings not to rely upon limitations defences that were not available within this Action, it is not now open to these parties to renege and argue that an unconditional stay is warranted.</P>
<P>26. Curiously, Hatch has submitted that it is unclear &ldquo;as to what will result if any of the Applicants choose not to file the undertaking in accordance with the Order.&rdquo;</P>
<P>27. It is difficult to understand how any confusion could arise from the clear wording of the Order, which states that:
<QUOTE><P>This action is stayed against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch and Intact, but only upon each of them filing an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Order at para 1, Record of Proceedings at page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Further, this Court need not speculate as to what might happen &ldquo;if any of the Applicants choose to not file the undertaking&rdquo; as each of the Objecting Defendants other than Hatch has complied with this direction. The effect of Hatch's failure to do so is obvious&mdash;in the absence of a filed undertaking, this Action is not stayed against Hatch. CP would, accordingly, be within its rights to demand a Statement of Defence from Hatch and to note Hatch in default if that was not forthcoming, although CP will not take such a step before this Honourable Court renders its decisions regarding these appeals.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. The issues surrounding jurisdiction <EM>simpiiciter</EM> and <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> were addressed in detail in CP's Appeal Brief and, for the most part, that material serves as full answer to the materials filed by the Objecting Defendants. The following is, accordingly, confined to responses to specific errors and inconsistencies within the materials filed by the Objecting Defendants.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Generally</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. The briefs filed on behalf of Clifton and KPCL rely upon a shared mistake in respect of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> and <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Both assert that in assessing issues of jurisdiction, the Court must consider jurisdiction in respect of <UNDER>each defendant</UNDER>, as opposed to considering jurisdiction over the action <UNDER>as a whole</UNDER>. That is simply wrong and would lead to tautological results.</P>
<P>31. Clifton, for example, argues that:
<QUOTE><P>The court's decision should be governed by determining whether the court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over each of the defendants [and whether] it is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> for each of the defendants ...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. KPCL, for its part, explicitly claims that the &ldquo;jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> analysis is meant to ensure that a court has jurisdiction over each individual defendant in an action&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 40.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and argues that the Statement of Claim should be set aside as against KPCL for want of jurisdiction. In support of this proposition, KPCL cites paragraph 27 of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz v Goldhar</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at footnote 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That paragraph, with respect, says nothing of the sort and, indeed, contradicts KPCL's assertion.</P>
<P>33. The entirety of that paragraph of Justice C&oc;t&ea;'s decision sets out the following guidance regarding the meaning of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>Central to a proper understanding of the conflicts rules of Canadian private international law, and to the resolution of this appeal, is an appreciation of the distinct roles played by jurisdiction simpliciter and forum non conveniens ... <UNDER>The jurisdiction simpliciter analysis is meant to ensure that a court has jurisdiction. This will be the case where a &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; exists between a chosen forum and the subject matter of the litigation.</UNDER> The forum non conveniens analysis, on the other hand, is meant to guide courts in determining whether they should decline to exercise that jurisdiction in favour of a &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo; forum. (citations omitted, emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD> (excerpt only, full text of the decision included in the Authorities accompanying CP's Appeal Brief at Tab 4)</P1></P>
<P>34. Similarly, as outlined in CP's Appeal Brief, a proper assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> looks at the action as a whole, rather than at the specifics of each cause of action alleged or at the claims as against each party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 142.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. When the applicable law is properly considered, the result, as outlined in CP's Appeal Brief, should be a finding that the Alberta courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this Action and should exercise that discretion given the absence of evidence sufficient to establish Saskatchewan as the <UNDER>clearly</UNDER> more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER>Forum Selection Clauses</UNDER></TI>
<P>36. Both Hatch and Clifton contractually attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts (from which they now resile) and such agreements should be given significant weight in assessing whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 88&ndash;100.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The mischief that would otherwise entail would be serious in preserving the sanctity of contracts and agreements.</P>
<P>37. In its written submissions, Clifton appears to ignore its contractual attornment, which is obviously inconvenient to its position, in favour of attempting to explain why this Honourable Court has the authority to stay the whole of this Action. This should not be the starting point of Clifton's argument. As a first step, this Honourable Court should seek an explanation from Clifton as to why it should be permitted to avoid its contractual obligations. Absent such an explanation, Clifton should be held to its agreement and this Court should decline to hear further from Clifton with respect to forum.</P>
<P>38. Similarly, Hatch expressly seeks to avoid the ramifications of its contractual obligations, relying upon a strained interpretation of the attornment provision in its contract with CP that was expressly rejected by Master Prowse, and to CP's knowledge, has never been adopted or accepted by a court in Canada.</P>
<P>39. This approach would, if adopted, render contractual forum selection provisions meaningless. Instead of requiring parties to keep to their bargains, thus affording certainty to those parties about the forum in which their disputes would be litigated, jurisdiction would depend solely upon the parties preferences and a <EM>post hoc</EM> assessment. Such an outcome is inconsistent not only with the law of contract generally, but with the jurisprudence confirming the importance of ensuring that parties uphold their agreements as to forum selection, even if such agreements are later seen by those parties as potentially inconvenient.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 88&ndash;100.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Comparative Convenience</UNDER></TI>
<P>40. For the reasons set out in CP's Appeal Brief, the formalistic exercise of counting the heads of potential witnesses to assess comparative convenience should be given little weight, especially in the early stages of a proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 152.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. In this case, the corporate representatives (non lawyers) of both KPCL and Clifton have opined about which of their respective employees CP will want to question,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 at para 78, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(i), pages A7 and A19ff; Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 at paras 22 and 24, Record of Proceedings at Tab (l)(iii), page A305 and A306.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and it is upon the basis of those lists that they assert that the number of witnesses in Saskatchewan &ldquo;overwhelmingly supports&rdquo; Saskatchewan as the most appropriate forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 113.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. On the other hand, CP's counsel has, on a preliminary basis, arrived at quite different conclusions about which witnesses are likely to be questioned.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016, Exhibit 17, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1 (vi), page A781.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. It is difficult to prepare even preliminary lists of potential witnesses in advance of document production, and the prospect of identifying likely trial witnesses with any certainty at this stage is illusory. Notably, though, the list of potential witnesses prepared by KPCL appears to contain a number of people whose utility as potential witnesses is dubious at best, such as its Human Resources Manager and an HSE Coordinator. This list should be seen for what it is&mdash;a straw man constructed to bolster KPCL's arguments on jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage and Prejudice</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. Despite having offered the undertaking with respect to limitations as a means to redress the loss of juridical advantage to CP stemming from the potential effect of limitation periods in Saskatchewan, the Objecting Defendants now seek an unconditional stay of this entire Action (even against two Defendants that have defended), asking this Court to ignore the prejudice arising from CP's loss of juridical advantage.</P>
<P>45. Within this Action, CP enjoys the juridical advantage of having filed its Statement of Claim within the relevant limitation period, and having fulsome rights of discovery.</P>
<P>46. The Objecting Defendants baldly assert that CP's decision not to commence proceedings in Saskatchewan within the limitation period was unreasonable, with the suggested result being that CP should be penalized by a stay of this Action and the attendant potential exposure to limitations defences if it must proceed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 160; Hatch Brief at para 60.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. The suggestion that commencing this Action in Alberta was unreasonable cannot&mdash;in the face of the contractual attornment provisions that are in place&mdash;be given any credence, especially when advanced by Hatch, which agreed through its contract with CP to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>48. Such an argument would, moreover, require prescience on the part of plaintiffs. Modem complex commercial litigation almost invariably involves parties situated across a number of jurisdictions. The approach advocated by the Objecting Defendants would require that a plaintiff sue in the jurisdiction that the courts eventually determine is clearly more appropriate or, perhaps, sue in every plausible jurisdiction, to ensure that it is not vulnerable to limitations defences in a jurisdiction in which it did not initiate claims. Neither approach ought to be countenanced by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>49. The gamesmanship regarding limitation periods that has been at work since this Action was served is more transparent with these appeals.</P>
<P>50. During the proceedings before Master Prowse, KPCL's counsel assured the Court that:
<QUOTE><P>KPCL's intention was not motivated by seeking to have this matter move to Saskatchewan, to force CP to sue in Saskatchewan, and then claim the limitation period has expired between the date of filing the Alberta action and the date of filing the Saskatchewan action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 34, lines 24&ndash;27, Record of Proceedings at page A992.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>51. Clifton appears to have taken the position that Alberta limitations periods would continue to apply if this Action is transferred to Saskatchewan, with its counsel stating:
<QUOTE><P>With respect to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, I think ... with respect to any concerns about the limitation time periods that would be in flux or be in play, section 22 of that legislation clearly sets out how things were to, are to operate with respect to the acceptance of a, of an action transferred into Saskatchewan, and the language is clear with regard to the importation of the limitation period compliance or not. It seems to clearly accept that the facts are taken into that jurisdiction to apply the law that was, that was in play with respect to the issuance of the claim initially in the, in the host jurisdiction, the first jurisdiction, which in this case would be Alberta.</P>
<P>From our, from our perspective as an applicant, Clifton does not see it as an issue with respect to limitation periods and it should not be seen to be a block or a concern on the part of this Court to be hesitant to consider the whole argument with regard to the necessity, the reasons, the proper reason for the matter, the proper circumstance that this be taken to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at pages 46 - 47, lines 34 - 17, Record of Proceedings at pages A1004 - A1005.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>52. At the time, Hatch adopted those submissions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018, at page 49, lines 24 - 25, Record of Proceedings at A1007.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Now, however, the positions of the Objecting Defendants are inconsistent, with Hatch expressly taking a very different tack.</P>
<P>53. Hatch, at least, is transparent in its position&mdash;it not only believes it has limitations defences available to it in Saskatchewan, but plans to make full use of such defences.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 48, 59 and 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, it has refused to file an undertaking in accordance with Master Prowse's Order and openly muses in its brief about defying the Order. In fact, Hatch is keen to pursue limitation defences should this Action be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan. In its submissions, Hatch expressly warns that it will &ldquo;undoubtedly&rdquo; make limitations arguments based on its &ldquo;legitimate defence of limitations in Saskatchewan&rdquo; and, in what is surely a remarkable statement from the mouth of a party that contractually attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, asserts that any restriction upon its right to raise such defences would &ldquo;prejudice Hatch's rightful entitlement to a jurisdictional advantage in Saskatchewan&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 48, 59 and 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. KPCL and Clifton have not been as transparent&mdash;each of them seeks a stay of the entire action and/or a transfer of the whole to Saskatchewan. Neither of them, however, have expressed a position with respect to reliance upon limitation periods in Saskatchewan should a transfer occur.</P>
<P>55. It cannot seriously be suggested that CP will not be prejudiced if forced into Saskatchewan and required to contend with limitations defences that were unavailable to the defendants in this Action. Accordingly, the loss of juridical advantage to CP if this Action is either stayed or transferred in a manner that would preserve limitations defences available in Saskatchewan that are not available in Alberta is a factor that should weigh heavily in the assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Procedural Considerations</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. For the first time, as part of these appeals, the Objecting Defendants seek to stay not only CP's claims as against themselves but also as against Thurber and Altus (both of whom have defended). In addition, KPCL seeks to stay the Notices of Co-Defendants filed by Thurber and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>As outlined above, the initial applications made by Clifton and Intact sought to stay the Action only against those parties. The applications filed by Hatch and KPCL sought a stay. None of the parties sought a stay of the Notices filed by Thurber and Altus.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If granted, such an Order would have a significant effect on Thurber and Altus. It would, moreover, have that effect without allowing even the benefit of notice to either of them, as affected parties, that such relief would be sought.</P>
<P>57. Further, KPCL continues to assert that the fact that it was &ldquo;first-to-file&rdquo; should be given &ldquo;some weight&rdquo; in this Court's analysis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 148.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is, with respect, unsupportable in these circumstances. In <CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE></CASEREF>, the sole authority KPCL has provided for this proposition, the first claim was not only filed <UNDER>but served</UNDER> and a Statement of Defence had been filed before a parallel proceeding in another jurisdiction was commenced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>At footnote 285 of the KPCL Brief. KPCL cites two decisions: <CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Colonial Countertops Ltd v Maple Terrazzo Marble &amp; Tile Incorporated</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 752</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Colonial Countertops</EM>&rdquo;) at paras 75 - 76 for this proposition. <EM>Colonial Countertops</EM> does not appear to speak to this point.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While the Court referenced the &ldquo;first-to-file&rdquo; element, it appears to have been the fact that the first action was &ldquo;further along&rdquo; that was weighed in deciding which forum was most appropriate.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 7</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. KPCL cannot be allowed to rely on a filed but unserved claim to assert that Saskatchewan is the most appropriate forum, which essentially would allow a party to hedge its bets and lie in the weeds, if it is sued elsewhere. Adopting this approach would merely serve to encourage early filing of potentially duplicative claims in multiple jurisdictions by parties seeking to anchor future arguments regarding jurisdiction in the event those arose.</P>
<P>59. This Action, while filed later, was &ldquo;further along&rdquo; than KPCL's Saskatchewan Action at the time KPCL sought to challenge jurisdiction, with CP's claim having been served upon all of the parties while KPCL's claim remained unserved. This Action remains &ldquo;further along&rdquo;, with two Defendants having filed Statement of Defence and with this Honourable Court now hearing appeals in respect of Master Prowse's Order on jurisdiction. In KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, nothing beyond service of the Statement of Claim and CP's application for a stay of the need to file a Statement of Defence has transpired.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>Multiplicity of Actions</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. It appears to be common ground amongst the parties that a multiplicity of actions is to be avoided.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 71 and 72; Clifton Brief at para 28; KPCL Brief at para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. In pressing their arguments about the importance of avoiding a multiplicity of actions, however, Hatch, Clifton and KPCL&mdash;in a manner that is at best disingenuous&mdash;all submit that multiplicity of actions is an <UNDER>effect</UNDER> of Master Prowse's Order. For example, the following submissions, amongst others, have been made:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;The existing Order ... will create a multiplicity of proceedings.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at para 59.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;If the Alberta Action is permitted to proceed, it will create a multiplicity of proceedings...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;The partial stay granted by the Learned Master will likely give rise to a multiplicity of proceedings.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>62. These arguments are misguided. Master Prowse's Order did not <UNDER>create</UNDER> the current multiplicity of actions&mdash;that existed at the time KPCL first indicated that it would be challenging jurisdiction (although KPCL had not yet made CP aware that it had filed a separate claim in Saskatchewan.) And, remarkably, after the applications regarding jurisdiction were underway, KPCL then chose to file yet another action in Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably for the purpose of buttressing its position on jurisdiction by allowing it to argue that Saskatchewan was clearly a more appropriate forum for its (new) <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM> claim. Such a transparent attempt to bootstrap the position of the Objecting Defendants with respect to the jurisdiction should not, with respect, be allowed to succeed.</P>
<P>63. Arguments based upon the KPCL Originating Application establishing Saskatchewan as the clearly more appropriate forum must be rejected for the reasons set out in CP's Appeal Brief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 171 - 172.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. Moreover, this argument is inconsistent with KPCL's own position regarding the Originating Application. KPCL's asserts that the Originating Application has been heard, with the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan having reserved its decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at paras 35 and 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP takes issue with this position and maintains that it has not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan courts, let alone responded substantively to proceedings there. If, however, if it were the case that the Originating Application had been heard, according to KPCL's own logic the existence of the Originating Application&mdash;having already been heard by the Honourable Mr. Justice D. C. Chow with only a decision needed to complete the proceeding&mdash;would be irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction over this Action.</P>
<P>65. In essence, there are two scenarios open to the Court if multiplicity is truly to be avoided.</P>
<P>66. The first is to ignore the general principle that a Court that has jurisdiction over a claim should exercise that jurisdiction absent exceptional circumstances. As well, it would require one to ignore the forum selection clauses which both Hatch and Clifton agreed to as part of their contracts with CP. Finally, the nature of the process that might effect this result is uncertain, but would likely require crafting some sort of remedy moving this Action to Saskatchewan, perhaps through incorporating this Action into the KPCL Saskatchewan Action by way of Counterclaim or through a transfer of the whole to Saskatchewan through a request from this Court. Neither of these approaches offers certainty in respect of CP's position vis-&ag;vis limitations and, depending on how the move were accomplished (assuming it could be), further issues in respect of how Thurber and Altus would become parties to the Saskatchewan matter would likely arise, including additional questions with respect to the applicable limitation periods.</P>
<P>67. The second option is simple: one party, KPCL, pursues the matters at issue in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action and the KPCL Originating Application (assuming, contrary to KPCL's position, that the Originating Application has not yet been heard) as part of this Action. This would provide a fair result as well as an efficient means of addressing the existing multiplicity. All of the likely parties are already before this Honourable Court&mdash;as opposed to only two who are presently parties to KPCL's actions in Saskatchewan&mdash;and none are disadvantaged by having to face limitations defences with respect to claims, cross-claims and third party claims that could arise in Saskatchewan to the potential prejudice of not only CP but the other parties who would be new to a Saskatchewan action.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>68. In addition to the relief sought through its own appeal in respect of Master Prowse's Order, CP requests that this Honourable Court dismiss the appeals filed by the Objecting Defendants and grant costs in respect of these appeals to CP in any event of the cause, payable forthwith.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. This Reply Brief is submitted by Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;) as a response to matters raised in the Brief of Canadian Pacific Railway (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) dated November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CP Brief</BOLD>&rdquo;). KPCL relies on its brief dated November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Brief</BOLD>&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Defined terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the KPCL Brief.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> in full response to the CP appeal. This Reply Brief further responds to the CP Brief and supplements the KPCL Brief to address specific issues raised in the CP Brief.</P>
<P>2. In support of its position, CP unnecessarily and inaccurately speculates about, and criticizes, KPCL's evidence and conduct. Yet, at the same time, as the Plaintiff seeking to convince this Court that it has, and should exercise jurisdiction over KPCL and this Action, CP has not filed any evidence from a CP witness. CP has not tested the evidence of KPCL or any of the Objecting Defendants through questioning. CP instead attempts to rely on speculation and its counsel's argument as evidence to support its position. This should be given no weight.</P>
<P>3. CP's argument is based on two incorrect principles. First, CP incorrectly asserts that this Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over KPCL if there is a real and substantial connection only between Alberta and the Action or other Defendants, rather than a real and substantial connection between Alberta and KPCL or the claims made against KPCL in the Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Brief, paras 71, and 101&ndash;139.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, CP incorrectly assumes that this Court does not have jurisdiction to stay the entire Action, and that the Alberta Action must necessarily continue regardless of the outcome of the Applications. These fundamental errors upon which the CP Brief is founded, and other specific matters raised by CP, are addressed briefly below.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. REPLY TO CP'S STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>4. At paragraphs 48&ndash;55 of the CP Brief, in its description of the procedural history of this matter in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, CP includes speculation and insinuation regarding KPCL's motivations, strategy and conduct in terms of scheduling and other procedural steps.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Some examples are found at the following paragraphs of the CP Brief: Para 49: &ldquo;It is surely not a coincidence...&rdquo;; Para 51: &ldquo;Interestingly...&rdquo;; Para 53: &ldquo;presumably for strategic reasons...&rdquo; and &ldquo;a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course&rdquo;; Para 54: &ldquo;unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters. Only after forcing a court appearance...&rdquo;; Para 55: &ldquo;yet another claim&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The procedural facts speak for themselves: the relevant correspondence is before the Court, and it confirms that CP's speculation and insinuation are unfounded.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>McArdle Affidavit; Notice to Admit to CP.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A cursory review of that record confirms that KPCL has done nothing other than reasonably exercise its rights according to ordinary practice, procedure and legal principles.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI><EM>There is no real and substantial connection between Alberta and CP's Claims against KPCL</EM></TI>
<P>5. At paragraphs 71, and 101&ndash;139 of the CP Brief, CP argues that in order to assume jurisdiction in a given case, the &ldquo;necessary real and substantial connection is between the forum and the action, <UNDER>not</UNDER> between the forum and any specific party.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Brief, para 71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No authority is cited for this proposition and, with respect, it is incorrect. The Supreme Court of Canada has established that &ldquo;the purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation <UNDER>and the defendant</UNDER>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 99 [emphasis added] [<BOLD>Tab 8 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As such, the presumptive connecting factors identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> are intended to represent &ldquo;factors or factual situations that link the subject matter of the litigation <UNDER>and the defendant</UNDER> to the forum.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 79 [emphasis added] [<BOLD>Tab 8 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>ii</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Jurisdiction by consent is distinct from assumed jurisdiction</EM></TI>
<P>7. CP does not argue that there is presence-based jurisdiction or jurisdiction by consent over KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Brief; paras 69&ndash;71</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, in discussing jurisdiction by consent at paragraph 71 of the CP Brief, CP asserts that because certain of KPCL's co-defendants have allegedly consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, this somehow creates a real and substantial connection between Alberta and KPCL.</P>
<P>8. As set out in the KPCL Brief, jurisdiction by consent is a traditional common law basis for a court to take jurisdiction over a defendant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, para 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supreme Court of Canada has explicitly warned against conflating the traditional common law bases for jurisdiction with assumed jurisdiction, which is a wholly separate doctrine that has developed within its own &ldquo;respective sphere,&rdquo; and which involves a discrete test with unique constitutional limitations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 81 [<BOLD>Tab 12 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The &ldquo;fundamental distinction&rdquo; between the traditional common law bases for jurisdiction and assumed jurisdiction is that in the latter case, the defendant &ldquo;is not within the territorial jurisdiction of the court when the proceedings are commenced.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 89 [<BOLD>Tab 12 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Even if other Defendants have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court, this does not create a real and substantial connection to KPCL.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>iii</EM>.</N><TI><EM>No Tort in Alberta Related to Claims against KPCL</EM></TI>
<P>9. At paragraph 129&ndash;131 of the CP Brief, CP asserts negligent misrepresentations allegedly committed by Clifton in Alberta. To the extent that CP meets its onus to establish that these misrepresentations occurred in Alberta, they have no connection to KPCL, and cannot form a basis for assuming jurisdiction over KPCL. The fact that a foreign defendant's co-defendants may have allegedly committed a tort in the province is not enough to justify the assumption of jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Shah</EM>, at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In any event, in this case, there are no torts committed in Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>iv</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Applicability of Alberta Law is Not a Presumptive Connecting Factor</EM></TI>
<P>10. At paras 132&ndash;134 of the CP Brief, CP argues that the applicability of Alberta law is a presumptive connecting factor which grounds the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(c) provides that, for the purposes of service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection exists where the claim is governed by Alberta law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 11.25(3)(c) [<BOLD>Tab 2 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, as noted in the KPCL Brief, such service rules are procedural only and do not, by themselves, provide the Court the substantive basis to assert jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, para 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. In any event, whether the governing law should be recognized as a presumptive connecting factor is moot as it relates to the assertion of jurisdiction over KPCL. CP only alleges that contracts made with Clifton and Hatch will be governed by Alberta law. The law governing CP's claims against Clifton and Hatch cannot be relevant to the assumption of jurisdiction over KPCL. CP does not allege that KPCL's contract with CP will be governed by Alberta law, and indeed does not allege that any of its claims against KPCL will be governed by Alberta law.</P>
<P>12. The evidence is that CP's claims in tort and contract against KPCL will be governed by Saskatchewan law. Performance of the KPCL Contract was to occur entirely within the province of Saskatchewan and the lands being improved were located in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Saskatchewan has the system of law with the &ldquo;closest and most real connection&rdquo; to the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 111 [<BOLD>Tab 9 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Lilydale Cooperative Ltd v Meyn Canada Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 para 16</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>]; <EM>Royal CA</EM> at para 9 [<BOLD>Tab 65 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The KPCL Holdback Application is brought pursuant to the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;, KPCL Holdback Application.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicable law for claims made against KPCL is Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<BLOCK4><N><EM>i</EM>.</N><TI><EM>It Cannot be Assumed that the Alberta Action must Necessarily Proceed</EM></TI>
<P>13. At paragraph 175 of the CP Brief, CP bases its argument regarding multiplicity of proceedings on the proposition that its claims against Altus and Thurber must proceed in Alberta. As discussed in detail in the KPCL Brief, this proposition is wrong at law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 169&ndash;174.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's assumption presumes one of the very decisions this Court must make and undermines CP's <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. This Court has jurisdiction to stay the entire Action, regardless of whether some parties have attorned or would prefer to stay in Alberta.</P>
<P>14. Further, it should not be presumed that Altus and Thurber do in fact prefer to stay in Alberta, simply because they have attorned. They have taken no position in the within Application, despite having notice of it, and knowing they would be bound by it. If Altus or Thurber wished to retain the right to express a preference between Alberta and Saskatchewan, they were obliged to participate in the within Application and &ldquo;put their best foot forward.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>D'Onofrio v.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>ii</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Saskatchewan is the only Forum that Avoids a Multiplicity of Proceedings</EM></TI>
<P>15. At paragraphs 169&ndash;173 of the CP Brief, CP speculates regarding KPCL's conduct and motivations in pursuing its legal rights in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Some examples are found at the following paragraphs of the CP Brief: Para 169: &ldquo;it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions&rdquo;; Para 170: &ldquo;the motivations behind KPCL's second action are questionable&rdquo;; Para 171 &ldquo;<UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity&rdquo;; Para 172: &ldquo;again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action&rdquo;; Para 173: &ldquo;which in the normal course would amount an abuse of process&rdquo; and &ldquo;has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such commentary is irrelevant and unhelpful where KPCL has simply exercised its legal rights.</P>
<P>16. But, further, CP glosses over critical points:
<P1>(a) CP is the one party that could have avoided any multiplicity of proceedings by choosing to bring its claim in the obviously most connected jurisdiction, Saskatchewan: CP expressly reserved for itself the right to do so pursuant to the choice of forum clauses in the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Contract. There was nothing precluding CP from bringing its action in Saskatchewan. And CP could have done so much sooner. Although CP suggests that it &ldquo;wasted no time&rdquo; in proceeding with its claim in Alberta,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Brief, para 176.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the fact is that CP waited almost two years from the date of the Foundation Failure before it commenced its claim in Alberta. Further, there is no evidence supporting CP's assertion that it was unaware of KPCL's action in Saskatchewan;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Brief, para 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) as set out in the KPCL Brief, CP assumes incorrectly that a decision by the Alberta Court to exercise jurisdiction will be binding on the Saskatchewan Court;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, para 131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) KPCL has the right to have its Holdback Application determined pursuant to the summary procedures in Saskatchewan. The Holdback Application seeks narrow relief under the <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, sections 2(c), 7, 17, 38, 86&ndash;96 [<BOLD>Tab 1 of KPCL Brief</BOLD>]; <EM>The Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Sask Gaz December 27, 2013, 2684, r 3-49-3-56. [<EM>SK Rules</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 5</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which should be dealt with summarily and expeditiously and should reduce the time and expense of litigation between CP and KPCL.

<P1>(d) further, as described in the KPCL Brief, Saskatchewan is the only jurisdiction in which the Holdback Application can be resolved.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, para 131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's attempt to suggest that KPCL's Holdback Application does not have merit because the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM> cannot apply to federal undertakings is incorrect.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <CASEREF><SOC>CNR v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>T.

That application remains under reserve.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;29&rdquo;; Notice to Admit to CP; Schedules &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo;,&ldquo;E&rdquo; &ldquo;F&rdquo;, &ldquo;G&rdquo;, &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo;; KPCL Brief, Appendices &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo;, and &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>iii</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Witnesses and Convenience Favour Saskatchewan</EM></TI>
<P>17. At paragraph 150 of the CP Brief, CP lists a number of witnesses which it &ldquo;expects&rdquo; to be questioned. This list is apparently based on CP's review of the evidence of potential witnesses provided by the Objecting Defendants, but it is unclear why CP has understated the number of potential witnesses located in Saskatchewan by 22 witnesses.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, para 114.This includes 7 potential KPCL witnesses, 5 potential Clifton witnesses, 3 potential Broda witnesses, 2 potential Intact witnesses, and 5 potential government witnesses.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has filed no evidence regarding potential witnesses, and has conducted no cross-examination on the evidence in this regard. Respectfully, submissions from counsel regarding CP's expectations is not admissible evidence that can or should be relied on by this Court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lister v. Calgary (City)</SOC><CITE>1997 CarswellAlta 82</CITE><COURTJUR>ABCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>Lister</EM>], at para 9 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's suggested witness list has no factual foundation and should be given no weight.</P>
<P>18. At paragraph 155 of the CP Brief, CP alleges that while it would be inconvenient for KPCL and Clifton to litigate in Alberta, it would be equally inconvenient for CP and Altus to litigate in Saskatchewan. However, there is no evidence that CP or Altus would face any inconvenience if they were to litigate in Saskatchewan. Again, mere allegations from counsel are not evidence.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lister</EM> at para 9 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The uncontroverted evidence is that CP carries on business across the country and maintains offices, employees and employee accommodations in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 91; Clifton Affidavit, para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The evidence also indicates that the relevant Altus employees work out of Altus' office in Regina.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 65.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. At paragraph 158 of the CP Brief, CP suggests that the possibility of a site visit should be wholly rejected as being irrelevant to the assessment of forum <EM>non conveniens</EM>. While courts have discounted this factor in some circumstances, each case must be assessed on its facts. The case relied on by CP involved a railway derailment that occurred in Saskatchewan, allegedly caused by an improperly loaded rail car.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway v SSAB Alabama Inc</SOC><CITE>2018 SKQB 272</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>SSAB</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The defendant unsuccessfully argued that the Court's ability to &ldquo;take a view&rdquo; of the loading site, in Alabama was a factor which indicated that Alabama was a more convenient forum. The proposed site visit was not to the site of the accident itself, and it is therefore understandable that the Court required additional evidence as to why a site visit might be beneficial. In contrast, Courts have recognized that site visits may be a relevant factor when the proposed site visit involves attending the actual site of the accident in question.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Rivas v Damacio</SOC><CITE>1998 ABQB 313</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Foundation Failure occurred in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iv.</N><TI><EM>CP's Alleged Juridical Advantages Should be Given No Weight</EM></TI>
<P>20. At paragraphs 181&ndash;188 of the CP Brief, CP argues that procedural differences between Alberta and Saskatchewan as it relates to questioning of witnesses create a juridical advantage in favour of Alberta. KPCL submits that this assertion should be given no weight, for at least the following reasons:
<P1>(a) the undisputed evidence is that the supposed procedural difficulties associated with oral discovery alleged by CP do not actually arise in practice;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., sworn March 28, 2018, paras 17-18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) whether more or less oral discovery is an advantage or not, is really a matter of opinion. While CP suggests Alberta's discovery procedure is more advantageous, Master Prowse was of a different view.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is exactly the type of debate over procedure which have been held to be generally irrelevant to <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1986] 3 All E.R. 843</CITE><COURTJUR>HL</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at 859 [<BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As stated by the Alberta Court of Appeal, when an advantage of this type is alleged by the plaintiff, the court is &ldquo;not merely to assume that our procedure is superior, but ask ourselves whether substantial justice may be done notwithstanding the difference in procedure.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>United Oilseed Products Ltd v Royal Bank</SOC><CITE>1988 ABCA 207</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>1988 CarswellAlta 98</CITE><PARANUM>30</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clearly, substantial justice may be done in Saskatchewan, despite certain differences in relation to the questioning of witnesses; and</P1>
<P1>(c) CP ignores the fact that any benefits of Alberta in the discovery process will be outweighed by the inconvenience associated with a trial in Alberta.</P1></P>
<P>21. At paragraph 189&ndash;192 of the CP Brief, CP raises concerns about the juridical disadvantage posed by <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, if this Action is stayed in favour of Saskatchewan. These concerns are misplaced, as is the speculation that KPCL commencing proceedings in Saskatchewan was motivated by a desire to argue that CP is barred from proceeding in Saskatchewan. KPCL addressed this in oral argument before Master Prowse<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal of Master's Judgment or Order filed by CP on August 22, 2018, Tab 2, Transcript of proceedings before the Master on July 4 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>July 4 Transcript</BOLD>&rdquo;), pp 34&ndash;36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and KPCL has filed its Limitations Undertaking in accordance with Master Prowse's order. Further, the undisputed evidence is that if the Alberta Action is stayed, under Saskatchewan law CP will likely be able to bring all of its claims in Saskatchewan, even if no additional parties provide a Limitations Undertaking.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bergbusch Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>v</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Evidence of Harm to KPCL is Uncontradicted</EM></TI>
<P>22. At paragraph 46 of the CP Brief, CP attempts to undermine the uncontradicted evidence that if KPCL is forced to litigate the within Action in Alberta, it will have serious detrimental impacts on KPCL. Instead of cross-examining Kelly Panteluk on these issues, or bringing a motion to compel this information, CP has instead requested that this Court draw an adverse inference because, in a reply to a Notice to Admit Facts issued by CP, KPCL has taken the position that certain financial statements are irrelevant. An adverse inference &ldquo;will not be drawn where the proponent has not diligently used the broad powers available to discover the witness or evidence that they fault the other party for not bringing before the court.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tingley v Wellington Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2010 NSSC 465</CITE><PARANUM>458</PARANUM></CASEREF>, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co v Cooperators General Insurance Co</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>163 NSR (2d) 241</CITE><COURTJUR>NSCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at paras. 29&ndash;38 [<BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In any event, the financial statements sought by CP are not relevant to the impact of the Alberta Action on KPCL's business, reputation and management. The evidence in this regard is uncontested, and does not depend on any financial statements.</P>
<P>23. Similarly, at paragraphs 46-47 of the CP Brief, CP attempts to undermine the evidence that this Action is having a negative impact on the bonding support that Intact is able to provide to KPCL. Again, CP has elected not to conduct any cross-examination to contest or explore this evidence. Instead, CP misconstrues the distinction between the reduced level of bonding capacity Intact is able to provide to KPCL, and the question of whether KPCL has as of yet, been involved in further projects which require bonding capacity. CP attempts to characterize KPCL's evidence of regarding the financial impact of the within Action as &ldquo;unsubstantiated&rdquo; when in fact, this evidence is undisputed. If CP wished to dispute the evidence in this regard, the onus was on CP to cross-examine, or alternatively to file evidence of its own. As it has failed to do either, CP's allegations in this regard should be ignored.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>INTRODUCTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This is an Appeal by the Defendant/Applicant/Appellant, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;) from an Order granted by the Honourable Master J.T. Prowse (&ldquo;Master Prowse&rdquo;) from the combined Applications of the Defendants, Hatch, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;) (collectively, the &ldquo;Applicants&rdquo;). The Applicants each challenged the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the claim of the Plaintiff, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CP&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Plaintiff&rdquo;), or, alternatively, sought a stay of the CP's action based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1>Order of Master Prowse, filed March 1, 2018 (the &ldquo;Order&rdquo;)</P1></P>
<P>2. The reasons for the Order were published on July 25, 2018. In the Reasons for Judgment, Master Prowse, <EM>inter alia</EM>, determined this Court had jurisdiction simpliciter to hear the Plaintiff's claims against the Applicants, but that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveneins</EM> in favour of Saskatchewan.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment of Master Prowse, indexed as <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Hatch Corporation et al</SOC><CITE>2018 ABQB 558</CITE></CASEREF> (the &ldquo;Reasons for Judgment&rdquo;), filed July 25, 2018, para 8, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>3. However, the Order stated:
<QUOTE><P>This action is stayed against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch and Intact, <UNDER>but only upon each of them filing an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP</UNDER> in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017.</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>The Order, para 1</P1>
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 75, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>4. Hatch respectfully submits Master Prowse erred in determining that Alberta had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the Action.</P>
<P>5. In the alternative, while Master Prowse was largely correct in his analysis regarding <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, the resulting order has produced the potential for multiplicity of proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Alberta. In addition, it remains unclear as to what will result if any of the Applicants choose to not the file undertaking in accordance with the Order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>OVERVIEW OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. Due to expected and anticipated significant overlap between the within Appeal and the Appeals of KPCL, Clifton and Intact, this Brief on behalf of Hatch will focus on unique and particular facts as related to Hatch, and will not repeat anticipated and expected arguments from co-Appellants, but will rely upon same in argument at the Application itself, and as required. Further, Hatch relies upon its Brief filed in support of its Application in Masters Chambers.</P>
<P><BOLD>7. The Project</BOLD></P>
<P>8. This Action relates to the construction of a railway spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;). The purpose of the Project was to connect CP's main rail line to a potash mine owned by K+S Potash Canada General Partnership.</P>
<P>9. As part of the Project, an embankment was constructed on either side of the Qu'Appelle River in Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Embankment&rdquo;).</P>
<P>10. Construction of the Project and the Embankment occurred entirely in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>11. Hatch is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario, where its head office is located, and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta, with satellite offices across Canada, including Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
<P1>Affidavit of Andrew Paton, filed March 29, 2018 [&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;], at Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>12. Hatch is an engineering company which provides engineering, project and construction business consulting, and operational services to clients across Canada, and is the Canadian subsidiary of Hatch Associates Inc., an American corporation.</P>
<P>13. In January, 2012, CP and Hatch entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;Hatch Master Agreement&rdquo;) whereby Hatch would be available to provide professional engineering consulting services to CP as required by CP. The Hatch Master Agreement was amended on February 17, 2014 and December 5, 2014.</P>
<P>14. The Hatch Master Agreement contains, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following non-exclusive jurisdiction provision:
<QUOTE><P>25. Governing Law: <UNDER>This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta</UNDER> and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. <UNDER>The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive</UNDER> jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
(the &ldquo;Hatch Forum Selection Clause&rdquo;).
<P1>Paton Affidavit, at Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>15. In August, 2012, Hatch prepared a proposal for the Project (the &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;). The Proposal was updated on or about November 29, 2013.</P>
<P>16. After a series of discussions and correspondence, in January, 2014, the Proposal was accepted by CP on the terms set out in the Hatch Master Agreement.</P>
<P>17. All discussions pertaining to the Proposal and the agreement for Hatch to perform work on the Project were with Glenn Whitham (&ldquo;Mr. Whitham&rdquo;) of CP's Strategic Sourcing Group. Mr. Whitham worked out of CP's Mississauga, Ontario office.</P>
<P>18. While initial design work performed by Hatch in respect of the Project was primarily done through Hatch's Calgary office, Hatch's involvement in the actual construction of the Project, which commenced in Spring, 2015, and overseeing of same, took place at the Project site in Saskatchewan, to view construction progress.
<P1>Paton Affidavit, at para 16</P1></P>
<P>19. On or about December 5, 2015, the foundation of the Embankment began to fail during construction (the &ldquo;Embankment Foundation Failure&rdquo;).</P>
<P>20. Prior to the Embankment Foundation Failure, Hatch was no longer involved in the day to day operations of the Project, having been replaced by Clifton in or about April, 2015, once Clifton replaced Thurber.</P>
<P>21. Hatch has had no involvement with the Project since being replaced.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Commencement of Proceedings</TI>
<P>22. In August, 2017, KPCL commenced an action in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench against CP seeking damages for work performed on the Project by KPCL.</P>
<P>23. CP filed the within Action on December 1, 2017, days short of the two year anniversary of the Embankment Foundation Failure.</P>
<P>24. CP's Action seeks damages and costs it alleges it suffered as a result of various alleged breaches of contract, negligence or misrepresentations relating to the Project.</P>
<P>25. Hatch filed an Application seeking to strike CP's claim based on a lack of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> or, alternatively, to stay CP's Action as against the Applicants based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. KPCL, Clifton and Intact filed applications seeking similar relief.</P>
<P>26. The defendants, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;Thurber&rdquo;) and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;Altus&rdquo;), took no position on the Applicants' application.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Decision of Master Prowse</TI>
<P>27. Master Prowse determined that Alberta had consent based jurisdiction <EM>simplicitor</EM> regarding the claims against Hatch through the Hatch Forum Selection Clause.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, paras 13-14</P1></P>
<P>28. However, Master Prowse also determined that Alberta was <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. Hatch respectfully submits the issues to be determined are as follows:
<P1>(a) Did Master Prowse err in determining that CP established consent based jurisdiction based on the non-exclusive Hatch Forum Selection Clause?</P1>
<P1>(b) Does the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the causes of action alleged?</P1>
<P1>(c) Did Master Prowse err in making the stay conditional upon the Applicants filing undertakings regarding the use of a limitations defence in Saskatchewan?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. <UNDER>LAW</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Law Governing the Appeal</TI>
<P>30. An Appeal to a Judge in Chambers from a decision of a Master in Chambers is made pursuant to section 12 of the <EM>Court of Queen's Bench Act</EM> and <EM>Rule</EM> 6.14.

<P>31. It is clear law in Alberta that an appeal from a Master is <EM>de novo</EM>. No deference is owed to the Master. The Chamber's Judge is not bound by any finding, of fact or otherwise, made by the Master. The standard of review is &ldquo;correctness&rdquo;.

<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Clause does not apply</TI>
<P>32. In the Reasons for Judgment, Master Prowse outlined the three ways how a court can claim jurisdiction:
<QUOTE><P>[9] The three alternative ways in which a court obtains jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over a defendant are:
<P1>(i) presence-based jurisdiction: resulting from the defendant being served within the territory of the court;</P1>
<P1>(ii) consent-based jurisdiction: resulting from the defendants either agreeing prior to the litigation to a certain court being the forum to hear the dispute, or expressly or impliedly consenting after the commencement of the action to the forum being chosen by the plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>(iii) assumed jurisdiction: resulting from the service of process on a foreign defendant outside the territory of the court.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 9</P1></P>
<P>33. Hatch respectfully submits Master Prowse erred in determining that jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> was established by consent.</P>
<P>34. The Hatch Forum Selection Clause pertains to the interpretation of the Hatch Master Services Agreement, but does not refer to the services performed by Hatch. Again, for ease of reference:
<QUOTE><P><EM>25. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of Jaws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury</EM>.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>35. As the Hatch Master Services Agreement was drafted and prepared by CP, the onus is on CP to ensure all items it wished to include, were in fact included in same. As it did not include a forum selection clause for the actual performance of the services, it cannot now suggest same is required. There is an Entire Agreement clause within the Hatch Master Services Agreement, at clause 29 therein.
<P1>Paton Affidavit, at Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>36. In the alternative, Hatch submits the Hatch Forum Selection Clause is ambiguous in two ways, and therefore, it should be interpreted against CP, under the doctrine of <EM>contra proferentum</EM>.</P>
<P>37. Had CP wished for the services performed by Hatch to be subject to the Hatch Forum Selection Clause, it should have inserted same. The Hatch Forum Selection Clause solely governs the interpretation of the Hatch Agreement, and the cause of Action alleged in this Action does not pertain to the interpretation of the Hatch Agreement. Thus, it is respectfully submitted by Hatch the Hatch Forum Selection Clause does not apply to this Action.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Limited v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>[1980] 1 SCR 888</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Tab 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. For CP to have ensured the Alberta Courts governed all aspects between the parties, it should have said so. A statement as follows might have been sufficient:
<QUOTE><P><EM>This Agreement, and the provision of services hereunder, and any disputes relating thereto, shall be governed by the courts of the Province of Alberta</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>39. Of course, as we are aware, CP did not do so, thus, Hatch should not be bound by something which CP did not include in the Agreement. This is distinguishable from the clause as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Zi Corporation v. Steinberg</SOC></CASEREF>, wherein Wittmann C.J. held that the phrase &ldquo;any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement&rdquo; was sufficient to encapture all manners of disputes. The similar analysis here should follow that failing to use such phrasing is insufficient to force the forum to be Alberta.

<P>44. In <CASEREF><SOC>Expedition Helicopters Inc v Honeywell Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal enforced the following jurisdiction clause:
<QUOTE><P>CHOICE OF LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONTROLLED AND INTERPRETED UNDER THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA, EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICT OR CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS.

<P>45. The foregoing complete forum selection clauses, as enforced by the respective courts, contain wording with respect to the clause applying to disputes, legal proceedings, legal actions, etc. However, the Hatch Forum Selection Clause contains no such wording.</P>
<P>46. The Hatch Forum Selection Clause only speaks to the interpretation and governance of, not disputes arising out of, the Hatch Master Services Agreement. In <CASEREF><SOC>2249659 Ontario Ltd. v Sparkasse Siegen</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal, with respect to forum selection clauses, stated:
<QUOTE><P>I will assume that there is a forum selection clause in favour of Germany in the Purchase Orders. Even on that assumption, however, the respondents must still demonstrate that the claims against them fall within the ambit of the language in the forum selection clause.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>2249659 Ontario Ltd. v. Sparkasse Siegen</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 354</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>47. CP has failed to establish the Hatch Forum Selection Clause applies to any legal disputes, such as tort or breach of contract, as alleged in CP's Statement of Claim. Therefore, Hatch submits the Hatch Forum Selection Clause is unenforceable for being ambiguous in its application and interpretation, or only applies to the interpretation of the Hatch Master Agreement.</P>
<P>48. If this Honourable Court finds it cannot establish jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> based on the Hatch Forum Selection Clause, then this Honourable Court cannot place conditions on a stay for forum, specifically, with respect to any limitations arguments Hatch will undoubtedly make in the Saskatchewan action.</P>
<P>49. With respect to jurisdiction simpliciter and limitations, in <CASEREF><SOC>Jordan v Shactz</SOC></CASEREF>, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated:
<QUOTE><P>24 In my opinion, the expiry of the limitation periods in other provinces where the action could have been heard is not a factor grounding jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. Unlike a defendant's residency, physical presence or location of the defendant's assets, the expiry of the limitation period is not a factor connecting British Columbia to the defendant. Furthermore, it is not part of the subject of matter of the litigation or &ldquo;transaction,&rdquo; which in this case is the motor vehicle accident. Rather, it is a legal bar to bringing the action in the relevant foreign jurisdiction. Although this question has not been raised squarely before this Court before, I agree with and share the concern that Hollinrake J.A. expressed on this matter in the <EM>Ell</EM> case.</P>
<P>25 To hold otherwise would be unmindful of the territorial sovereignty of other provinces. On this point I note that if a court has jurisdiction but declines it under <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, the court may condition the stay of proceedings on, among other things, the defendant agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction of the more proper forum or to waive a statute of limitations defence in the other forum. However, before doing so, jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> must already exist. A court which lacks jurisdiction has no authority to impose such conditions. In my respectful opinion, the reasoning that a court's jurisdiction to effectively remove a bar to litigating in another forum could be based precisely on the existence of that bar is circular.</P>
<P>26 The fact that no other forum is available to the plaintiff, due to the lapse of a limitation period in another jurisdiction, unfortunately does not bear upon the question of whether British Columbia has jurisdiction. The respondent argues that there is an additional connecting factor in that she was a passenger in a motor vehicle licensed and insured in B.C. and driven by a B.C. resident. But like her residency, this is a fact related only to the plaintiff's connections to B.C. It has nothing to do with the defendant and does not tie the cause of action sufficiently closer to this jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Jordan v Schatz</SOC><CITE>2000 BCCA 409</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Jordan</EM>], paras 24&ndash;26, <BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>50. The second factor rendering the Hatch Forum Selection Clause ambiguous is same provides CP with an option to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. Hatch submits this is ambiguous as it renders the forum selection, being Alberta, not a true forum selection if CP is able to take proceedings in other jurisdictions. Once again, Hatch submits the Hatch Forum Selection Clause should be deemed to be unenforceable.</P>
<P>51. In the alternative, if the Hatch Forum Selection Clause is enforceable, does the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench have jurisdiction over this Claim?</P>
<P>52. In order to establish jurisdiction, there needs to be a &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; to the jurisdiction suggested, by satisfying the list of presumptive connecting factors, as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>To recap, in a case concerning a tort, the following factors are presumptive connecting factors that, prima facie, entitle a court to assume jurisdiction over a dispute:</P>
<P>a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Van Breda v. Village Resorts Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Van Breda</EM>], para 90, <BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(a)</EM></N><TI><EM>Is Hatch Domiciled in Alberta</EM>?</TI>
<P>53. Hatch is domiciled in Ontario, with its head office located in Mississauga. Hatch is extra-provincially registered in Alberta. All Directors are located in Mississauga, while its voting shareholder is located in Delaware. The location of a Calgary office may provide a weak connection, at best, but the bulk herein establishes Hatch as not being domiciled in Alberta, thus this connection is not met.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(b)</EM></N><TI><EM>Does Hatch Carry on Business in Alberta</EM>?</TI>
<P>54. It is acknowledged Hatch carries on business in Alberta, although the subject matter is not related to Alberta. This is not a strong connecting factor to Alberta, and can be rebutted by the fact the subject matter is not related to Alberta, but is related to Saskatchewan.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, para 96, <BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(c)</EM></N><TI><EM>Was the Alleged Tort Committed in Alberta</EM>?</TI>
<P>55. This is unequivocally no. The Embankment Foundation Failure supporting any cause of action occurred in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. This is a strong factor against a connection to Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(d)</EM></N><TI><EM>Was the Contract Made in Alberta</EM>?</TI>
<P>56. There is simply no evidence the Hatch Master Agreement was made in Alberta, thus there is no connecting factor to Alberta.</P>
<P>57. Based upon the above, the only connecting factor is that Hatch does carry on business in Alberta. That is it. This can be rebutted by the fact the cause of action is not connected to the business performed in Alberta. As such, it is respectfully submitted there is no presumptive connection to Alberta.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Alberta Proceedings Should be Entirely and Unconditionally Stayed in Alberta in favour of Saskatchewan</TI>
<P>58. In the alternative, even if this Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, Hatch submits Master Prowse erred, after determining that Alberta was <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, by ordering that:
<P1>(a) The stay of the Action be conditional upon &ldquo;each&rdquo; of the Applicants filing undertakings not to raise limitation defences against CP; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The stay of the Action was only as against the Applicants and not the entire action.</P1></P>
<P>59. The existing Order wrongfully disentitles Hatch from pursuing its legitimate defence of limitations in Saskatchewan and will create a multiplicity of proceedings. As such, the Order should be set aside in favour of an unconditional stay in favour of all Defendants to the Action.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Hatch is entitled to an Unconditional Stay of the Alberta Action</EM></TI>
<P>60. Hatch submits that CP is not entitled to protection from limitations in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> doctrine. CP was unreasonable in pursuing this Action in Alberta despite the claim clearly being more appropriately brought in Saskatchewan. Requiring a stay conditional upon the filing of undertakings limiting the defence of limitations was therefore in error, and protects CP from its own mistake, to the detriment of Hatch.</P>
<P>61. Hatch admits, in some circumstances, courts have some ability to conditionally stay proceedings based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Typically, the action is stayed but can be recommenced if an event occurs. Such conditions exist to reduce the potential prejudice of a loss of judicial advantage by a plaintiff.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Pre Print Inc. v. Maritime Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co.</SOC><CITE>1999 ABQB 890</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. However, conditional orders are not to be used in every circumstance. In particular, consideration must be made as to whether it is proper for a plaintiff to enjoy judicial advantage.</P>
<P>63. A party can have no reasonable expectation of advantages available in a jurisdiction with which the party and the subject matter of the litigation has little or no connection. Any loss of advantage to the foreign plaintiff must be weighed as against the loss of advantage, if any, to the defendant in the foreign jurisdiction if the action is tried there rather than in the domestic forum.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board)</SOC><CITE>1 SCR 897</CITE><PARANUM>60</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Tab 15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. In <CASEREF><SOC>Olney v Rainville</SOC></CASEREF>, the appellant resisting a stay of proceedings based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> argued any stay should be &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; and lifted in the event the courts of Quebec refused to deal with the matter &ldquo;on the merits&rdquo;. The British Columbia Court of Appeal refused to grant a conditional stay, stating:
<QUOTE><P>[56] <UNDER>Assuming that <EM>Pan-Afric Holdings</EM> is correct in holding that a conditional stay is appropriate in certain circumstances, it is my view that those circumstances are not present in this case</UNDER>. The remedy that is sought&mdash;a declaration of paternity&mdash;is a discretionary one, not one of right. The courts of Quebec are territorially competent to determine the applicable law, and to exercise any discretion that exists. If they find that a declaration should not be granted as a result of s. 530 of the Quebec Civil Code, then that decision ought to be respected by the courts of British Columbia. <UNDER>It would be presumptuous of this Court, having found that the courts of Quebec are the appropriate forum for this matter, to limit its deference to those courts to decisions which it considers to be &ldquo;on the merits&rdquo;</UNDER>.</P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Olney v. Rainville</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 380</CITE><PARANUM>54&ndash;57</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Tab 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>65. While the application of a limitations defence in Saskatchewan could be considered mandatory, not discretionary, other courts have given little weight to the plaintiff's loss of judicial advantage due to the imposition of a limitation period.</P>
<P>66. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hurst v. Soci&ea;t&ea; Nationale de l'Amiante</SOC></CASEREF>, the plaintiffs filed a claim for oppression in Ontario in 1987 but did not file an action in Quebec relating to the same claims at the time it was brought in Ontario. After actions in other jurisdictions were exhausted, the plaintiffs sought to proceed with the action in Ontario. The defendants sought a stay of the action based on, <EM>inter alia, forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hurst v. Soci&ea;t&ea; Nationale de l'Amiante</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 573</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Hurst</EM>] <BOLD>Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. The Chambers Judge stayed the plaintiffs' action, noting there was no reason for the appellants to not have commenced the action in Quebec at the time it was brought in Ontario. Rather, the defendants suffered a judicial disadvantage by &ldquo;by being deprived of a limitation defence if the action was allowed to proceed in Ontario when it was otherwise not the appropriate forum.&rdquo; This decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal, stating:
<QUOTE><P>52 Of equal importance, in my view, is the fact that a number of the respondents clearly advised the appellants back in 1988 that they intended to challenge the choice of forum. Consistent with their overall delay in proceeding with this action, the appellants allowed the jurisdiction issue to lay dormant until 2005, knowing that they were losing their opportunity to litigate the oppression case in Quebec. <UNDER>It is only because of the appellants' choice not to begin an oppression action in Quebec within the limitation period that loss of juridical advantage became a factor in the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> analysis. As a result, it is not a factor that should carry much weight.</UNDER></P>
<P>[emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Hurst</EM>, paras 51-52, <BOLD>Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>68. Hatch submits Saskatchewan was always the appropriate forum for the subject matter of the Action. CP acted unreasonably in filing its action in Alberta over Saskatchewan. CP should therefore not be entitled to any benefit of a conditional stay of the action. To do so would prejudice Hatch's rightful entitlement to a jurisdictional advantage in Saskatchewan. Further, the issue of the application of any limitation periods in Saskatchewan should be determined by the courts in that jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Order Creates a Multiplicity of Proceedings</EM></TI>
<P>69. Master Prowse erred in only partially staying the action within Alberta. A partial and conditional stay will produce a multiplicity of proceedings by requiring the actions to continue in both Alberta between CP, Thurber and Altus and in Saskatchewan as between Hatch, KPCL and Intact. As such, the Action of CP in Alberta should have been stayed in its entirety.</P>
<P>70. Section 5(3)(f) of the Judicature Act, RSA 2000, c J-2 provides this court with express jurisdiction to prevent multiplicity of proceedings.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, s 5(3)(f), <BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>71. The desirability to avoid multiplicity of proceedings is a factor for the test of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. The consideration of multiplicity in forum challenges is sometimes referred to as the principal of <EM>lis alibi pendens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 105, 109-110, <BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Direct Energy Marketing Ltd. v. Hillson</SOC><CITE>1999 ABQB 455</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Direct Energy</EM>], paras 50-51, <BOLD>Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>72. Parallel proceedings in other courts should be avoided. Multiplicity raises issues of <EM>res judicata</EM>, conflicting or inconsistent judgments, the inefficient use of judicial resources and concerns of a race to obtain judgment between the jurisdictions.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, paras 105, 109-110, <BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Direct Energy</EM>, paras 50-51, <BOLD>Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. The Hatch Application sought a &ldquo;declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying this Action in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan&rdquo;. Hatch was not seeking to split the action but rather have this matter entirely heard in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>74. The current Order will split the action into two parallel proceedings, one in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan, both adjudicating the same subject matter. This will create real concerns regarding the efficient use of court resources and potential conflicting judgments relating to the existence and degree of liability, if any, between the Parties.</P>
<P>75. Notably, if this matter proceeds in Saskatchewan, and remains as against Thurber and Altus in Alberta, Hatch may issue third party proceedings against Thurber and Altus in the aforesaid Saskatchewan action. This will mean Thurber and Altus will be forced to adjudicate in Alberta while also responding to claims for contribution and indemnity in Saskatchewan over the same subject matter. Conversely, Thurber and Altus will have no remedy against any of the Applicants in Alberta, unless they Third Party them in Alberta.</P>
<P>76. Thurber and Altus have received notice of the Hatch Application and its submissions but have taken no position regarding same. However, the claims against Thurber and Altus must be heard with those against the other Defendants. To allow otherwise would be a waste of court resources and create a real risk of prejudice to all parties regarding conflicting judgments.</P>
<P>77. Hatch submits the entire Action in Alberta, including the claims against Thurber and Altus, should be stayed so the proceedings can be fully adjudicated in one jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Alberta is <EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></TI>
<P>78. Hatch generally takes no issue with Master Prowse's <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. However, for clarity purposes, Hatch will set out the appropriate considerations for why Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P>
<P>79. CP's cause of action is based on the Embankment Foundation Failure, which took place in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. Thus the Courts of Saskatchewan have territorial competence to hear such an action.</P>
<P>80. Once territorial competency is established, the onus is on Hatch and the other co-Applicants to establish why Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. That is, why this matter is best heard in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>81. <EM>Van Breda</EM> set out the following factors when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) The location of the parties;</P1>
<P1>(b) The location of the witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(c) The cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(d) The impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(e) Problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) The relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, paras 103 and 110, <BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>82. Each of these factors shall be reviewed in turn.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(a)</EM></N><TI><EM>The impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings</EM></TI>
<P>83. Respectfully, Master Prowse erred in determining that multiplicity of actions is a neutral factor in this matter.
<P1>Judgment Reasons, para 58</P1></P>
<P>84. As discussed above, allowing both actions to proceed would create a multiplicity of actions in both Saskatchewan and Alberta regarding the same subject matter.</P>
<P>85. However, if the Action stayed in its entirety, against all Defendants, the proceedings will likely all be heard in Saskatchewan. There is no Application known to Hatch to have this Saskatchewan Action stayed for the Alberta Action.</P>
<P>86. As such, this factor is strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(b)</EM></N><TI><EM>Problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments</EM></TI>
<P>87. There are no concerns regarding recognition or enforcement of the judgment of a Saskatchewan judgment within Alberta, British Columbia, or Ontario, being the home jurisdictions of the Defendants, via the each province's respective <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>. As such, there are no problems to suggest this Action should not be heard in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(c)</EM></N><TI><EM>The relative strengths of the connections of the parties</EM></TI>
<P>88. The following considerations suggest this factor favours proceedings in Saskatchewan:
<P1>(a) All parties have operations in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(b) Altus is the only party with its partnership registered in Alberta along with a head office in this province;</P1>
<P1>(c) The federally incorporated Clifton has its head office in Saskatchewan, as does KPCL, which is also incorporated in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(d) Hatch is incorporated and has its head office in Ontario, with offices in both Saskatchewan and Alberta.</P1>
<P1>(e) Thurber is incorporated and holds its head office in British Columbia, but does have operations in each of Saskatchewan and Alberta.</P1>
<P1>(f) Finally, federally incorporated CP has its head office in Calgary and has offices throughout Saskatchewan.</P1></P>
<P>89. These factors suggest a common connection between the parties and Saskatchewan, where the cause of action allegedly arose. This suggests Saskatchewan is the preferred jurisdiction for this matter.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(d)</EM></N><TI><EM>Where the services were provided</EM></TI>
<P>90. The action pertains to the construction of a rail spur in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. While the initial drafting by Hatch took place in Calgary, the services were for a site in Saskatchewan, and repeated trips to Saskatchewan were required to commence, and for the fulsome performance of, the services, including site visits and finalisation of design specifications. This factor is strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.

<P>91. It is undisputed that the Embankment Foundation Failure took place at the site of the Project, being Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>92. It is likely experts will have to attend the site of the Embankment Foundation Failure itself, to observe and gather evidence. It is also possible attendance upon the site will be required during the trial. This factor is also strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Timeliness</EM></TI>
<P>93. Mr. Panteluk has set out the booking dates for trials in the respective jurisdictions, being 2021 in Alberta, and 2019 in Saskatchewan. Master Prowse was correct that this gives Saskatchewan a significant advantage as a forum for the dispute.</P>
<P>94. It is thus the respectful submission of Hatch, in these circumstances, taking into account all factors, this dispute should to be dealt in its entirety and unconditionally within Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. <UNDER>REMEDY SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>95. Hatch respectfully seeks the following relief:
<P1>(a) An Order setting aside the Order of Master Prowse pronounced on July 25, 2018, filed on August 16, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) An Order striking the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, CP as against the Defendant, Hatch for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>(c) Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying this action as against all Defendants in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(d) Costs of this application on a Solicitor and his own client, full indemnity basis; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 16<SUP>th</SUP> day of November, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>1. There are, surprisingly, five appeals before this Honourable Court. Four of those, by four Defendants in the within matter, appeal though they were successful in having the Action stayed against them, which was the relief originally sought.</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), submits this brief in response to the appeal materials filed by three of those four appellants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appeal Brief of Hatch Corporation filed November 16, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Brief&rdquo;); Brief of Law of the Applicant, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd., for an Application to be heard on December 3 and 4, 2018 at 2:00 P.M. filed November 16, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Brief&rdquo;); Brief of Law on Behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd., Respondent/Cross-Appellant filed November 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Brief&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> One of the Appellants, Intact, has filed nothing. These materials were, presumably, intended to be in support of the appeals filed by those parties (from the Order in which they were successful), although they appear to speak primarily to the issues addressed in the appeal initiated by CP. The seeming confusion amongst the appellants as to what is under appeal has significantly impaired CP's ability to provide a response that will be of assistance to the Court and this difficulty has been compounded by the fact that the appeals initiated focus not on the Order that was pronounced, but instead appear to target the <UNDER>reasons</UNDER> underlying that Order.</P>
<P>3. As set out in its brief filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CP Appeal Brief</BOLD>&rdquo;), after CP served this Action on the various defendants between January 10, 2018 and January 19, 2018, certain of the defendants&mdash;Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;made applications challenging the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The facts underlying this matter are set out in n the brief filed on behalf of CP in support of its appeal and are not repeated here.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The other two defendants, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;), attorned and have each filed Statements of Defence and Notices to Co-Defendants, against Hatch, KPCL, Clifton and Intact.</P>
<P>4. Hatch, KPCL, Clifton and Intact (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Objecting Defendants</BOLD>&rdquo;) each asked, as an element of the relief sought in their respective applications, for an Order staying this action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of KPCL February 8, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Clifton February 23, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Intact March 26, 2018 at para 2; Application filed on behalf of Hatch March 29, 2018 at para 2. Copies of these applications are attached as Appendices A, B, C and D, respectively.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, certain of the Objecting Defendants explicitly sought a stay only in respect of the Action as against themselves, precisely what the learned Master ordered. For example, Clifton sought &ldquo;an Order staying [the Action] in its entirety <UNDER>against Clifton</UNDER>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of Clifton February 23, 2018 at para 2, emphasis added (Appendix B).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> while Intact sought &ldquo;an Order staying this action in its entirety <UNDER>against Intact</UNDER>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application filed on behalf of Intact March 26, 2018 at para 2, emphasis added (Appendix C).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. On July 25, 2018, Master J. T. Prowse issued a decision in which he concluded that although the Alberta courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this Action, that jurisdiction should nonetheless be declined on the basis that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and that Saskatchewan was a &ldquo;more suitable&rdquo; jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Master in Chambers, J.T. Prowse, filed July 25, 2018, Record of Proceedings at Tab 3, page A1073<EM>ff</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Order pronounced by Master Prowse confirms that:
<QUOTE><P>This action is stayed against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch and Intact, but only upon each of them filing an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order of Master J. T. Prowse pronounced July 25, 2018 and filed August 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Order</BOLD>&rdquo;) at para 1, Record of Proceedings at Tab 4, page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>6. Despite having been successful in their respective applications, each of the Objecting Defendants now appeals. It is, with respect, less than clear how the relief sought by Hatch, Clifton and KPCL&mdash;all of whom now want different things than one another and some of whom want different things than they did when they appeared before Master Prowse&mdash;arises out of an appeal of the Order issued by Master Prowse.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. DISCUSSION</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Substance of these Appeals</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. The Objecting Defendants seek a variety of relief through their respective appeals. Little, if any, of that relief is connected with the Order that is actually under appeal and, indeed, it has little connection with the relief that these same parties sought from Master Prowse.</P>
<P>8. In the brief filed in support of its appeal, Hatch expressly seeks an Order:
<P1>(a) Setting aside the Order pronounced by Master Prowse on July 25, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Striking the Statement of Claim in this Action as against Hatch for want of jurisdiction; and/or</P1>
<P1>(c) Declaring that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and staying the Action as against all the Defendants in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at para 95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>9. Based on the text of its brief, Hatch also appears to take issue with the portion of Master Prowse's Order that imposed conditions on the stay that was granted and now seeks an unconditional stay of the whole of the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 60&ndash;68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Hatch has not filed the undertaking ordered, which it offered at the hearing below, and now appeals that as well.</P>
<P>10. KPCL, for its part, is asking this Court to:
<P1>(a) Set aside the Statement of Claim as against KPCL for want of jurisdiction; and/or</P1>
<P1>(b) Declare that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and stay this Action, potentially at the same time as requesting a transfer of the Action to Saskatchewan; or</P1>
<P1>(c) Declare that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and stay this Action and any Notice to Co-Defendant as against KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>11. Clifton, on the other hand, asks that either the whole of the Action be stayed or that an Order be granted transferring the entirety of the Action to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As noted above, this represents an expansion of the relief Clifton sought before Master Prowse, through which it asked for (and received) &ldquo;an Order staying [the Action] in its entirety against Clifton&rdquo;. This is, with respect, not an appeal but a fresh application, which is not consistent with the <EM>Rules of Court</EM>.</P>
<P>12. Intact failed to file any additional materials in connection with the appeal it launched, and CP is therefore uncertain of Intact's current position. That said, in its application before Master Prowse, Intact was seeking (and, like Clifton, received) an &ldquo;Order staying this action in its entirety against Intact&rdquo;. CP is unclear what relief Intact is now claiming. It was successful.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>No Proper Basis for these Appeals</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. Regardless of the specific relief sought by each of the Objecting Defendants, there is no proper basis for appeals by the Objecting Defendants, let alone a basis for this Honourable Court to allow any of the requested relief.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Appeal of Reasons is Unfounded</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. Aside from the nature of the appeal, which the parties agree is a <EM>de novo</EM> proceeding, an appeal pursuant to Rule 6.14 is no different than any other appellate proceeding, in that what is involved is an appeal <UNDER>of the order made</UNDER>. This is confirmed in the applicable Rule:
<QUOTE><P>If a master makes a judgment or order, the applicant or respondent to the application may appeal <UNDER>the judgment or order</UNDER> to a judge. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta. Reg. 124/2010, rule 6.14(1), <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. This parallels the authority conferred upon the Court of Appeal, which has jurisdiction pursuant to the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c. J-2, subject to the <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, to hear and determine appeals respecting a &ldquo;judgment, order or decision&rdquo;. As the Court of Appeal has confirmed, this provides the basis only for appeals of those aspects of a decision that form part of the formal order or judgment granted. The right of appeal to which this gives rise does not extend to &ldquo;[d]iscussions in the reasons for decision&rdquo; that are not included in the formal order that forms the basis of the appeal.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Stoney v 1985 Sawridge Trust</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 439</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. The fact that an appeal is from the judgment given, rather than the reasons a court provides to explain that decision is, moreover, a &ldquo;long-standing common law principle.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R v R.E.M.</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 51</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Indeed, the Court of Appeal has described a focus by the Court of Queen's Bench upon reasons given, as opposed to the judgment granted, in interpreting the decision of another judicial body as reflecting an &ldquo;error of law&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Chisholm v Lindsey</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 21</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Here, the Objecting Defendants are in effect appealing not Master Prowse's Order, but his underlying Reasons for Decision. Complaints regarding the Reasons for a Judgment do not form the proper basis for an appeal. Indeed, all four appeals are nothing more than responses to CP's appeal of Master Prowse's Order.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>The Objecting Defendants Consented to the Limitations Undertaking</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. A consent judgment will not be lightly set aside. Indeed, this Court has held that a consent judgment should be undone only if the party challenging it establishes exceptional circumstances, such as that consent was induced through fraud, deceit or mutual mistake.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lofthang v Canadian Immigration Specialists Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 609</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. In order to take the benefit of the stay that was granted, each of the Objecting Defendants was required to file &ldquo;an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Order at para 1, Record of Proceedings at Tab 4, page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a matter which the Objecting Defendants now appeal.</P>
<P>21. Yet the basis for the Order was an offer from the main Objecting Defendant, KPCL, which was adopted by others. They offered the relief. It was granted. Now they appeal.</P>
<P>22. During the hearing below, Master Prowse specifically asked:
<QUOTE><P>What do you do with the, if I were to give a stay, what do you do with the limitation problem that CP would have in Saskatchewan?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 31, lines 35 and 36, Record of Proceedings at page A989.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>23. In direct response to this question, counsel for KPCL made the following offer:
<QUOTE><P>Alternatively, in those circumstances, if and only if it is a tipping factor in this Court's mind and would otherwise have the Court refused to stay the action on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> grounds, KPCL <UNDER>would be amenable</UNDER> to an order that in effect provides the same thing as a transfer under the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceeding Transfer Act</EM> as it relates to limitations. <UNDER>That is, KPCL would be agreeable to an order that provides that KPCL would not assert that the CP claim is barred because of a limitation period if</UNDER>, and I'm quoting from the legislation, the claim would not be barred pursuant to the limitation rule that would be applied by the Alberta court. That's taken right from section 22 of the Saskatchewan legislation. And <UNDER>if necessary. Sir, if and only if necessary. KPCL would provide an undertaking not to rely on limitations in that manner or an undertaking to act consistent with that provision of the legislation</UNDER>.</P>
<P><UNDER>Of course. KPCL would want to be able to rely on any limitations defences that may have already existed in the Alberta court at the time that it was filed, as of December of 2017</UNDER>. (emphasis added)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 35, lines 22&ndash;36, Record of Proceedings at page A993.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. The offer by counsel for KPCL was then adopted by counsel for other Objecting Defendants, as follows:
<P1>(a) Clifton stated that it &ldquo;would rely upon the points which were made by [counsel for KPCL] with respect to ... the territorial competence and in the forum, ... the most appropriate forum analysis.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 46, lines 15&ndash;17, Record of Proceedings at page A1004.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) Hatch &ldquo;supported all submissions made by counsel for Clifton Associates Limited and counsel for Kelly Panteluk Construction Limited.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 49, lines 24 - 25, Record of Proceedings at page A1007.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>25. Having expressly offered to provide undertakings not to rely upon limitations defences that were not available within this Action, it is not now open to these parties to renege and argue that an unconditional stay is warranted.</P>
<P>26. Curiously, Hatch has submitted that it is unclear &ldquo;as to what will result if any of the Applicants choose not to file the undertaking in accordance with the Order.&rdquo;</P>
<P>27. It is difficult to understand how any confusion could arise from the clear wording of the Order, which states that:
<QUOTE><P>This action is stayed against KPCL, Clifton, Hatch and Intact, but only upon each of them filing an undertaking not to raise limitation defences against CP in Saskatchewan other than limitation defences which could have been raised against CP in these proceedings when they were commenced in Alberta on December 1, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jurisdiction Order at para 1, Record of Proceedings at page A1087.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Further, this Court need not speculate as to what might happen &ldquo;if any of the Applicants choose to not file the undertaking&rdquo; as each of the Objecting Defendants other than Hatch has complied with this direction. The effect of Hatch's failure to do so is obvious&mdash;in the absence of a filed undertaking, this Action is not stayed against Hatch. CP would, accordingly, be within its rights to demand a Statement of Defence from Hatch and to note Hatch in default if that was not forthcoming, although CP will not take such a step before this Honourable Court renders its decisions regarding these appeals.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. The issues surrounding jurisdiction <EM>simpiiciter</EM> and <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> were addressed in detail in CP's Appeal Brief and, for the most part, that material serves as full answer to the materials filed by the Objecting Defendants. The following is, accordingly, confined to responses to specific errors and inconsistencies within the materials filed by the Objecting Defendants.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Generally</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. The briefs filed on behalf of Clifton and KPCL rely upon a shared mistake in respect of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> and <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Both assert that in assessing issues of jurisdiction, the Court must consider jurisdiction in respect of <UNDER>each defendant</UNDER>, as opposed to considering jurisdiction over the action <UNDER>as a whole</UNDER>. That is simply wrong and would lead to tautological results.</P>
<P>31. Clifton, for example, argues that:
<QUOTE><P>The court's decision should be governed by determining whether the court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over each of the defendants [and whether] it is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> for each of the defendants ...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. KPCL, for its part, explicitly claims that the &ldquo;jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> analysis is meant to ensure that a court has jurisdiction over each individual defendant in an action&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 40.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and argues that the Statement of Claim should be set aside as against KPCL for want of jurisdiction. In support of this proposition, KPCL cites paragraph 27 of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz v Goldhar</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at footnote 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That paragraph, with respect, says nothing of the sort and, indeed, contradicts KPCL's assertion.</P>
<P>33. The entirety of that paragraph of Justice C&oc;t&ea;'s decision sets out the following guidance regarding the meaning of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>Central to a proper understanding of the conflicts rules of Canadian private international law, and to the resolution of this appeal, is an appreciation of the distinct roles played by jurisdiction simpliciter and forum non conveniens ... <UNDER>The jurisdiction simpliciter analysis is meant to ensure that a court has jurisdiction. This will be the case where a &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; exists between a chosen forum and the subject matter of the litigation.</UNDER> The forum non conveniens analysis, on the other hand, is meant to guide courts in determining whether they should decline to exercise that jurisdiction in favour of a &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo; forum. (citations omitted, emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD> (excerpt only, full text of the decision included in the Authorities accompanying CP's Appeal Brief at Tab 4)</P1></P>
<P>34. Similarly, as outlined in CP's Appeal Brief, a proper assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> looks at the action as a whole, rather than at the specifics of each cause of action alleged or at the claims as against each party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 142.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. When the applicable law is properly considered, the result, as outlined in CP's Appeal Brief, should be a finding that the Alberta courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this Action and should exercise that discretion given the absence of evidence sufficient to establish Saskatchewan as the <UNDER>clearly</UNDER> more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER>Forum Selection Clauses</UNDER></TI>
<P>36. Both Hatch and Clifton contractually attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts (from which they now resile) and such agreements should be given significant weight in assessing whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 88&ndash;100.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The mischief that would otherwise entail would be serious in preserving the sanctity of contracts and agreements.</P>
<P>37. In its written submissions, Clifton appears to ignore its contractual attornment, which is obviously inconvenient to its position, in favour of attempting to explain why this Honourable Court has the authority to stay the whole of this Action. This should not be the starting point of Clifton's argument. As a first step, this Honourable Court should seek an explanation from Clifton as to why it should be permitted to avoid its contractual obligations. Absent such an explanation, Clifton should be held to its agreement and this Court should decline to hear further from Clifton with respect to forum.</P>
<P>38. Similarly, Hatch expressly seeks to avoid the ramifications of its contractual obligations, relying upon a strained interpretation of the attornment provision in its contract with CP that was expressly rejected by Master Prowse, and to CP's knowledge, has never been adopted or accepted by a court in Canada.</P>
<P>39. This approach would, if adopted, render contractual forum selection provisions meaningless. Instead of requiring parties to keep to their bargains, thus affording certainty to those parties about the forum in which their disputes would be litigated, jurisdiction would depend solely upon the parties preferences and a <EM>post hoc</EM> assessment. Such an outcome is inconsistent not only with the law of contract generally, but with the jurisprudence confirming the importance of ensuring that parties uphold their agreements as to forum selection, even if such agreements are later seen by those parties as potentially inconvenient.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 88&ndash;100.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Comparative Convenience</UNDER></TI>
<P>40. For the reasons set out in CP's Appeal Brief, the formalistic exercise of counting the heads of potential witnesses to assess comparative convenience should be given little weight, especially in the early stages of a proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at para 152.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. In this case, the corporate representatives (non lawyers) of both KPCL and Clifton have opined about which of their respective employees CP will want to question,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 at para 78, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1(i), pages A7 and A19ff; Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 at paras 22 and 24, Record of Proceedings at Tab (l)(iii), page A305 and A306.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and it is upon the basis of those lists that they assert that the number of witnesses in Saskatchewan &ldquo;overwhelmingly supports&rdquo; Saskatchewan as the most appropriate forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 113.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. On the other hand, CP's counsel has, on a preliminary basis, arrived at quite different conclusions about which witnesses are likely to be questioned.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016, Exhibit 17, Record of Proceedings at Tab 1 (vi), page A781.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. It is difficult to prepare even preliminary lists of potential witnesses in advance of document production, and the prospect of identifying likely trial witnesses with any certainty at this stage is illusory. Notably, though, the list of potential witnesses prepared by KPCL appears to contain a number of people whose utility as potential witnesses is dubious at best, such as its Human Resources Manager and an HSE Coordinator. This list should be seen for what it is&mdash;a straw man constructed to bolster KPCL's arguments on jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage and Prejudice</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. Despite having offered the undertaking with respect to limitations as a means to redress the loss of juridical advantage to CP stemming from the potential effect of limitation periods in Saskatchewan, the Objecting Defendants now seek an unconditional stay of this entire Action (even against two Defendants that have defended), asking this Court to ignore the prejudice arising from CP's loss of juridical advantage.</P>
<P>45. Within this Action, CP enjoys the juridical advantage of having filed its Statement of Claim within the relevant limitation period, and having fulsome rights of discovery.</P>
<P>46. The Objecting Defendants baldly assert that CP's decision not to commence proceedings in Saskatchewan within the limitation period was unreasonable, with the suggested result being that CP should be penalized by a stay of this Action and the attendant potential exposure to limitations defences if it must proceed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 160; Hatch Brief at para 60.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. The suggestion that commencing this Action in Alberta was unreasonable cannot&mdash;in the face of the contractual attornment provisions that are in place&mdash;be given any credence, especially when advanced by Hatch, which agreed through its contract with CP to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>48. Such an argument would, moreover, require prescience on the part of plaintiffs. Modem complex commercial litigation almost invariably involves parties situated across a number of jurisdictions. The approach advocated by the Objecting Defendants would require that a plaintiff sue in the jurisdiction that the courts eventually determine is clearly more appropriate or, perhaps, sue in every plausible jurisdiction, to ensure that it is not vulnerable to limitations defences in a jurisdiction in which it did not initiate claims. Neither approach ought to be countenanced by this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>49. The gamesmanship regarding limitation periods that has been at work since this Action was served is more transparent with these appeals.</P>
<P>50. During the proceedings before Master Prowse, KPCL's counsel assured the Court that:
<QUOTE><P>KPCL's intention was not motivated by seeking to have this matter move to Saskatchewan, to force CP to sue in Saskatchewan, and then claim the limitation period has expired between the date of filing the Alberta action and the date of filing the Saskatchewan action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at page 34, lines 24&ndash;27, Record of Proceedings at page A992.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>51. Clifton appears to have taken the position that Alberta limitations periods would continue to apply if this Action is transferred to Saskatchewan, with its counsel stating:
<QUOTE><P>With respect to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, I think ... with respect to any concerns about the limitation time periods that would be in flux or be in play, section 22 of that legislation clearly sets out how things were to, are to operate with respect to the acceptance of a, of an action transferred into Saskatchewan, and the language is clear with regard to the importation of the limitation period compliance or not. It seems to clearly accept that the facts are taken into that jurisdiction to apply the law that was, that was in play with respect to the issuance of the claim initially in the, in the host jurisdiction, the first jurisdiction, which in this case would be Alberta.</P>
<P>From our, from our perspective as an applicant, Clifton does not see it as an issue with respect to limitation periods and it should not be seen to be a block or a concern on the part of this Court to be hesitant to consider the whole argument with regard to the necessity, the reasons, the proper reason for the matter, the proper circumstance that this be taken to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018 at pages 46 - 47, lines 34 - 17, Record of Proceedings at pages A1004 - A1005.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>52. At the time, Hatch adopted those submissions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of Proceedings July 4, 2018, at page 49, lines 24 - 25, Record of Proceedings at A1007.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Now, however, the positions of the Objecting Defendants are inconsistent, with Hatch expressly taking a very different tack.</P>
<P>53. Hatch, at least, is transparent in its position&mdash;it not only believes it has limitations defences available to it in Saskatchewan, but plans to make full use of such defences.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 48, 59 and 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, it has refused to file an undertaking in accordance with Master Prowse's Order and openly muses in its brief about defying the Order. In fact, Hatch is keen to pursue limitation defences should this Action be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan. In its submissions, Hatch expressly warns that it will &ldquo;undoubtedly&rdquo; make limitations arguments based on its &ldquo;legitimate defence of limitations in Saskatchewan&rdquo; and, in what is surely a remarkable statement from the mouth of a party that contractually attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts, asserts that any restriction upon its right to raise such defences would &ldquo;prejudice Hatch's rightful entitlement to a jurisdictional advantage in Saskatchewan&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 48, 59 and 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. KPCL and Clifton have not been as transparent&mdash;each of them seeks a stay of the entire action and/or a transfer of the whole to Saskatchewan. Neither of them, however, have expressed a position with respect to reliance upon limitation periods in Saskatchewan should a transfer occur.</P>
<P>55. It cannot seriously be suggested that CP will not be prejudiced if forced into Saskatchewan and required to contend with limitations defences that were unavailable to the defendants in this Action. Accordingly, the loss of juridical advantage to CP if this Action is either stayed or transferred in a manner that would preserve limitations defences available in Saskatchewan that are not available in Alberta is a factor that should weigh heavily in the assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Procedural Considerations</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. For the first time, as part of these appeals, the Objecting Defendants seek to stay not only CP's claims as against themselves but also as against Thurber and Altus (both of whom have defended). In addition, KPCL seeks to stay the Notices of Co-Defendants filed by Thurber and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>As outlined above, the initial applications made by Clifton and Intact sought to stay the Action only against those parties. The applications filed by Hatch and KPCL sought a stay. None of the parties sought a stay of the Notices filed by Thurber and Altus.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If granted, such an Order would have a significant effect on Thurber and Altus. It would, moreover, have that effect without allowing even the benefit of notice to either of them, as affected parties, that such relief would be sought.</P>
<P>57. Further, KPCL continues to assert that the fact that it was &ldquo;first-to-file&rdquo; should be given &ldquo;some weight&rdquo; in this Court's analysis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 148.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is, with respect, unsupportable in these circumstances. In <CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE></CASEREF>, the sole authority KPCL has provided for this proposition, the first claim was not only filed <UNDER>but served</UNDER> and a Statement of Defence had been filed before a parallel proceeding in another jurisdiction was commenced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>At footnote 285 of the KPCL Brief. KPCL cites two decisions: <CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Colonial Countertops Ltd v Maple Terrazzo Marble &amp; Tile Incorporated</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 752</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Colonial Countertops</EM>&rdquo;) at paras 75 - 76 for this proposition. <EM>Colonial Countertops</EM> does not appear to speak to this point.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While the Court referenced the &ldquo;first-to-file&rdquo; element, it appears to have been the fact that the first action was &ldquo;further along&rdquo; that was weighed in deciding which forum was most appropriate.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 7</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>58. KPCL cannot be allowed to rely on a filed but unserved claim to assert that Saskatchewan is the most appropriate forum, which essentially would allow a party to hedge its bets and lie in the weeds, if it is sued elsewhere. Adopting this approach would merely serve to encourage early filing of potentially duplicative claims in multiple jurisdictions by parties seeking to anchor future arguments regarding jurisdiction in the event those arose.</P>
<P>59. This Action, while filed later, was &ldquo;further along&rdquo; than KPCL's Saskatchewan Action at the time KPCL sought to challenge jurisdiction, with CP's claim having been served upon all of the parties while KPCL's claim remained unserved. This Action remains &ldquo;further along&rdquo;, with two Defendants having filed Statement of Defence and with this Honourable Court now hearing appeals in respect of Master Prowse's Order on jurisdiction. In KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, nothing beyond service of the Statement of Claim and CP's application for a stay of the need to file a Statement of Defence has transpired.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>Multiplicity of Actions</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. It appears to be common ground amongst the parties that a multiplicity of actions is to be avoided.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at paras 71 and 72; Clifton Brief at para 28; KPCL Brief at para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. In pressing their arguments about the importance of avoiding a multiplicity of actions, however, Hatch, Clifton and KPCL&mdash;in a manner that is at best disingenuous&mdash;all submit that multiplicity of actions is an <UNDER>effect</UNDER> of Master Prowse's Order. For example, the following submissions, amongst others, have been made:
<P1>(a) &ldquo;The existing Order ... will create a multiplicity of proceedings.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Brief at para 59.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;If the Alberta Action is permitted to proceed, it will create a multiplicity of proceedings...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at para 131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;The partial stay granted by the Learned Master will likely give rise to a multiplicity of proceedings.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>62. These arguments are misguided. Master Prowse's Order did not <UNDER>create</UNDER> the current multiplicity of actions&mdash;that existed at the time KPCL first indicated that it would be challenging jurisdiction (although KPCL had not yet made CP aware that it had filed a separate claim in Saskatchewan.) And, remarkably, after the applications regarding jurisdiction were underway, KPCL then chose to file yet another action in Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably for the purpose of buttressing its position on jurisdiction by allowing it to argue that Saskatchewan was clearly a more appropriate forum for its (new) <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM> claim. Such a transparent attempt to bootstrap the position of the Objecting Defendants with respect to the jurisdiction should not, with respect, be allowed to succeed.</P>
<P>63. Arguments based upon the KPCL Originating Application establishing Saskatchewan as the clearly more appropriate forum must be rejected for the reasons set out in CP's Appeal Brief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Appeal Brief at paras 171 - 172.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. Moreover, this argument is inconsistent with KPCL's own position regarding the Originating Application. KPCL's asserts that the Originating Application has been heard, with the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan having reserved its decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief at paras 35 and 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP takes issue with this position and maintains that it has not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan courts, let alone responded substantively to proceedings there. If, however, if it were the case that the Originating Application had been heard, according to KPCL's own logic the existence of the Originating Application&mdash;having already been heard by the Honourable Mr. Justice D. C. Chow with only a decision needed to complete the proceeding&mdash;would be irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction over this Action.</P>
<P>65. In essence, there are two scenarios open to the Court if multiplicity is truly to be avoided.</P>
<P>66. The first is to ignore the general principle that a Court that has jurisdiction over a claim should exercise that jurisdiction absent exceptional circumstances. As well, it would require one to ignore the forum selection clauses which both Hatch and Clifton agreed to as part of their contracts with CP. Finally, the nature of the process that might effect this result is uncertain, but would likely require crafting some sort of remedy moving this Action to Saskatchewan, perhaps through incorporating this Action into the KPCL Saskatchewan Action by way of Counterclaim or through a transfer of the whole to Saskatchewan through a request from this Court. Neither of these approaches offers certainty in respect of CP's position vis-&ag;vis limitations and, depending on how the move were accomplished (assuming it could be), further issues in respect of how Thurber and Altus would become parties to the Saskatchewan matter would likely arise, including additional questions with respect to the applicable limitation periods.</P>
<P>67. The second option is simple: one party, KPCL, pursues the matters at issue in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action and the KPCL Originating Application (assuming, contrary to KPCL's position, that the Originating Application has not yet been heard) as part of this Action. This would provide a fair result as well as an efficient means of addressing the existing multiplicity. All of the likely parties are already before this Honourable Court&mdash;as opposed to only two who are presently parties to KPCL's actions in Saskatchewan&mdash;and none are disadvantaged by having to face limitations defences with respect to claims, cross-claims and third party claims that could arise in Saskatchewan to the potential prejudice of not only CP but the other parties who would be new to a Saskatchewan action.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>68. In addition to the relief sought through its own appeal in respect of Master Prowse's Order, CP requests that this Honourable Court dismiss the appeals filed by the Objecting Defendants and grant costs in respect of these appeals to CP in any event of the cause, payable forthwith.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY BRIEF OF HATCH CORPORATION FOR SPECIAL APPLICATION IN JUSTICE CHAMBERS SCHEDULED FOR December 3-4, 2018</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>REPLY OF THE HATCH CORPORATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This is the Reply of the Defendant/Respondent, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;), to the brief of the Plaintiff/Appellant, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;), filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;CP Appeal Brief&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. In full reply to the Appeal Brief of CP, Hatch repeats and relies upon its submissions as set out in the Appeal Brief of Hatch filed on November 16, 2018 (the &ldquo;Hatch Appeal Brief&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. However, while Hatch takes issue with many of CP's submissions in the CP Appeal Brief, Hatch seeks to clarify certain specific matters stated by CP.</P>
<P>4. In response to paragraph 21 of the CP Appeal Brief, CP incorrectly states
<QUOTE><P>[...] Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia. [...]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>5. In support of this statement, CP cites the Response to the Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch (the &ldquo;Response&rdquo;). The document CP attached as Tab 12 to Ms. Mcardles's Affidavit filed June 22, 2018 is partial, missing the third page thereof. The Response actually states that a total of four of the ten employees identified were either not in Alberta or relocated outside of Alberta during the period in which Hatch was performing its work.
<P1>Response to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, filed June 19, 2018 at paras 2-3, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>6. In response to paragraphs 190 and 191 of the CP Appeal Brief, Hatch at no time has offered to undertake not to rely upon a limitations defence in Saskatchewan. As discussed at paragraphs 60 to 68 of the Hatch Appeal Brief, Hatch respectfully submits Master J.T. Prowse erred in requiring Hatch to file such an undertaking to stay CP's action in Alberta.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>REMEDY SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Hatch respectfully seeks the following relief:
<P1>(a) An Order dismissing the Appeal of CP;</P1>
<P1>(b) An Order setting aside the Order of Master Prowse pronounced on July 25, 2018, filed on August 16, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) An Order striking the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, CP as against the Defendant, Hatch for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>(d) Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order unconditionally staying this action as against all Defendants in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(e) Costs of this application on a Solicitor and his own client, full indemnity basis; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 23<SUP>rd</SUP> day of November, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF KELLY PANTELUK Sworn on February 7, 2018</TI>
<P>I, Kelly Panteluk, of Estevan, Saskatchewan, SWEAR AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the President of the Defendant Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;). I have held this position since the incorporation of KPCL in 1984.</P>
<P>2. I worked for Panteluk Construction, which was owned and operated by my father, prior to incorporating KPCL as a new business in 1984.</P>
<P>3. I have reviewed the Statement of Claim in this action, which was filed on December 1, 2017.</P>
<P>4. This action relates to work performed by KPCL and other parties at the request of the Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), with respect to the construction of a new, 30.4-km railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo; located between CP's existing Kalium Spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, and the K+S potash mine near Findlater, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). Based on my dealings with the Project, I believe that all matters relating to the action and the Project occurred between 2014 and the present date.</P>
<P>5. I was personally involved with the Project and had a supervisory role in the preparation of submissions to CP for the Project, the negotiation of the contract governing the relationship between CP and KPCL and the execution of KPCL's responsibilities relating to the Project. I was very actively involved in the Project, including personally dealing with CP and attending weekly meetings with respect to the Project.</P>
<P>6. As a result of the foregoing, I have personal knowledge of the matters and facts herein deposed, except where stated to be based upon information and belief, in which case I believe the same to be true. I am authorized by KPCL to swear this Affidavit.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>KPCL</TI>
<P>7. Panteluk Construction was a private company founded in 1953 by my father. After working at Panteluk Construction for a number of years, I founded KPCL in 1984. KPCL is a private, family-owned and operated corporation and is in the business of providing earth moving and excavation services in the Province of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>8. KPCL is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Saskatchewan and its registered office is in Estevan, Saskatchewan. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of a Saskatchewan corporate registry search of KPCL.</P>
<P>9. KPCL's head office is located in Estevan, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Estevan Office</BOLD>&rdquo;). KPCL also has a satellite office located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. All KPCL matters relating to the Project were handled through the Estevan Office.</P>
<P>10. All of KPCL's current operations occur within the Province of Saskatchewan. At all relevant times, all of KPCL's operations have been located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>11. KPCL has not carried on any work in Alberta since 1995.</P>
<P>12. KPCL did not have any personnel operating on behalf of KPCL in Alberta at any relevant time. KPCL does not and has never had a business office located in Alberta and it has had no other physical presence in Alberta whatsoever during the relevant time.</P>
<P>13. KPCL has approximately 50 permanent employees throughout the year and hires additional employees and contractors during the peak time for construction during the summer months. During the summer months, KPCL generally hires approximately 250 employees or contractors. During the time period of the Project, KPCL employed close to 300 individuals. Approximately 200 of those individuals were working on the Project at the site of the Project, in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>14. The vast majority of KPCL's permanent and seasonal employees are based in Saskatchewan. The following is a chart summarizing the residence of all KPCL employees for 2015&ndash;2017 by Province which was generated from KPCL's payroll information at my request:

<P>15. None of the permanent staff of KPCL are currently based in Alberta or were based in Alberta at any relevant time.</P>
<P>16. All of the management personnel of KPCL have always been based in Saskatchewan, and were so during the course of the Project. I live and work in Estevan, Saskatchewan. Scott Manson, KPCL's Chief Operating Officer lives and works in Estevan, Saskatchewan. Riley Panteluk, the Construction Supervisor for the Project, lives and works in Estevan, Saskatchewan. Evan Powell, the Project Manager for the Project, lives near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>17. During the course of the Project, KPCL carried out all of its business and undertook all its management decisions relating to the Project out of the Estevan Office. This remains true today and is expected to remain the case for the duration of the litigation brought by CP.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Negotiation of the CP-KPCL Contract</TI>
<P>18. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats of Borden Ladner Gervais LLP and believe that CP is a Canadian corporation that is extra-provincially registered in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;4&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches from Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Canadian corporate registries that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel Borden Ladner Gervais.</P>
<P>19. I personally dealt with a number of CP employees prior to the commencement of construction on the Project. To the best of my recollection and knowledge, the names of those employees, their titles and residences during the time I dealt with them are as follows:
<P1>(a) Glenn Whitham&mdash;Speciality Sourcing Engineer, Mississauga Ontario;</P1>
<P1>(b) Chris Bunce&mdash;Chief Engineer Projects, Calgary, Alberta;</P1>
<P1>(c) Stephen Cross&mdash;Director Engineering Projects West, Calgary, Alberta;</P1>
<P1>(d) Martin Quintell&mdash;Purchasing Department, Calgary, Alberta;</P1>
<P1>(e) Brent Lang&mdash;Vice President Engineering, Calgary, Alberta; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Scott MacDonald&mdash;Vice President, Operations, Calgary, Alberta.</P1></P>
<P>20. In 2014, KPCL became aware of a Request for Qualifications (&ldquo;<BOLD>RFQ</BOLD>&rdquo;) issued by CP for performing excavation and grading work with respect to the Project.</P>
<P>21. The RFQ provided that for any inquiries, only the project contract person for CP could be contacted. The RFQ identifies Glenn Whitham as the project contact person for the Project. Based on my personal dealings with Glenn Whitham, I am aware that during this time he was based out of the Mississauga, Ontario office of CP, and he continues to be based in Ontario.</P>
<P>22. I was personally involved in supervising the preparation of a response to the RFQ and subsequently in the preparation of two separate request for proposals (the &ldquo;<BOLD>RFPs</BOLD>&rdquo;) for the Project (the second RFP being required as CP cancelled the first RFP).</P>
<P>23. All of KPCL's work involved in preparing the RFQ and the RFPs was done in the Estevan Office and all correspondence with CP relating to the RFQ and RFPs was through Glenn Whitham of CP's Mississauga office, with the exception of one meeting held in Calgary, Alberta. This was the sole meeting held in Alberta that was attended by KPCL during the RFP and RFQ process with respect to the Project.</P>
<P>24. On March 12, 2015, I received a letter of intent from Glenn Whitham of CP's Mississauga office indicating that CP wished to enter into a binding agreement with KPCL for the Project, subject to CP receiving a permit from the Canadian Transportation Agency (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Letter of Intent</BOLD>&rdquo;). In the interim, KPCL was given approval to bring equipment from the Estevan yard to the site in order to get ahead of the spring road bans and to potentially start some clearing and grubbing to get ahead of the return of migratory birds. I signed the Letter of Intent in the Estevan Office and sent the letter back to Glenn Whitham in Mississauga by email on March 14, 2015. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;5&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the March 14, 2015 cover email and letter.</P>
<P>25. Between April 9, 2015 and May 11, 2015, KPCL and CP negotiated the terms of a draft agreement. Any changes made by KPCL were made in the Estevan Office. Revised versions of the draft agreement were sent to KPCL from CP from its Mississauga office.</P>
<P>26. On May 15, 2015, Glenn Whitham forwarded the final Supply of Services Agreement to me for execution. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;6&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of that email.</P>
<P>27. On May 20, 2015, I signed the Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) at my office in Estevan, Saskatchewan. Evan Powell sent the KPCL Contract to Glenn Whitham at CP's Mississauga office. I was copied on that email. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;7&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of that email.</P>
<P>28. On May 25, 2015, Glenn Whitham forwarded a copy of the KPCL Contract that was signed by Scott MacDonald, CP's Senior VP, Operations System. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;8&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of that email and the fully executed KPCL Contract.</P>
<P>29. KPCL, under the supervision of myself and Scott Manson, took steps to obtain the insurance policies and the performance for the Project, bonds as requested by CP.</P>
<P>30. KPCL obtained insurance policies and performance bonds related to the Project through Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;). Marsh obtained the performance bonds through the Defendant Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>31. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that the Defendant, Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), is an insurance company incorporated under the <EM>Saskatchewan Insurance Act</EM>. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;9&rdquo;, &ldquo;10&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;11&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches for Intact from the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canadian registries, respectively, that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel. These search results indicate that Intact is not registered in the Canadian or Alberta corporate registries. Intact has an office located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>32. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that Marsh is a Canadian corporation. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;12&rdquo;, &ldquo;13&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;14&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches from the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canadian registries, respectively, that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel. Marsh has offices across Canada, including in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>33. Barry Shelton, an employee of Marsh, was KPCL's primary point of contact at Marsh. Based on my dealings with him and with respect to the Project, I believe Barry Shelton works and resides in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. All my dealings, and to the best of my knowledge all of KPCL's dealings, with Mr. Shelton with respect to the Project were in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>34. KPCL also dealt with Maureen Matheson from Marsh in the procurement of insurance. Based on my dealings with her and with respect to the Project, I believe Maureen Matheson works and resides in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. All my dealings, and to the best of my knowledge all of KPCL's dealings, with Ms. Matheson with respect to the Project were in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>35. Based on my dealings with respect to the Project, I know CP uses ISNetworld to ensure its suppliers comply with insurance requirements. ISNetworld is a global company with a head office located in Dallas, Texas that provides review and monitoring services for insurance and safety requirements. ISNetworld has been used by owners on other projects in the past that KPCL has worked on, and KPCL is familiar with the format and services it provides.</P>
<P>36. CP identified the required insurance coverage on the ISNetworld website. I am advised by KPCL's Scott Manson and believe that KPCL uploaded the certificates to the ISNetworld online site from the Estevan Office.</P>
<P>37. On May 29, 2015, Marsh's Saskatchewan office provided a labour and material bond (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Labour and Materials Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;) and a performance bond (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;) to me that were issued by Intact after confirmation from CP's Stephen Cross that the performance bonds would be required. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;15&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of the email and attachment sent from Marsh to KPCL which includes the Labour and Materials Bond and the Performance Bond.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>KPCL's Work on The Project</TI>
<P>38. The Project was and is entirely located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>39. KPCL's scope of work on the Project was modified from time to time. The initial scope of KPCL's work included the following, all of which was to be performed in Saskatchewan and involved Saskatchewan land:
<P1>(a) construction of a railway grade;</P1>
<P1>(b) construction of a multi-plate structure carrying a roadway over the railway grade;</P1>
<P1>(c) construction of a river crossing consisting of a single-span steel girder bridge and associated foundations and abutments;</P1>
<P1>(d) utility modifications and protection;</P1>
<P1>(e) construction of a concrete conveyance structure; and</P1>
<P1>(f) roadway modifications.</P1></P>
<P>40. The modifications to the scope of the Project included, among other things, the elimination of the bridge from the scope of work and the removal of the auxiliary conveyance structure. None of the modifications required any work by KPCL to occur outside of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>41. All work performed by KPCL related to the Project occurred in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Foundation Failure</TI>
<P>42. Based on my involvement in the Project and regular communication with KPCL employees, CP and Clifton, I am aware that on or about December 5, 2015, there was a failure of the foundation for the Project at approximately STA 24+000 to 24+700 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Foundation Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>43. I was first notified of the Foundation Failure by Riley Panteluk, KPCL's Construction Supervisor. Riley Panteluk advised me that the Foundation Failure was initially discovered by KPCL employee Murray Reimer (a rock truck driver) on the site of the Project, in Saskatchewan. Murray Reimer contacted James Karcha (KPCL Site Superintendent). James Karcha then contacted Riley Panteluk and Al Wilde (a Clifton employee) who subsequently notified others involved with the Project, including CP.</P>
<P>44. In the 2016 construction season, I and KPCL dealt with some new or replacement CP employees who had not previously been involved in the Project, including Darcey Hormann (replacement for Stephen Cross), Jonathan Bower (replacement for Gary Gao) and Justin Meyers (replacement for Chris Bunce). Based on my dealings with Darcey Hormann, I believe he currently works in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Based on my dealings with Justin Meyers, I believe he currently works in Calgary, Alberta. Based on my dealings with Jonathan Bower, I believe he currently works in Montreal, Quebec. We also had limited dealings with Scott McDonald, of Calgary, Alberta after the Foundation Failure.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>CP</TI>
<P>45. Based on my personal involvement in this matter, and based on the direction I received from CP's Chris Bunce, Stephen Cross, and Darcey Hormann, I believe CP provided, among other things, project management/oversight as well as direction regarding design changes and modifications, change orders, invoicing direction, budget and financial management, scheduling, archeological investigation and monitoring and dealt with various regulatory and environmental compliance matters.</P>
<P>46. CP personnel were present on the site throughout the Project. The primary individuals from CP involved in the Project on a day-to-day basis, and their titles and roles at the time of the Project (to the best of my knowledge), were:
<P1>(a) Hui (Gary) Gao&mdash;Project Manager, Engineer;</P1>
<P1>(b) Ernie Bateman&mdash;Construction Manager;</P1>
<P1>(c) Jonathon Bower&mdash;Project Manager, K+S;</P1>
<P1>(d) Chris Bunce&mdash;Chief Engineer Projects;</P1>
<P1>(e) Stephen Cross&mdash;Director Engineering Projects; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Darcey Hormann&mdash;Project Director, K+S</P1>
(the &ldquo;<BOLD>Key CP Employees</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>47. Based on my dealings on the Project, I believe that the Key CP Employees will be important witnesses in this matter.</P>
<P>48. I personally attended weekly design meetings relating to the Project with other KPCL employees, representatives from Clifton, CP, Hatch and other contractors and subcontractors working on the Project. These meetings all took place in Saskatchewan in Clifton's Regina office, or at the site of the Project, or by teleconference with KPCL attending in Saskatchewan. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;16&rdquo;</BOLD> are a sample of meeting minutes from weekly design meetings for the Project.</P>
<P>49. I personally attended weekly project construction meetings relating to the Project with other employees of KPCL, representatives from Clifton, CP and other contractors and subcontractors working on the Project. These meetings all took place in Saskatchewan, predominately on the site of the Project. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;17&rdquo;</BOLD> are a sample of meeting minutes from weekly project construction meetings for the Project.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;)</TI>
<P>50. Based on my dealings on the Project, and my personal dealings with Clifton, I am aware that Clifton was retained by CP in relation to the Project. I, along with others at KPCL, worked directly with Clifton on parts of the Project.</P>
<P>51. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that Clifton is a Canadian corporation with its registered office in Regina, Saskatchewan. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;18&rdquo;, &ldquo;19&rdquo; and &ldquo;20&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches of Clifton from the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canada corporate registries, respectively, that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel. I know that Clifton has offices in Saskatchewan including offices in Saskatoon, Regina and North Battleford.</P>
<P>52. Based on my dealings on the Project, I understood that the scope of Clifton's work on the Project, among other things, included supervising and directing the work and quality control. Clifton managed and monitored the Project at the site and from its head office in Regina.</P>
<P>53. The Clifton employees that I personally dealt with, and I am informed by KPCL's Scott Manson and Riley Panteluk and believe others at KPCL dealt with, during the course of the Project were the following, all of whom worked out of Clifton's Regina office and at the site of the Project:
<P1>(a) Wayne Clifton&mdash;Principal, who I understand was involved in oversight and resolving geotechnical issues and who occasionally visited the Project site;</P1>
<P1>(b) Jasyn Henry&mdash;Geotechnical Engineer, who I understand was responsible for oversight on the installation of project instrumentation, monitoring of instruments, and interpretation of results;</P1>
<P1>(c) Al Wilde&mdash;Senior Civil Engineer on site, who I understand was responsible for day-to-day supervision and direction for the Project on behalf of Clifton, quality control, and issuing daily progress reports to CP;</P1>
<P1>(d) Derek Hoffart&mdash;Geotechnical Engineer;</P1>
<P1>(e) Brian Snow&mdash;Construction Manager, who I understand was involved with day-today operations on the site of the Project and directly reporting to Al Wilde;</P1>
<P1>(f) Kyle Mason&mdash;Geotechnical Engineer, who I understand was involved in geotechnical monitoring; and</P1>
<P1>(g) Heather Duncan&mdash;Administrative, who I understand attended most construction meetings</P1>
(the &ldquo;<BOLD>Key Clifton Employees</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>54. KPCL primarily dealt with Clifton on the site of the Project but also attended a number of meetings relating to the Project at Clifton's office in Regina, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>55. Based on my knowledge of the Project and Clifton's involvement, I believe the Key Clifton Employees are located in Saskatchewan and will likely be important witnesses in this matter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;)</TI>
<P>56. Based on my dealings on the Project, and my personal dealings with Hatch, I am aware that CP retained Hatch to prepare the engineering design, issue construction drawings and assist with the management of the Project.</P>
<P>57. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Ontario. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;21&rdquo;, &ldquo;22&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;23&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches of Hatch from the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario corporate registries, respectively, that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel. Based on my personal dealings with Hatch, I know it is a global company and has offices in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>58. The Hatch employees that I personally dealt with, and I am advised by KPCL's Scott Manson and Riley Panteluk and believe that others at KPCL dealt with, during the course of the Project were Andrew Paton (Hatch Project Manager) and Angus Kennedy (Senior Project Engineer).</P>
<P>59. Other than the occasional visit to site by Andrew Paton and later by Angus Kennedy, most of KPCL's dealing with Hatch took place over the phone either at the design meetings, by e-mail or over specific phone calls.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;Thurber&rdquo;)</TI>
<P>60. Based on my dealings on the Project, I believe that Thurber performed geotechnical work, including among other things, geotechnical investigations and recommendations for the Project.</P>
<P>61. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that Thurber is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;24&rdquo;, &ldquo;25&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;26&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of the results of corporate registry searches of Thurber from Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan corporate registries, respectively that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel. Based on my experience, Thurber has offices across Canada including in Saskatoon.</P>
<P>62. KPCL did not have any direct involvement with any Thurber employees or with Thurber generally. I am not aware of the identity of the Thurber employees that were involved in the Project or their roles or locations.</P>
<P>63. Based on my knowledge of the Project and Thurber's involvement, I believe that Thurber employees will likely be important witnesses in this matter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;Altus&rdquo;)</TI>
<P>64. Based on my dealings on the Project, and my personal dealings with Altus, I am aware that CP used Altus to perform survey services for the Project, including site survey control, layout of the project and measurement for payment, among possible other things outside of my or KPCL's knowledge.</P>
<P>65. All of my direct contact, and to my knowledge based on my involvement with the Project, all of KPCL's direct contact, with Altus was with individuals from Altus' Regina office.</P>
<P>66. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe that Altus is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;27&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;28&rdquo;</BOLD> are the results of corporate searches of Altus from the Alberta and Saskatchewan corporate registries, respectively, that I am advised by Leanne Desbarats and believe were obtained by KPCL's legal counsel.</P>
<P>67. The Altus employees that I personally dealt with, and I am advised by KPCL's Scott Manson and Riley Panteluk and believe that the Altus employees that others at KPCL dealt with, during the course of the Project were the following individuals who worked out of the Regina office:
<P1>(a) Prakhar Shrivastava&mdash;Project Manager, who I understood was responsible for managing Altus' work on the Project;</P1>
<P1>(b) Joey McDonald&mdash;Lead Surveyor, who I understood was responsible for Altus' day-to-day operations on the site of the Project;</P1>
<P1>(c) Aaron Bitterman&mdash;Surveyor, who I understood was responsible for Altus' survey work on the Project; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Dave Gumsey&mdash;Regina office manager, who I understood was responsible for day-to-day office management at the Altus Regina office</P1>
(the &ldquo;<BOLD>Key Altus Employees</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>68. All of KPCL's dealings with Altus took place at the Project site in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>69. Based on my knowledge of the Project and Altus' involvement, I believe the Key Altus Employees will likely be important witnesses in this matter and are currently located in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>KPCL's Saskatchewan Statement of Claim</TI>
<P>70. On or about 28 August 2017, KPCL filed an action against CP in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (Regina Judicial Centre, file no. QBG2177/17) seeking compensation of over $17 million in damages for delay and impact costs for which CP is liable to compensate KPCL, including costs arising out of work performed post Foundation Failure (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Claim</BOLD>&rdquo;). Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;29&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the KPCL Claim.</P>
<P>71. I am advised by Leanne Desbarats of Borden Ladner Gervais LLP and believe that CP has been served, or is in the process of being served, with the Statement of Claim by KPCL's legal counsel Borden Ladner Gervais LLP.</P>
<P>72. The factual events in the Statement of Claim in this action are also at issue in the KPCL Claim and all or most of the witnesses, records and evidence necessary to CP's action will also be necessary to the KPCL Claim.</P>
<P>73. Further, CP maintained a holdback from KPCL during the course of the Project as required by the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>. CP presently holds the amount of $ 12,011,384.96 plus GST of $600,569.25 for a total of $12,611,954.21 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Holdback</BOLD>&rdquo;). The KPCL Holdback became due and owing on February 5, 2018. However, CP has failed to pay the KPCL Holdback despite demand. KPCL intends to commence proceedings in Saskatchewan or amend its existing KPCL Claim to seek recovery of the KPCL Holdback pursuant to the KPCL Contract and the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>.</P>
<P>74. I understand that CP may be asserting a set-off against KPCL based on CP's claims in this action. KPCL's claim to the KPCL Holdback is directly related to the same facts and circumstances that are in issue in the CP Statement of Claim and the KPCL Claim.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Appropriate Forum</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Subject Matter of the Dispute</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>75. As I noted earlier, the dispute as described in this action relates to the construction of a land-based rail-spur Project in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Location of Witnesses</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>76. All of the KPCL employees or contractors who are likely to be questioned for discovery or to testify at the trial of this matter reside in Saskatchewan. The following are the individuals that KPCL has identified internally as likely being required as fact witnesses:

<P>77. In addition to these 17 KPCL witnesses, KPCL retained the services of a sub-contractor, Broda Construction (&ldquo;<BOLD>Broda</BOLD>&rdquo;), which I believe operates through Broda Group Limited Partnership, to assist with the movement of earth fill during the early stages of KPCL's work on the Project. Broda is based out of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Many potential witnesses from Broda performed work in Saskatchewan and, to the best of my knowledge, are presently located in Saskatchewan. Based on my personal dealings with respect to the Project, I expect that Gord Broda, Broda's President and Russell Clunie, Broda's Vice President, both of whom live in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and Ryan Kolb, Broda's Site Supervisor for the Project, who lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, will likely be witnesses in this matter.</P>
<P>78. Based on my dealings on this matter, and the advice of Scott Manson and Riley Panteluk, I believe that the below table provides a summary of the key witnesses that will likely be the subject of questioning for discovery or will be required to provide evidence at a trial of this matter, together with my information as to their current location:

Based on the preliminary review at this early stage of matters, as set out above, I believe the majority of the witnesses that will be required for discovery and trial are located in Saskatchewan. Out of the approximately 45 individuals KPCL has identified so far, to the best of my knowledge only 9 currently reside in Alberta.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Location of Evidence</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>79. All business records of KPCL, including physical files, computer systems and email servers, are located at its head office in Estevan, Saskatchewan and all documentary evidence held by KPCL relating to this claim is located and managed in Saskatchewan. KPCL has no business records with respect to the Project that are located in Alberta.</P>
<P>80. Based on my involvement in the Project, my knowledge of the location of the people from each party, and my knowledge of the locations of the business offices of the other parties to this litigation that were the primary offices used in relation to the Project, I believe that the business records and instrumentation used in the Project of the other parties to the action, or other corporations that may be involved as witnesses, will likely be located primarily in Saskatchewan or outside of Alberta as follows:

<P>81. Any evidence required for this trial that relates to the land upon which the work was conducted, is located in Saskatchewan. For example, all soil core samples taken relating to the Project are on site in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>82. I believe that this matter will likely involve several expert witnesses. Should KPCL or the other parties wish to retain an expert who needs to observe or conduct tests at the Project site or to assess other physical evidence they will have to travel and work in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>83. If a visit to the Project site is permitted as part of the trial process, it will be in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Impact on KPCL's Business</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>84. If the Alberta Court has or maintains jurisdiction over this action and refuses KPCL's application, and KPCL's Claim proceeds in Saskatchewan, there will be dual proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, which will essentially double the costs to KPCL, CP and possibly to other parties involved in both proceedings. If the Saskatchewan Court were to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction over this dispute because the Alberta Court exercises its jurisdiction, KPCL will have been denied its opportunity to litigate in the forum of its choice and to litigate in the jurisdiction of the Project.</P>
<P>85. If KPCL is forced to litigate this matter in Alberta, it will have serious detrimental impacts on KPCL. KPCL is a mid-sized, family-run business and every member of its executive and management is based in Saskatchewan. This claim is incredibly significant to our business and, if CP is successful and recovers the amount claimed in its Statement of Claim from KPCL, it will have a very serious effect on KPCL, including damaging KPCL's reputation which will impact its business going forward.</P>
<P>86. Accordingly, I and KPCL take this matter very seriously. I believe that CP's claim has no merit, and KPCL intends to vigorously defend KPCL and advance its claims against CP. KPCL will want to exercise its rights to have a corporate representative present at any questioning or other process in this matter.</P>
<P>87. I and the other senior management team are heavily involved in the generation of new business and managing our ongoing work. All of our current work, and all of our expected work in the next few years, is in Saskatchewan. Without myself and other senior management present to run our business, KPCL's generation of new business, and management of our ongoing operations will suffer dramatically.</P>
<P>88. I understand that in the Alberta civil court process, questioning rights in the discovery process allow any party to question every other adverse party's corporate representative, officers, employees and former officers and employees, subject to the discretion of the Court to limit the scope of discovery.</P>
<P>89. If KPCL is forced to litigate this dispute in Alberta, I believe it will take KPCL's senior management out of Saskatchewan for significant periods of time, during the discovery process and during trial. Not only will this cause significant harm to KPCL's day-to-day operations, as mentioned above, it will cause KPCL to have to incur significant travel, lodging and other office rental costs as KPCL has no residences or business offices in Alberta.</P>
<P>90. I am very concerned that the fact that KPCL's senior management team will have to live out of hotels and away from their family during critical times in this matter will put KPCL at an unfair disadvantage to CP, for no apparent reason other than CP elected to commence this action in Alberta where its head office is, instead of in the Province of Saskatchewan where the Project took place and where CP also conducts business.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Impact on CP's Business</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>91. I believe that the impact on CP's business will be minor relative to the impact on KPCL. CP is a large Canadian public railway company with many employees and operations and offices across Canada, including employee accommodations located in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. It has office space in Saskatchewan near the Project and in Regina where the KPCL Claim was filed. Given the nature of its involvement in the Project, I believe CP will likely have fewer witnesses, and certainly fewer witnesses that will have to travel from Alberta to Saskatchewan than the number of witnesses that will be forced to travel to Alberta from Saskatchewan and elsewhere if the Alberta Court has and maintains jurisdiction over this case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Time for Trial</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>92. As I noted above, KPCL takes the claims against it very seriously. I would like to have this dispute resolved as quickly as reasonably possible, particularly given the KPCL Holdback which CP may resist paying in full until this dispute is resolved.</P>
<P>93. Given the scope of the Project, and the number of lay witnesses and records involved, and the fact that I believe that several expert witnesses will likely be required in this matter, I believe the trial of this matter will take at least several weeks.</P>
<P>94. I am advised by Lorie Gale, practice assistant at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, and believe that she has contacted Ashley, the trial coordinator at the Calgary Courthouse of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, and has been advised that trials in Calgary, once they are ready or ordered to be set down for trial, are currently being booked into 2021 for anything over a 10 day trial.</P>
<P>95. I am advised by Lorie Gale and believe that she has contacted Wendy, the trial coordinator at the Regina courthouse of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench, and has been advised that trials in Regina, once they are ready or ordered to be set down for trial, are currently being booked into 2019 (depending on when a pre-trial conference is scheduled).</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>96. I make this Affidavit in support of the KPCL's application filed together with this my Affidavit.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;) seeks to set aside the Statement of Claim of Canadian Pacific Railway (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in this action (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Action</BOLD>&rdquo;) for want of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, seeks a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Application</BOLD>&rdquo;). Three of the other Defendants in this Action, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;) have filed similar applications challenging this Court's jurisdiction and asserting that Alberta is not the appropriate forum for this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Application by KPCL filed February 8, 2018; Application by Clifton filed February 23, 2018; Application by Intact filed March 26, 2018; Application by Hatch filed March 29, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL supports those applications.</P>
<P>2. The core of this matter relates to a construction project located in Saskatchewan for the construction of a new, 30.4 km railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Project</BOLD>&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Panteluk Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which was designed for construction in Saskatchewan, was constructed in Saskatchewan by a Saskatchewan company, and suffered a foundation failure in Saskatchewan; a failure that was investigated, redesigned, and repaired in Saskatchewan. It involves seven parties, all of whom carry on business in Saskatchewan, alleged torts committed in Saskatchewan, contracts made in Saskatchewan or outside Alberta, and involves conduct predominantly carried out in or related to Saskatchewan and subject to the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>. KPCL has no presence in Alberta, and the connections to Alberta of the other parties, and the core of the dispute, are minimal.</P>
<P>3. The main connection to Alberta is the presence of the Plaintiff, CP, which appears to have engaged in forum shopping without concern for the forum with the real and substantial connection to the dispute, or the most efficient and appropriate forum. If CP's choice is endorsed by this Honourable Court because it determines both that it has jurisdiction and that it will exercise it, it will create inefficiencies, negatively impact many witnesses, delay the resolution of the dispute, increase costs, prejudice the defendants, and create a multiplicity of proceedings. All of these concerns can be addressed, and a fairer and more efficient process can be achieved, if the dispute is dealt within the clearly more appropriate jurisdiction of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>4. In this Action, CP is seeking added project costs it suffered as a result of various alleged breaches of contract, negligence or misrepresentations relating to the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Defendants KPCL, Hatch, Clifton, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) are contractors or subcontractors retained with respect to the Project. Intact is an insurance company that provided a Performance Bond and a Labour and Material Payment Bond (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Bonds</BOLD>&rdquo;) with respect to the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Percy Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. There are other proceedings relating to the Project that are currently underway in Saskatchewan. On August 28, 2017, KPCL filed a Statement of Claim against CP in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Regina Judicial Centre, file no. QBG2177/17; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;29&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and on March 5, 2018 filed a separate Originating Application in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench relating to CP's refusal to pay out a holdback to KPCL relating to the Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Holdback Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Regina Judicial Centre, file no. QBG655; Notice to Admit Facts from KPCL to CP dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Notice to Admit to CP</BOLD>&rdquo;), Schedule &ldquo;E&rdquo;. The Saskatchewan Action and the KPCL Holdback Application are referred to collectively as the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Proceedings</BOLD>&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>Saskatchewan Action</TI>
<P>31. On August 28, 2017, the Saskatchewan Action was filed.

<P>33. On February 28, 2018, CP filed an application and supporting affidavit in the Saskatchewan Action (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CP Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; Ex parte application of CP filed February 28, 2018 and Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; Application by CP filed February 28, 2018; Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule <EM>&ldquo;C&rdquo;</EM> Affidavit of Justin Meyer.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The CP Application sought: an order varying the time for CP to file a Statement of Defence in the Saskatchewan Action; an order staying the need to file a Statement of Defence in the Saskatchewan Action pending the determination of the KPCL Application in Alberta; and a declaration that CP had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Saskatchewan as a result of the CP Application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; Application by CP filed February 28, 2018, para 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34.

<P1>(d) in the further alternative, an Order directing that CP's participation in the KPCL Holdback Application does not amount to attornment with respect to the Saskatchewan Action and establishing certain procedural timelines.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;I&rdquo;, Application of CP dated March 13, 2018, paras 1-5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>35.

<P>36. The CP Application, the Second CP Application and the KPCL Holdback Application were heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench, on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this Brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. ISSUES</TI>
<P>37. The determination of the KPCL Application requires the Court to address the following issues:
<P1>1. Does the Alberta Court have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over KPCL or the claims made against KPCL?</P1>
<P1>2. If the answer to 1. is yes, is Alberta <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>?</P1></P>
<P>38. For the reasons that follow, KPCL submits that this Court does not have jurisdiction over KPCL or the claims made against KPCL in the Action and, even if this Court does have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM>, which is denied, it should decline to exercise its jurisdiction and should stay the Action and defer to the clearly more appropriate forum of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>39. The two main issues in this case are distinct. The jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> analysis is meant to ensure that a court <EM>has</EM> jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Haaretz</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis comes into play when jurisdiction is established and has no relevance to the jurisdictional analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Van Breda v Club Resorts Ltd</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>101</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Van Breda</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is meant to guide the courts in determining whether they should decline to exercise jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 26 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Alberta Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM></TI>
<P>40. The jurisdiction of a Court has territorial limits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Greenbuilt Group of Companies Ltd v RMD Engineering Inc</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 297</CITE><PARANUM>29&ndash;33</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Greenbuilt</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the common law recognized two bases for a Court's jurisdiction over a foreign defendant: (1) if the foreign defendant was present in the territory of the Court's jurisdiction (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;presence-based jurisdiction&rdquo;) or, (2) if the foreign defendant consented to the Court's jurisdiction (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;consent-based jurisdiction&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at paras 30 - 31 [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>]; Peter W Hogg, <EM>Constitutional Law of Canada</EM>, 5<SUP>th</SUP> ed (Toronto: Thomas Reuters, 2007) at 13-17-13.24.4 [<BOLD>Tab 4</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Phillips v Avena</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 19</CITE><PARANUM>76</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Phillips</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 5</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Chevron Corp v Yaiguaje</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>82</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Chevron</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt v Courcelles</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>60 OR (3d) 20</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Muscutt</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By statute, all Canadian Provinces have added a third basis of jurisdiction, namely &ldquo;assumed jurisdiction&rdquo; which is based on the service of process on a foreign defendant outside of the territory of the Court.</P>
<P>41. In this case, CP has failed to establish that this Court has jurisdiction over KPCL under any of the three jurisdictional bases.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Presence-Based Jurisdiction</TI>
<P>42. Presence-based jurisdiction is based on the requirement and sufficiency of personal service of the originating process within the province or territory of the forum (service <EM>in juris</EM>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 83 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> To establish traditional, presence-based jurisdiction over an out-of-province corporate defendant, it must also be shown that the defendant was carrying on business in the forum at the time of the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at paras 85 and 89 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, in this case, presence-based jurisdiction over KPCL would require both service <EM>in juris</EM> and that KPCL was carrying on business in Alberta at the time of the Action. Neither of these requirements are present here.</P>
<P>43. Although KPCL was extra-provincially registered in Alberta at the time it was served in Saskatchewan, KPCL was not served <EM>in juris.</EM> KPCL was served <EM>ex juris</EM>, at its office in Estevan, Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit Facts to KPCL, Schedule &ldquo;C&rdquo; Affidavit of Justin Meyer sworn February 28, 2018, at para 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In any event, as will be discussed later in this Brief,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Part IV(A)(b) below.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> while it was extra-provincially registered in Alberta at the time of the Action, KPCL was not carrying on business in Alberta at the time of the Action. There can be no presence-based jurisdiction over KPCL.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(ii)</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Consent-Based Jurisdiction</TI>
<P>44. The KPCL Contract does not contain a choice of jurisdiction clause. Further, when served with the Statement of Claim by CP, KPCL took steps to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court to hear this Action by filing the KPCL Application. KPCL has not filed a Statement of Defence and has not taken any actions to defend itself on the merits in this Action or to otherwise engage the jurisdiction of this Court, and has therefore not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iii)</N><TI>No Jurisdiction over KPCL based on Assumed Jurisdiction</TI>
<BLOCK5><N>a.</N><TI>General Principles</TI>
<P>45. The third basis for jurisdiction is assumed jurisdiction, which developed through the adoption of rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chevron</EM> at para 83 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Before a court can assume jurisdiction over a claim, a &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo; connection must be shown between the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the jurisdiction where the claim is brought.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lapointe Rosenstein Marchand Melancon LLP v Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 30</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Lapointe</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The real and substantial connection test has evolved into an important constitutional test or principle that imposes limits on the reach of a province's laws and courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If met, it establishes a territorial basis for, and therefore, a territorial limit to, a court's jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. In order to properly respect the court's territorial limits, it is necessary to distinguish between the procedural rules set out in the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM> for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, and the substantive rules relating to the assumption of jurisdiction. The procedural rules &ldquo;are nothing more than a means of giving notice of a proceeding to a person who might be interested in knowing about it&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 67 [<BOLD>Tab 3]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is a different concept from assumption of, or establishing, jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 69 [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, while the <EM>Rules</EM> must be followed in order for service <EM>ex juris</EM> to be valid, the provincial rules are purely procedural and do not by themselves establish jurisdiction in any case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 43 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Chevron</EM> at para 70 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>]; <EM>Muscutt</EM> at para 49-50 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Ayles v Arsenault</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 493</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Ayles</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada v Wainoco Oil &amp; Gas Company</SOC><CITE>2004 ABQB 643</CITE><PARANUM>36</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Royal QB</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Best v Palacios</SOC><CITE>2016 NBCA 59</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Best</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, a plaintiff wishing to claim against an out-of-province defendant, must meet both the procedural service <EM>ex juris</EM> requirements and the substantive real and substantial connection test.</P>
<P>47. In Alberta, <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(1) of the <EM>Rules</EM> provides that a commencement document can only be served outside of Alberta and in Canada if &ldquo;a real and substantial connection exists between Alberta and the facts on which a claim in an action is based<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, Alta Reg 124/2010 r 11.25 [<BOLD>Tab 27</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. The authority for the legislated extension of the jurisdiction of the Courts by the Provinces is found in section 92(14) of the <EM>Constitution Act, 1867</EM> which is the power over &ldquo;the administration of justice <EM>in the province</EM>&rdquo; [emphasis added].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Constitution Act, 1867</EM> (UK), 30 &amp; 31 Vict, c 3, reprinted in RSC 1985, Appendix II, No 5 [<BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Legislative enactments that extend jurisdiction are, therefore, subject to the &ldquo;in the province&rdquo; requirement of section 92(14).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Equustek Solutions Inc v Google Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 BCCA 265</CITE><PARANUM>48 and 49</PARANUM></CASEREF> (leave granted to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada) [<BOLD>Tab 13</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>Van Breda</EM> confirmed that a province's service <EM>ex juris</EM> legislation is only &ldquo;in the province&rdquo; and, therefore, a legitimate exercise of the power of the Legislature of a Province, if it is limited to matters that have a real and substantial connection to the Province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 21 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the real and substantial connection test and its analytical framework, which involves two stages of analysis:
<P1>(a) the plaintiff has the onus and burden to establish the existence of one or more objective, presumptive factors connecting the action or the defendant to the plaintiff's chosen jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Gulevich v Miller</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 411</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Gulevich</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiff must establish that one or more of the identified listed presumptive factors exists,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or that the Court should identify a new factor which also presumptively entitles the Court to take jurisdiction;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 91 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(b) if the plaintiff proves a presumptive connecting factor, it remains open to the defendant to rebut the presumption of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> by demonstrating that in the circumstances of the particular case, the presumptive connecting factor does not point to any real relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum, or points only to a weak connection.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 95 [<BOLD>Tab 2]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>49. If the Court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction because none of the presumptive connecting factors exist or because the presumption of jurisdiction that flows from one of those factors has been rebutted, it must dismiss or stay the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 100 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, CP has failed to establish that any presumptive connecting factors exist as against KPCL&mdash;and the Action should be dismissed or stayed.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>b.</N><TI>None of the Identified Presumptive Connecting Factors Apply to KPCL</TI>
<P>50. CP's claims against KPCL, and the other Defendants in the Action, are based in tort and contract.</P>
<P>51. The list of identified presumptive connecting factors grounding a court's assumption of jurisdiction over tort claims has, subject to the possible identification of new presumptive factors, been settled by the Supreme Court of Canada. They are: (a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province; (b) the defendant carries on business in the province; (c) the tort was committed in the province; and (d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 90 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 36 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. The presumptive connecting factors in breach of contract cases has not had significant judicial consideration since <EM>Van Breda</EM>. In Alberta, it has been suggested that, in addition to the defendant being resident or carrying on business in the jurisdiction, presumptive connecting factors in a breach of contract case are (a) a contract or alleged contract is made, performed or breached in Alberta; and (b) a tort connected with the contract was committed in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bansal v Ferrera Pan Candy Co</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 384</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 15</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Osman v Markplan Inc</SOC><CITE>2018 ABCA 215</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 74</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. As set out below, none of these identified presumptive connecting factors apply to the claim against KPCL in this case.</P>
<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>KPCL is Not Domiciled or Resident in Alberta</UNDER></TI>

<P>56.

<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>KPCL's Alleged Torts Were Not Committed in Alberta</UNDER></TI>
<P>57. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that in determining where a tort is committed it is unnecessary and unwise to have resort to a set of arbitrary rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Moran v Pyle National (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1975] 1 SCR 393</CITE><PAGENUM>at 408</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Moran</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court noted that the use of the place of the damage sustained as a connecting factor may raise difficult issues and did not constitute a presumptive connecting factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 89 and 119 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This led to some uncertainty as to whether the Supreme Court of Canada intended to adopt a bright-line test for the <EM>situs</EM> of a tort based on where the alleged tortious conduct occurred.</P>
<P>58. The Alberta Court of Appeal has subsequently acknowledged that the Supreme Court of Canada, in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, was concerned that &ldquo;giving jurisdiction to a place where a plaintiff suffers pain and inconvenience creates uncertainty and opens the door to forums taking jurisdiction over tort actions that have little connection to the matter beyond the location of the plaintiff.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 42 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the Court of Appeal confirmed that <EM>Van Breda</EM> did not intend to create a bright-line test based only on the place where the conduct occurred.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 35 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to the Court of Appeal, the place where the tort is committed is the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by the respondent's activities or its consequences&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 46 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. In this case, the Statement of Claim alleges KPCL breached a duty of care in its execution of work on the Project in Saskatchewan pursuant to the KPCL Contract and was negligent in the performance of its work.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 89-108.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's damages claimed against KPCL relate to the allegation that KPCL's negligence contributed to the Foundation Failure,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 110.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which occurred in Saskatchewan, and the failure to obtain course of construction insurance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> All of KPCL's activity in the performance of the KPCL Contract, including all construction efforts and the obtaining of insurance, occurred in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 33, 34, and 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The damages CP claims all relate to the costs of investigating the Foundation Failure, and the costs to redesign and reconstruct the Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. In this case, any debate about whether the tort is committed in the place of KPCL's conduct, where the injury occurred, or where damage was sustained, is moot. Under any articulation of the test, KPCL's alleged torts occurred in Saskatchewan and it is beyond doubt that the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by [KPCL]'s activities or its consequences&rdquo; is Saskatchewan. Even CP recognized this, and did not rely on Rule 11.25(3)(d) in its Statement of Claim as a ground for service <EM>ex juris</EM> in the Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>KPCL's Alleged Torts Are not Connected to a Contract Made in Alberta</UNDER></TI>
<P>61. The presumptive connecting factor of a &ldquo;contract connected with the dispute was made in the province&rdquo; involves two requirements. First, there must be a contract that is made in the jurisdiction, as determined by the traditional rules of contract formation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 39 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A contract is formed based on an offer by one party, accepted by the other, or by an exchange of promises, supported by consideration. Where the contracting parties are located in different jurisdictions, the contract will be formed in the jurisdiction where the last essential act of contract formation, such as communication of acceptance, took place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 40 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Levasseur v Autorit&ea; des March&ea;s Financiers</SOC><CITE>2012 NBQB 409</CITE><PARANUM>43</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 19</BOLD>]; <EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 108 [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. If there is a contract made in the jurisdiction, it must also be connected to the dispute. This requires that &ldquo;a defendant's conduct brings him or her within the scope of the contractual relationship and that the events that give rise to the claim flow from the relationship created by the contract.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 44 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 116-117 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Export Packers Company Limited v SPI International Transportation</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 481</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 20</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Put another way, if it can be established that &ldquo;but-for&rdquo; a chain of related contracts, the alleged tort would not have occurred, then the contract may be connected to the dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Toews v First Choice Canada Inc (Signature Vacations and Sellofvacations.com)</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 784</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Toews</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 21</BOLD>], affirmed <CASEREF><CITE>2016 ABQB 130</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 22</BOLD>], and further affirmed <CASEREF><CITE>2016 ABCA 408</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 23</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. CP asserts that &ldquo;the claim relates to contracts made in Alberta&rdquo;, but does not identify which contracts it refers to in the grounds for asserting jurisdiction in the Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The contracts identified in the Statement of Claim are addressed below.</P>
<P>64. <UNDER>The KPCL Contract was Not Made in Alberta</UNDER>. KPCL negotiated the terms of the KPCL Contract out of its Saskatchewan office with CP through CP's Mississauga office. Based on the evidence, the KPCL contract was clearly not made in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 20&ndash;28, and Exhibits &ldquo;5&rdquo;, &ldquo;6&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. <UNDER>The Intact Contract was Not Made in Alberta</UNDER>. Intact issued the Bonds in relation to the Project, at KPCL's request. These were approved in Ontario, and executed by Intact's attorney-in-fact and issued in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The issued Bonds were provided by Intact's agent to KPCL in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> None of these contracts were made in Alberta.</P>
<P>66. <UNDER>The Hatch Contract was Not Made in Alberta.</UNDER> To the extent the evidence of where the agreement or agreements between Hatch and CP were made is unclear, then CP has failed to discharge its onus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 80 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 18 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, KPCL submits that it can be inferred from the evidence before the Court that any agreements between Hatch and CP were made outside of Alberta:
<P1>(a) there is no evidence as to where the 2012 Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch was made;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) all discussions with CP related to Hatch's proposal to perform work on the Project were with CP's Ontario office;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) CP's acceptance of Hatch's proposal was sent by CP from its Ontario office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 14, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Although the letter in evidence is not signed by Hatch, it can be inferred that it was executed by Hatch and the communication of the acceptance was sent by Hatch to CP's Ontario office;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(d) there is no evidence as to where the Amending Agreements to the Supply of Services Agreement, were made.</P1></P>
<P>67. <UNDER>The Clifton Contract was Not Made in Alberta.</UNDER> The April 8, 2015 Supply of Services of Agreement between Clifton and CP referenced in the Statement of Claim was not made in Alberta. On April 8, 2015, CP, through its Ontario office communicated to Clifton that CP had selected Clifton to carry out geotechnical work on the Project<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and Clifton signed that letter in Saskatchewan and returned it to CP's Ontario office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The final Clifton Contract was executed by Clifton on April 16, 2015 and, on its face, was accepted by CP on April 30, 2015<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;. It appears that there is a typo in paragraph 15 of the Clifton Affidavit where it states that CP executed the Clifton Contract on April 15, 2015.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and then presumably returned and communicated to Clifton in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>68. <UNDER>The Thurber and Altus Contracts were Not Made in Alberta</UNDER>. There is no evidence that either of the January 1, 2012 Master Services Agreement between CP and Thurber,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or the &ldquo;Altus Agreement&rdquo; as defined in the Statement of Claim,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 115.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> were made in Alberta.</P>
<P>69. As CP has not discharged its onus to establish any relevant contracts that were made in Alberta, those agreements cannot be used to found jurisdiction and it is unnecessary in this application for the Court to assess whether KPCL's conduct brought KPCL within the scope of the contractual relationships between CP and the other Defendants.</P></BLOCK6>
<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>KPCL's Contract was Not Performed or Breached in Alberta</UNDER></TI>
<P>70.

<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>No Tort Connected to the KPCL Contract was Committed in Alberta.</UNDER></TI>

<P>72. As noted earlier, KPCL's alleged negligence was not committed in Alberta&mdash;if it was committed at all, it was committed in Saskatchewan. The same analysis applies to the alleged claims of negligence against the other Defendants.

<P>74. The list of presumptive connecting factors is not closed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 91 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, courts cannot simply identify a new factor on a whim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Best</EM> at para 23 [<BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Over time, courts may identify new factors which also presumptively entitle a court to assume jurisdiction. In identifying new presumptive factors, a court should look to connections that give rise to a relationship with the forum that is similar in nature to the ones which result from the listed factors. Relevant factors include: (a) similarity of the connecting factor with the recognized presumptive connecting factors; (b) treatment of the connecting factor in the case law; (c) treatment of the connecting factor in the statute law; and (d) treatment of the connecting factor in the private international law of other legal systems with a shared commitment to order, fairness and comity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 91 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The onus will be on CP if it intends to rely on a new presumptive factor.</P>
<P>75. In this case, in the Statement of Claim, other than asserting consent-based jurisdiction over Hatch and Clifton, which is not relevant to KPCL, CP relies on two additional grounds to establish jurisdiction which are not in the identified presumptive connecting factors: (a) the claim relates to contracts governed by Alberta law; and (b) the Defendants who reside outside of Alberta are necessary and proper parties to the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK6><TI><UNDER>Governing Law of the KPCL Contract is Not a Presumptive Connecting Factor</UNDER></TI>
<P>76. <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(c) provides that, for the purposes of service ex <EM>juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection exists where the claim is governed by Alberta law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 11.25(3)(c) [<BOLD>Tab 27</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, as noted earlier, this is procedural only and does not, by itself, provide the Court the substantive basis to assert jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 43 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Chevron</EM> at para 70 [<BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>]; <EM>Muscutt</EM> at paras 49-50 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>]; <EM>AyIes</EM> at para 16 [<BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>]; <EM>Royal QB</EM> at para 36 [<BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>]; <EM>Best</EM> at para 25 [<BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>77. In any event, whether the governing law should be recognized as a presumptive connecting factor is moot as it relates to the assertion of jurisdiction over KPCL, because KPCL's contract, on a proper analysis, is governed by the law of Saskatchewan. To determine the governing law over a contract where the parties have not made a choice of law, the Court must examine all relevant facts to determine the proper law of contract and must ascertain which &ldquo;system of law has the closest and most real connection&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Greenbuilt</EM> at para 111 [<BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The place of performance is an important criterion to be considered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lilydale Cooperative Ltd v Meyn Canada Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 281</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 26</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada v Wainoco Oil &amp; Gas Company</SOC><CITE>2005 ABCA 198</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Royal CA</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 54</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>80. In this case, CP has failed to establish that any Defendant was served in Alberta. This is enough to dismiss this ground. However, even if CP can establish that a Defendant was served in Alberta, KPCL submits that this is not enough to establish substantive jurisdiction.</P>
<P>81. <EM>Van Breda</EM> supports the conclusion that there is no constitutional basis for the extension of jurisdiction over foreign defendants under <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(i) of the Alberta <EM>Rules</EM> (where a foreign defendant &ldquo;is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta&rdquo;).

It was further noted in <EM>Van Breda CA</EM> that this factor has not gained general acceptance as a presumptive factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 55, 78 and 79 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda CA</EM> at paras 74&ndash;84 [<BOLD>Tab 73</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The rejection of this factor as a presumptive connecting factor has been accepted by other courts<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Best</EM> at para 25 [<BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Misyura v Walton</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 5397</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 30</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and is consistent with other pre-<EM>Van Breda</EM> cases where the core of the claim was not connected to the domestic jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Muscutt</EM> [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Deuruneft Deutsche-Russishce Mineralol Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Bullen</SOC><CITE>2003 ABQB 743</CITE><PARANUM>87</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 31</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Lemmex v Bernard</SOC><CITE>[2002] OJ No 2131</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 32</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Gajraj v DeBernardo</SOC><CITE>[2002] OJ No 2130</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 33</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Paraie v Cangemi</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 6341</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 34</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>83. Notwithstanding <EM>Van Breda</EM>, in Alberta there is a line of subsequent cases that have made comments, in <EM>obiter</EM>, that the necessary and proper party factor was sufficient to found substantive jurisdiction or was a presumptive connecting factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Turner</EM> at para 59 [<BOLD>Tab 29</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Geophysical Service Inc</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 35</BOLD>]; <EM>Toews</EM> at para 66 [<BOLD>Tab 21</BOLD>]. On appeal of <EM>Toews</EM>, [<BOLD>Tab 22</BOLD>] the Court of Queen's Bench found that it did not need to consider the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability or constitutionality of Rule 11.25(3)(i) because it had already established jurisdiction under one of the presumptive connecting factors listed in <EM>Van Breda</EM>. The Court of Appeal also did not address this issue: <EM>Toews</EM> [<BOLD>Tab 23</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In each of these cases, the Court had established jurisdiction based on recognized presumptive connecting factors,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Turner</EM>, the Court had already found that the contracts in issue had been performed or breached in Alberta: at para 27 [<BOLD>Tab 29</BOLD>]; in <EM>Toews</EM>, the Court had already found that there were contracts made in Alberta that were connected with the alleged tort in dispute: at para 57 [<BOLD>Tab 21</BOLD>]; in <EM>Geophysical Service Inc</EM>, the Court also held that the alleged tort of conversion was committed in Alberta [<BOLD>Tab 35</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and so the <EM>obiter</EM> comments about the &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; factor are not binding on this Court. With respect, to the extent they are not consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, which is binding on this Court, they cannot be and should not be followed.</P>
<P>84. <EM>Rule</EM> 11.25(3)(i), if applied broadly, reaches beyond the legislative competence of the Province to extend the territorial limits of the Court's jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>This conclusion is unaffected by whether the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM> are substantive or procedural.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Rule conflates jurisdiction of the Court over a defendant that is obtained by way of presence-based jurisdiction, with the assumption of jurisdiction of the Court based on a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of the dispute and the forum. The fact that the Court may have jurisdiction over one defendant by service in the forum has little to do with whether there is a real and substantial connection between the forum and an action against a foreign defendant. In this case, there is no real and substantial connection to Alberta.</P></BLOCK6></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>d.</N><TI>Any Presumptive Connecting Factors are Rebutted</TI>
<P>85. As noted earlier, the presumption of jurisdiction that arises where a recognized connecting factor&mdash;whether listed or new&mdash;applies is not irrebuttable. The burden of rebutting the presumption on the basis that a given connection is inappropriate in the circumstances of the case rests on the party challenging the assumption of jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 81 and 95 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The ability to rebut the presumption of jurisdiction where there is only a weak relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum serves as an important check on jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 95 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 40 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The presumption may be rebutted where the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the litigation is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 43 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at paras 81 and 97 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. At its core, this case is about claims by CP for breach of contract and negligence related to the design and construction of a rail spur on land in Saskatchewan. The vast majority of the alleged wrongdoing, if not all of it, took place in Saskatchewan. The injury was suffered in Saskatchewan, and the alleged damages all relate to investigations, redesign, and reconstruction or remediation efforts related to the Project in Saskatchewan. If CP can somehow establish a presumptive connection, it will not override the fact that there is, at best, only a very weak connection between the core subject matter of the Action and Alberta.</P>
<P>87. In these circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect that KPCL would be called to answer proceedings in Alberta and any presumptive connecting factors are rebutted.</P>
<P>88. In summary, CP has failed to discharge its onus to establish that this Honourable Court has jurisdiction over KCPL or the Action. The Court need not go any further and the Action should be stayed or dismissed.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Alberta Is <EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></TI>
<P>89. Even if this Court has jurisdiction with respect to the Action, it is clear that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Saskatchewan is clearly a more appropriate forum to hear this dispute.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>General Principles</TI>
<P>90. Finding that there is a real and substantial connection does not automatically mean that a court will or should assume jurisdiction over a claim. Once jurisdiction is established, the party contesting jurisdiction may raise the doctrine of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and attempt to &ldquo;show why the court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction and displace the forum chosen by the plaintiff&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 51 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 103 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>91. The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that a court of another jurisdiction has a real and substantial connection to the claim and that the alternative forum is clearly more appropriate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 52 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109; <CASEREF><SOC>Breeden v Black</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 36</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While the normal state of affairs favours exercising jurisdiction in the forum where it is properly assumed, this should never come at the cost of one party facing unfair or clearly inefficient proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Courts must be mindful that jurisdiction may sometimes be established on a rather low threshold.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The purpose of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is to temper any potential rigidity in the rules governing the assumption of jurisdiction and to &ldquo;assure fairness to the parties and the efficient resolution of the dispute&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>]; <EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 104 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Where the evidence indicates that the alternative forum is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation, a court should grant the stay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>92. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is fact specific and discretionary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Muscutt</EM> at para 42 [<BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A party applying for a stay may raise diverse facts, considerations and concerns, as the doctrine focuses on the contexts of individual cases.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 105 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court set out a list of non-exhaustive factors to consider in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis: the location of the parties and the witnesses; the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or declining the stay; the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings; the possibility of conflicting judgments; problems related to recognition and enforcement of judgments; and the relative strength of the connection of the parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Other relevant factors may include where the cause of action arose, where the loss or damage occurred, any juridical advantages, the cost of conducting the litigation, applicable substantive law, and the difficulty in proving foreign law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bidell Equipment LP v Caliber Midstream GP LLC</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 76</CITE><PARANUM>25 and 27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 37</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Dirtt Environmental Solutions Ltd v Almond</SOC><CITE>2010 ABQB 499</CITE><PARANUM>45</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 38</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(ii)</N><TI>Saskatchewan has a Real and Substantial Connection to the Action</TI>
<P>93. As noted above, the defendant seeking a stay based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> must establish that the alternative forum has a real and substantial connection to the claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 109 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, there is no doubt that there is a real and substantial connection with this claim and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In Saskatchewan <EM>The Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997, c C-41.1 provides that Saskatchewan has territorial competence over a proceeding if, among other things, &ldquo;there is a real and substantial connection between Saskatchewan and the facts on which the proceeding against that person is based&rdquo; (s 9). [<BOLD>Tab 39</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition to presence-based jurisdiction over KPCL and Clifton as Saskatchewan corporations, and all other parties because they carry on business in Saskatchewan and can be served there,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo; (KPCL); Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo; (CP); Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo; (Intact); Exhibit &ldquo;19&rdquo; (Clifton); Exhibit &ldquo;22&rdquo; (Hatch); Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo; (Thurber); Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo; (Altus).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and consent-based jurisdiction over KPCL, Hatch, Intact and Clifton (who all apply to have this Action stayed in favour of Saskatchewan), there are presumptive connecting factors in Saskatchewan. As noted, all parties carry on business in Saskatchewan, and the very core of the dispute relates to alleged torts committed in Saskatchewan and contracts made, performed or allegedly breached in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iii)</N><TI>Saskatchewan is Clearly the More Appropriate Forum</TI>
<P>94. A review of relevant factors establishes that Saskatchewan is clearly the more appropriate forum, which will lead to the more fair and efficient resolution of the dispute.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Location of Parties and Where they Carry on Business</UNDER></TI>
<P>95. There are seven parties to the Action. None of them are Alberta corporations. Altus is an Alberta registered limited partnership with its head office in Edmonton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP is a federal corporation with its head office in Alberta. The rest of the parties are federal corporations (Intact, Clifton),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 2; Clifton Affidavit, para 2, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a Saskatchewan corporation (KPCL), a British Columbia corporation (Thurber) and an Ontario corporation (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo;; Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;21&rdquo;; Paneltuk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;24&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These corporations have their head offices outside of Alberta, namely in Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 9; Clifton Affidavit, para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> in British Columbia (Thurber)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>96. Not all of the parties to this Action have a business presence in Alberta. Notably, KPCL has no business presence or office in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On the other hand, all parties are registered in Saskatchewan,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;1&rdquo; (KPCL); Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo; (CP); Exhibit &ldquo;10&rdquo; (Intact); Exhibit &ldquo;19&rdquo; (Clifton); Exhibit &ldquo;22&rdquo; (Hatch); Exhibit &ldquo;26&rdquo; (Thurber); Exhibit &ldquo;28&rdquo; (Altus).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carry on business in Saskatchewan, and the work related to the claims made in the Action was conducted in, or prepared for the Project in, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>97. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Location of the Witnesses</UNDER></TI>
<P>98. The location of witnesses who are likely to be the subject of document discovery, oral discovery, or who may testify at trial, overwhelmingly supports Saskatchewan as the most appropriate forum. Logistically, conducting the action in Alberta will be inefficient and cause significant travel and disruption to a much larger number of witnesses than having CP's claim dealt with in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>99. The following table summarizes the evidence about the location of potential witnesses:

<P>100. This evidence confirms that only 17 (24%) of the identified potential witnesses are resident in Alberta, and 40 (56%) are resident in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>101. If the Action proceeds in Alberta, the current evidence is that approximately 54 witnesses (76% of the identified witnesses) will have to travel to Alberta from Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Manitoba or Ontario. Clifton and KPCL are the most affected, with 26 witnesses that will have to travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta, including both of their senior management and employees. Their evidence of the significant harm this will cause them is unchallenged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 91; Clifton Affidavit, para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The significant impact on witnesses has been recognized as an important factor in numerous <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> cases.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 53 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>] the Supreme Court of Canada did not disturb the trial judge's finding that the inconvenience and expense to Israeli defendants to attend the trial in Ontario was a relevant factor. For example, see also: <CASEREF><SOC>Shinoff v BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 926</CITE><PARANUM>17&ndash;20</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 40</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Multiactive Software Inc v Advanced Service Solutions Inc</SOC><CITE>2003 BCSC 643</CITE><PARANUM>15 and 29</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Multiactive</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 41</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Sullivan v Four Seasons Hotels Limited</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 4622</CITE><PARANUM>55</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 42</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Churchill Cellars Ltd v Haider</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 2013</CITE><PARANUM>35&ndash;37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 43</BOLD>]; <EM>Royal QB</EM> at para 64 [<BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>102. If the Action proceeds in Saskatchewan, only 31 (44% of the identified witnesses) will have to travel from outside of Saskatchewan. Hatch has confirmed that it would be a relatively minor inconvenience for its witnesses to travel to Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP carries on business across Canada<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and has offices in Saskatchewan and has not filed any evidence to suggest that it would be an undue inconvenience to CP for its witnesses to travel to Saskatchewan. In fact, CP has not filed any evidence regarding witnesses expected to be called at trial or their locations. This is a relevant factor to the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis and leaves the overwhelming evidence above uncontroverted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 70 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>103. The Alberta Court will have no jurisdiction over 54 (70% of the potential witnesses). If any witnesses are not cooperative, there is a greater chance that the Alberta Court will have to resort to more expensive and inefficient procedures to compel the testimony of out-of-province witnesses, through letters rogatory and the seeking of judicial assistance from the Saskatchewan and other courts. This risk is less in Saskatchewan where only 44% of the potential witnesses are out of the Province.</P>
<P>104. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Location of Physical Evidence</UNDER></TI>
<P>105. The location of electronic records will not likely be an impediment to the claims made in the Action proceeding in Alberta or Saskatchewan. However, the evidence is that the real, physical evidence is primarily located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>106. All business records of KPCL, including physical files are located in Estevan, Saskatchewan and all documentary evidence held by KPCL relating to the claim is located and managed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has no business records with respect to the Project that are located in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> All of Clifton's records with respect to the Project are located in Regina.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The uncontroverted evidence is that many of the physical records of the other parties will be located in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>107. Further, the claim relates to lands which are located in Saskatchewan, and a foundation failure on those lands. Evidence relating to the lands will be located entirely in Saskatchewan (for example, soil core samples).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, if access or preservation of the real property evidence is required for the purposes of expert evidence, tests, observations or site visits as part of a trial, this will largely need to take place in Saskatchewan at the site of the Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, paras 81 and 82; Clifton Affidavit, para 25; Paton Affidavit, para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Alberta Court will not have jurisdiction to make <EM>in rem</EM> orders related to that evidence or property, and may need to go through the extra step of seeking the judicial assistance of the Saskatchewan courts. On the other hand, a Saskatchewan court will have territorial jurisdiction over the lands at issue and will be in a position to make orders providing access to, preservation of, or inspection of the Project lands.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, Sask Gaz December 27, 2013, 2684, [<EM>The Court of Queen's Bench Rules</EM>], r 6-42 [<BOLD>Tab 44</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>108. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Timely Resolution of the Dispute</UNDER></TI>
<P>109. Judicial resources should be allocated and expended with a view to making the litigation quicker, more economical and less complicated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 58 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In Alberta, a foundational rule, <EM>Rule</EM> 1.2(1), provides that the purpose of the rules is to &ldquo;provide a means by which claims can be fairly and justly resolved in or by a court process in a timely and cost-effective way&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 1.2(1) [<BOLD>Tab 45</BOLD>],</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The rules are intended to be used to, among other things, &ldquo;facilitate the quickest means of resolving a claim at the least expense&rdquo; and to &ldquo;provide an effective, efficient, and credible system of remedies&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>, r 1.2(2) <BOLD>Tab 45</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Saskatchewan rules have similar provisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, r 1-3 [<BOLD>Tab 46</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL submits that, consistent with these principles, the courts in Alberta and Saskatchewan should work cooperatively and consistently to promote the efficient resolution of the disputes related to the Project.</P>
<P>110. As a general principle, all parties prefer a timely and efficient resolution of disputes. In this case, however, KPCL and Intact have specifically provided evidence of the need to have timely resolution of CP's claim due to the impact of the claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 92; Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In particular, with respect to KPCL, CP is presently refusing to pay over $12 million admitted to be due and owing to KPCL for work KPCL performed on the Project, on the basis of an alleged set-off arising out of its claims in the Alberta Action,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;E&rdquo; KPCL Holdback Application.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and claims set-off for payment of this amount in the Statement of Claim in the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This directly affects KPCL's assets and cash flow, which in turn impacts its bonding capacity and ongoing operations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit para 92; Notice to Admit to CP, Schedule &ldquo;F&rdquo; Panteluk Saskatchewan Affidavit, para 64; Percy Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>111. The delay in the past few years in obtaining trial dates in Alberta has been recognized by the Alberta Court of Appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, for example <CASEREF><SOC>NEP Canada ULC v MEC Op LLC</SOC><CITE>2016 ABCA 201</CITE><PARANUM>1</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 47</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The evidence is that, as of February 2018, trials over 10 days were currently booking into 2021 in Alberta, and into 2019 in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clearly, the parties are likely to achieve a significantly more timely resolution of the dispute in Saskatchewan. A stay of this Action in favour of Saskatchewan is consistent with Alberta's foundational rules.</P>
<P>112. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Impact on Other Proceedings / Possibility of Conflicting Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>113. A multiplicity of proceedings, and the prospect of conflicting judgments, is to be avoided.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Attorney General) v Malik</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 48</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>114. The Saskatchewan Action and the KPCL Holdback Application are extant in Saskatchewan. The parties continue to wait for the Saskatchewan Court's decision on the CP Application, the Second CP Application and the KPCL Holdback Application.</P>
<P>115. This Action, and the Saskatchewan Proceedings, while they do not perfectly overlap and have unique features, arise out of the same Project and have overlapping issues. The Saskatchewan proceedings and the Alberta proceedings are also directly linked by CP through its claim, in the Alberta Action, of set-off against its obligation to pay the holdback that is the subject of the KPCL Holdback Application.</P>
<P>116. If the Alberta Action proceeds, there will overlapping issues, evidence, and the prospect for inconsistent factual findings or judgments. The potential for duplication and inconsistent results can be avoided by staying the Alberta Action and allowing CP to pursue its claims in the jurisdiction that has the real and substantial connection with the dispute, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>117. The same is not true if the Alberta Action is allowed to proceed. The assumption of jurisdiction by Alberta, while it will be relevant to the Saskatchewan Court, will not bind the Saskatchewan Court which may nonetheless assume jurisdiction and refuse to stay the Saskatchewan Proceedings given the very strong connection between the dispute and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Teck Cominco Metals Ltd v Lloyd's Underwriters</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 11</CITE><PARANUM>29</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 49</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>118. Further, only the Saskatchewan Court has jurisdiction to hear or grant relief pursuant to the Saskatchewan <EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>, including the relief sought by KPCL in the KPCL Holdback Application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, SS 1984-85-86, c B-7.1, sections 2(c), 17, 38, 86-96 [<EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 50</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The only place that all issues between KCPL and CP can be resolved, and the efficient place for any issues between CP and the other Defendants in the Alberta Action to be resolved, is in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>119. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Costs / Prejudice</UNDER></TI>
<P>120. The Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or declining the stay, are relevant factors to consider in the determination of the most convenient forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 110 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>]; <EM>Lapointe</EM> at para 53 [<BOLD>Tab 8</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>121. In this case, the costs and prejudice if the Alberta Action proceeds are significant. As set out earlier, there will be significant witness costs and inefficiencies; significant evidentiary inefficiencies and costs relating to physical records and the real evidence at the Project site; significant delay and its associated costs and prejudice; and the high probability of duplicative proceedings (and their associated costs)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 84.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> with the prospect of conflicting decisions.</P>
<P>122. In addition to these general costs, there will be significant prejudice to KPCL and Clifton. It will be unduly burdensome to their business to have their senior management out of the office for lengthy periods of time as they attend to the Alberta Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 90; Clifton Affidavit, para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL is a mid-sized, family run business, and CP's allegations are very serious and will potentially damage KPCL's future reputation and ability to generate new business.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 87.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such hardship to a smaller business is a relevant consideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Salus Marine Wear Inc v Queen Charlotte Lodge Ltd</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 3063</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 51</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>123. CP is a large Canadian public railway company and its offices are located across Canada (which includes employee accommodations located in Moose Jaw and offices in Saskatchewan near the Project and in Regina).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 91; Clifton Affidavit, para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has filed no evidence of any prejudice to CP if the Alberta Action is stayed. The costs of litigation, given the locations of the witnesses and the evidence, would very likely be lower for all parties if the matter proceeds in Saskatchewan. There is no evidence of any harm or prejudice to any other parties if the Alberta Action is stayed.</P>
<P>124. It is obvious that any impact on CP, if the stay is granted, is minor compared to the impact on KPCL and Clifton specifically, and all of the parties generally, if the stay is not granted.</P>
<P>125. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Problems Relating to Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>126. There are no anticipated issues regarding the recognition of a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts. KPCL has no presence or assets in Alberta to enforce against.</P>
<P>127. This factor is neutral.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Location of Cause of Action and Damage</UNDER></TI>
<P>128. The Action relates to a foundation failure on a Project which was and is entirely located within the Province of Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, for example, <CASEREF><SOC>BC Rail Partnership v Standard Car Truck Co</SOC><CITE>2003 BCSC 150</CITE><PARANUM>51</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>BC Rail Partnership</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 52</BOLD>], where the Court relied on the location of a train-car derailment accident as an important factor supporting the exercise of jurisdiction.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The alleged negligence was committed in Saskatchewan (with the possible exception of the misrepresentation claims against Clifton which may have occurred in Ontario). Again, it is beyond doubt that the &ldquo;place most substantially affected by the respondent's activities or its consequences&rdquo; is Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gulevich</EM> at para 46 [<BOLD>Tab 14</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, the preponderance of evidence is that design work, all of the implementation of the design work, the physical construction work, and the regular design and site meetings, all occurred in Saskatchewan, or on the phone with parties in Saskatchewan, such that any alleged breaches of contract occurred in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, Exhibits &ldquo;16&rdquo; and &ldquo;17&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>129. The damages CP claims all relate to the costs of investigating the failure in Saskatchewan, and the costs to redesign and reconstruct the Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, para 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>130. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Applicable Law</UNDER></TI>
<P>131.

<P>132. This factor is neutral.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Parties' Choice or Preferred Forum</UNDER></TI>
<P>133. <UNDER>KPCL Prefers Saskatchewan</UNDER>. KPCL was the first party to choose a forum for a dispute related to the Project, when it filed the Saskatchewan Action first-in-time, in August 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 70.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While this factor has been given some weight,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Billing v Precisioneering DKG Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 270</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 57</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Colonial Countertops Ltd v Maple Terrazzo Marble &amp; Tile Incorporated</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 752</CITE><PARANUM>75-76</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 58</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL acknowledges that the first-to-file is not a strong factor, by itself, in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis.</P>
<P>134. <UNDER>CP Prefers Alberta</UNDER>. CP chose to file the Action in Alberta, four months after KPCL filed the Saskatchewan Action. CP's choice of forum should be given little weight. First, as noted earlier, the plaintiff's choice of forum should never come at the cost of one party facing unfair or clearly inefficient proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Haaretz</EM> at para 47 [<BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, it is KPCL's position that CP has also attorned to the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan courts through the filing of the CP Application and the Second CP Application, both of which invoked the inherent jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court and sought a remedy from the Saskatchewan Court other than challenging the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lindblom v Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>2001 ABCA 102</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 59</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Bedard v Bedard</SOC><CITE>2004 SKCA 101</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 60</BOLD>]; Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;, Notice of Application of CP filed February 28, 2018, para 1, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;, Notice of Application of CP filed March 13, 2018, paras 1&ndash;6. The parties await the decision of the Saskatchewan Court on this issue.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Third, as will be discussed further below, CP structured its affairs in its contracts with Thurber, Hatch and Clifton so as to attempt provide itself a contractual option to engage in forum shopping&mdash;attempting to bind its counterparties to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts but &ldquo;without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice to Admit to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Affidavit of Justin Meyer dated March 12, 2018, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;; Notice to Admit facts to CP, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Affidavit of Justin Meyer dated March 12, 2018, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Forum shopping is not to be encouraged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Amchem Products Incorporated v British Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board)</SOC><CITE>[1993] 1 SCR 897</CITE><PAGENUM>at 912 and 920</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 61</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>135. <UNDER>Intact Prefers Saskatchewan</UNDER>. Intact, like KPCL, is not fettered by a choice of forum clause, and supports the stay of the Alberta Action in favour of Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Application.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>136. <UNDER>Hatch and Clifton Prefer Saskatchewan</UNDER>. Hatch and Clifton both prefer that the Action be stayed in favour of Saskatchewan. CP will undoubtedly attempt to rely on the &ldquo;Governing Law&rdquo; clauses in the Clifton Contract and the Hatch Contract, which respectively provide:
<QUOTE><P>26. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. <UNDER>The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.</UNDER> The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. <UNDER>The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction</UNDER>. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibit&rdquo;B&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>137. With respect, these provisions should be given little, if any, weight, in the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis for a number of reasons. First, in order for a forum selection clause to be binding on the parties, the clause &ldquo;must be mandatory and must clearly and precisely confer exclusive jurisdiction on the foreign authority&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>GreCon Dimter Inc. v JR Normand Inc</SOC><CITE>[2005] 2 SCR 401</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 62</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses have &ldquo;lesser strength&rdquo; than exclusive attornment clauses and do not need to be deferred to.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>BC Rail Partnership</EM> at para 27 [<BOLD>Tab 52</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Romanchuk v Jemi Fibre Corp</SOC><CITE>2018 SKQB 46</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Romanchuk</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 63</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here, the Hatch clause is non-exclusive. Further, given that CP reserved the right to take proceedings outside of Alberta, the Clifton clause should also be interpreted to be non-exclusive. This Court should not consider these clauses binding.</P>
<P>138. Even if these clauses are exclusive, this Court is not obligated to enforce them. First, the Court must determine whether the forum selection clause is enforceable and applies to the circumstances; and second, the Court must assess whether there is strong cause in favour of denying a stay, despite the enforceable forum selection clause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>[2003] 1 SCR 450</CITE><PAGENUM>at 462</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 64</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Douez v Facebook Inc</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 33</CITE><PARANUM>126</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Douez</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 65</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no set list of factors for a court to consider as part of assessing &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; and a court must consider &ldquo;all of the circumstances&rdquo; in this part of the test.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Douez</EM> at para 30 [<BOLD>Tab 65</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>139. In this case, the forum clause does not apply to tort claims, so, at best it only partially applies. Further, even if the clauses apply, when there are non-signatories involved in a claim involving a forum selection clause, it can be a factor for the second part of the test and constitutes a &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce. The fair treatment of a group of litigants, some of whom are signatories to a choice of forum contract and some of whom are non-signatories may be an exceptional circumstance requiring that a contractual choice be overridden.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1400467 Alberta Ltd v Adderley</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 339</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 66</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Aldo Group Inc v Moneris Solutions Corporation</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 725</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Aldo</EM>] [<BOLD>Tab 67</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Chateau Des Charmes Wines Ltd v Sabate, USA Inc</SOC><CITE>[2005] OJ No 4604</CITE><PARANUM>28 and 43</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 68</BOLD>]; <CASEREF><SOC>Skyway Canada Ltd v Clara Industrial Services Ltd</SOC><CITE>[2005] OJ No 4887</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 69</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is particularly so if it is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Magill v Expedia Canada Corporation</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 5247</CITE><PARANUM>55</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 70</BOLD>]; <EM>Yara Belle</EM> at para 79 [<BOLD>Tab 56</BOLD>]; See, for example: <CASEREF><SOC>Emkay Canada Fleet Services Corp v Imperial Oil</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 2710</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Tab 71</BOLD>] where the Court refused to sever the applicant from a multi-party proceeding, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had a forum selection clause stipulating Alberta.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or where it would result in &ldquo;significantly less inconvenience to potential witnesses&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Multiactrve</EM> at para 29 [<BOLD>Tab 41</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>140. In this case, KPCL and Intact do not have contracts with forum selection clauses. Even if the clauses in the Hatch, Clifton and Thurber contracts apply in any way, they should not be enforced by this Court as a ground to refuse to stay the Action, due to the risk of a multiplicity of proceedings, the impact on witnesses, the substantial connection of the claim to Saskatchewan, and the public policy against forum shopping. These words in <EM>Romanchuk</EM> are appropriate here:
<QUOTE><P>Secondly, had I applied the <EM>Pompey</EM> test, I would also have found that the plaintiff has shown &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; as to why the forum selection clause should not be enforced. As stated above, the contract was solicited, negotiated, signed and performed in Saskatchewan. The evidence related to these issues is in Saskatchewan. At all material times, the defendants were actively carrying on business in Saskatchewan. Having considered all of the circumstances, including the &ldquo;convenience of the parties, fairness between the parties and the interests of justice&rdquo; (Pompey, paras 19, 30 and 31), I find that the plaintiff has shown strong cause as to why the court should not defer to the clause in this instance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Romanchuk</EM> at para 34 [<BOLD>Tab 63</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>141. <UNDER>Thurber and Altus</UNDER>. Thurber and Altus' preference as to forum is unknown. While they have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court, this does not necessarily mean that they object to the staying of the Action in favour of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>142. Here, four of the seven parties to this Action favour Saskatchewan. Only CP actively asserts that this Court should assume jurisdiction.</P>
<P>143. This factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>144. The loss of juridical advantage within the Canadian federation should not be given undue weight.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM> at para 112 [<BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this case, other than has already been addressed above, KPCL does not assert a juridical advantage or disadvantage in either jurisdiction.</P>
<P>145. This factor is neutral.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Relative Strength of the Connection of the Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>146. As set out above, this factor favours Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Summary of Factors</UNDER></TI>
<P>147. When all of the unique factors are considered, KPCL submits that Saskatchewan is clearly the more appropriate forum for this dispute, as summarized below:

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. At issue in this application is whether this claim, which was appropriately filed by Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in the Alberta Courts and which has a real and substantial connection to Alberta, should nonetheless be transferred to Saskatchewan to suit the interests of the single defendant formally domiciled there.</P>
<P>2. CP, a federal corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, filed the Statement of Claim in this Action on December 1, 2017. In its Statement of Claim, CP sets out causes of action against defendants spread across Canada. The claim involves allegations of breach of contract and negligence arising out of the design and construction of a rail spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan that forms part of CP's national rail network (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP moved forward with the litigation, serving its Statement of Claim on the various defendants between January 8 and January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>3. The defendants are located across Canada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Four of the six defendants have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, with two of those having filed defences and one filing Notices to Co-defendants.</P>
<P>4. Despite this, certain of the defendants&mdash;including two who have contractually attorned&mdash;have chosen to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably in an effort to create delay and inconvenience to CP in the handling of this Action.</P>
<P>5. There is, however, no basis upon which to set aside this claim in which two defendants have already defended and have brought no motions to challenge jurisdiction or strike the claim. There is a real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which this Action is based, and the parties not resident in Alberta are necessary and proper parties to this Action</P>
<P>6. While the Belle Plaine Project was constructed in Saskatchewan, the bulk of the design and engineering work was completed in Alberta. The majority of those <UNDER>likely</UNDER> to be questioned or to appear as witnesses at trial are either in Alberta or are in jurisdictions other than Saskatchewan, with the result that comparative convenience either favours proceeding in Alberta, or is a neutral factor. The law applicable to several of the contracts at issue is the law of Alberta, where all but one of the parties to this Action carry on business and where many of the physical records regarding this claim are located.</P>
<P>7. Efficiency and fairness also favour proceeding in Alberta. All of the principal actors involved in the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project are parties to this Action, and the most reasonable means to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings is to allow this Action to proceed in the usual course. Further, given the number of individuals the parties have already identified as likely to be required for Questioning, Alberta's more robust Rules regarding Questioning are better suited to allowing the complex facts underlying this claim to be brought to light, which will assist in the assessment and potential resolution of the claims.</P>
<P>8. The fact that the Saskatchewan Courts also have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the subject matter of this claim does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court and, given the strong connection of the parties and the subject matter of this litigation to Alberta, Saskatchewan cannot be shown to be a clearly more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>9. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project was underway from 2012 to 2017. To facilitate construction, CP contracted with the defendants, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) to provide engineering and construction services.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the failures on the part of Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL and Altus (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork embankment adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River collapsed (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks.</P>
<P>11. CP initiated the within Action to recover the damages it suffered as a result of the Embankment Failure. CP's Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Defendant Contractors is liable to CP for breach of contract and in negligence. The Statement of Claim also alleges negligent misrepresentation as against Clifton and advances a breach of contract claim against Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), which issued a performance bond in respect of KPCL's work.</P>
<P>12. CP is a federal corporation with its registered office and headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. With few exceptions, the majority of the CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;Panteluk Affidavit&rdquo;), paras 18 and 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project. CP's allegations as against Hatch in respect of the deficiencies in Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project sound in both contract and tort.</P>
<P>14. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton sworn March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 8 and Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Effective January 1, 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Hatch contracted to provide professional engineering services as required by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Although Hatch initially sought to have its work on the Belle Plaine Project formalized through a distinct contract between itself and CP, it subsequently <UNDER>requested</UNDER> that its work on the Belle Plaine Project be brought within the existing Hatch Contract. CP's acceptance of the Hatch proposal was expressly subject to Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project being undertaken pursuant to the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibits F, G and H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Hatch carries on business in Alberta, with offices in both Calgary and Edmonton,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 12 to the Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;McArdle Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and conducted the initial design work for the Belle Plaine Project at its office in Calgary, Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This was in keeping with the proposal Hatch provided for the work on the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;), which identified 11 individuals as the personnel who would be working on the design and engineering of the Belle Plaine Project, all but two of whom were in Alberta (with none in Saskatchewan).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, para 6 and Schedule A at pages 20&ndash;32, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The Hatch Contract reflects the express agreement between Hatch and CP as to the law that would govern and the forum in which disputes would be determined, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch dated January 1, 2012 (&ldquo;Hatch Contract&rdquo;), section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The vast majority of the Hatch employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project, including the Project Managers, Directors and Engineers, were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hatch's Project Manager for the Belle Plaine Project was based in Calgary throughout the period while Hatch was performing the work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, including at the time of the Embankment Failure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 5; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. As set out in the Hatch Proposal, although Hatch was to be the &ldquo;prime consultant&rdquo; and would rely on its &ldquo;strong, multi-discipline Calgary-based team&rdquo;, Hatch also proposed retaining its &ldquo;exclusive subconsultants&rdquo;, including Thurber, to assist with work on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit at para 6 and Schedule A at page 33, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its contractual obligations to CP under the Hatch Contract, Hatch was required to ensure that any subcontractors strictly adhered to all of the terms of the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 6 of Schedule A, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Thurber, which is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was retained by Hatch pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd., filed April 5, 2018 at para 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice to Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Thurber Engineering Ltd. are attached as Appendix A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Thurber carries on business in Alberta and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP/Thurber Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Thurber Corporation dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On April 5, 2018, Thurber filed a Statement of Defence and Notices of Claim against Co-Defendants in this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd. and Notice to Co-defendants filed April 5, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Through its Notices to Co-defendants, Thurber is seeking contribution and indemnity from each of the other defendants in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact.</P>
<P>23. Clifton was also involved in providing geotechnical and environmental engineering services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Clifton provided construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Clifton is a federal corporation which maintains its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan and has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 2 and 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Supply of Services Retainer into which CP and Clifton had entered effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Retainer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 6 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Correspondence between CP and Clifton in respect of the Clifton Retainer was exchanged between their respective offices in Calgary and Regina. After having been executed on behalf of Clifton, the Clifton Retainer was executed and accepted by CP in Calgary and returned to Clifton by mail or courier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The Clifton Retainer prescribes the applicable law and jurisdiction:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Later, on April 8, 2015, CP and Clifton entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) under which Clifton was to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11; Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Clifton dated April 8, 2016 (&ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Like the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract reflects the express agreement between CP and Clifton prescribing the law applicable to the Clifton Contract and the forum in which disputes would be adjudicated, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project involved a significant earthworks component, in respect of which CP contracted with KPCL.</P>
<P>31. KPCL provides both construction and earthmoving services and was the main construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 5, 7 and 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's contractual responsibilities pursuant to the contract in place between it and CP included the construction of the Qu-Appelle River crossing and adjacent embankments,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> one of which is the subject matter of this Action.</P>
<P>32. Throughout the course of its work on the Belle Plaine Project and, indeed, until approximately one month after KPCL was served with the Statement of Claim in this Action, KPCL was registered in Alberta as an extra-provincial corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; First Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of KPCL dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 6, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. Altus, which is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta and maintains its head office within Alberta, provided survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project under an agreement between CP and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, paras 3 and 4. A copy of the Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership is attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On April 27, 2018, Altus filed a Statement of Defence to this Action. While Altus has not filed Notices to Co-defendants, in its Statement of Defence, Altus pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c C-27 and the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c T-5.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix B: Statement of Defence on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. Intact is the only defendant to this Action not directly involved in the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project. The Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL required KPCL to provide CP with a performance bond through a duly licensed surety company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL dated March 12, 2015 (&ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;), section GC35, Exhibit 8 to the Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Intact was selected as that company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Intact, a federally regulated company,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carries on business and maintains offices in Alberta and is licensed to provide insurance in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories dated June 12 2018 (&ldquo;Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 1&ndash;3, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. On or about May 28, 2015, Intact issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP for the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Performance Bond issued by Intact to KPCL on May 28, 2015, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Percy Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Despite having guaranteed the performance of KPCL's obligations with respect to the Belle Plaine Project, which included construction of the embankment that failed, Intact has refused to act upon the bond to address KPCL's defaults. Intact's failure to honour its obligations under the performance bond left CP in the position of having to fund all of the work in connection with KPCL's failures, without the benefit of the bond provided.</P>
<P>39. KPCL alleges that proceedings in Alberta will have a detrimental impact on KPCL's finances and its operations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g. Panteluk Affidavit, paras 85 and 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet has remarkably refused to provide any of its financial information,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 28, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to Second Notice to Admit Facts dated June 8, 2018, para 5, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the inference being that the financial information would not support the allegations. In a similar vein, Intact initially provided sworn evidence that this dispute is presently having an impact on the bonding support Intact is able to provide to KPCL,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet both KPCL and Intact have since confirmed that no such impact has been felt.</P>
<P>40. KPCL, for its part, concedes that it has not turned down any jobs, or declined to bid on any jobs, due to unavailability of bonding support or limitations on the scope of bonding available to it, whether through Intact or any other surety provider.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 11, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 5 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, Intact has confirmed that at no time between January 1, 2016 and April 2018 has it refused any request for bonding from KPCL, nor has it reduced the amount of any bond issued to KPCL or otherwise limited the scope of bonding available to KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 4 and 6, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, the allegations of financial impact have no substantiation.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. CP's Statement of Claim was served soon after it was filed, as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was served in Estevan, Saskatchewan on January 10, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) Thurber was served in Victoria, British Columbia on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch was served in Mississauga, Ontario on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Intact was served in Calgary, Alberta on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(e) Altus was served in Edmonton, Alberta on January 11, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Clifton was served in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 19, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>42. On February 6, 2018, almost a full month after service of the Statement of Claim in this Action, counsel for KPCL sought confirmation that an extension would be granted in respect of KPCL's Statement of Defence and that CP would not take any steps against KPCL in the interim. It is surely not a coincidence that until February 6, 2018, KPCL was registered with Alberta Registries as an extra-provincial corporation in the province of Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule A, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, paras 6 and 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Unbeknownst to CP, KPCL had previously filed a Statement of Claim against CP in Regina in Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 2177/2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;). Like the within Action, KPCL's Saskatchewan Action concerns the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>44. Although KPCL's Saskatchewan Action was filed in August 2017, KPCL took no steps to serve the claim at that point, but instead waited more than five months, including almost a full month <UNDER>after</UNDER> CP served the Statement of Claim in this Action upon KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 1, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 5, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Interestingly, it was not until February 7, 2018, after having secured CP's agreement to an extension in respect of its own Statement of Defence, that KPCL served CP with the KPCL Saskatchewan Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule B, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Upon receipt of KPCL's Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, CP immediately advised KPCL that it considered jurisdiction to be an issue in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action. Indeed, KPCL already knew that, as CP had initiated this Action in Alberta. On February 9, 2018, in the interests of efficiency and practicality, CP proposed that the jurisdictional issues in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action be addressed as part of KPCL's planned application in respect of jurisdiction before this Court, obviating the need for a duplicate application before the Saskatchewan Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule C, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and thereby minimizing the cost and time associated with trying to deal with similar motions in separate jurisdictions.</P>
<P>46. KPCL refused. Rather, KPCL insisted that it was unable to consider CP's proposal until CP had filed an application of its own challenging jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, presumably for strategic reasons. KPCL also refused CP's request for an extension of time in respect of CP's Statement of Defence in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule D, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. Indeed, although KPCL filed its application challenging jurisdiction on February 8, 2018, it subsequently took the position that it was unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, Exhibits N-II, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only after forcing a court appearance to address scheduling were the Jurisdiction Applications set down for July 4 and 5, 2018.</P>
<P>48. Despite the existence of not only CP's claim in the within Action, but its own claim in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, both of which raise issues in respect of the obligations between CP and KPCL on the Belle Plaine Project and the performance of those obligations, on March 5, 2018 KPCL filed yet another claim against CP by way of Originating Application under Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 655/2018, seeking payment of holdback funds relating to the Belle Plaine Project (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 16 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. CP sought a stay of the need to challenge jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and KPCL's Originating Application (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Actions</BOLD>&rdquo;), pending the determination of the Jurisdiction Applications. CP's application was heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow in Regina on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit, paras 4 - 5 .</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Justice Chow was advised of KPCL's pending jurisdictional challenge before the Alberta Courts. CP argued that the need to bring an application in Saskatchewan to challenge jurisdiction was contrary to the foundational Rules in Saskatchewan and Alberta of trying to address matters in an efficient and cost effective manner, when the precise issue was to be determined in Alberta on July 4 and 5. KPCL, through its opposition to that and in filing further claims in Saskatchewan, seems opposed to the suggestion of efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>50. CP has not yet filed an application challenging jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and, accordingly, such applications&mdash;should they become necessary&mdash;have not yet been set down, let alone heard. It follows that neither of the Saskatchewan Actions have yet been set down for hearing.</P>
<P>51. On December 1, 2017, CP also filed a claim as against Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;) in QB Action No. 1701-16251 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh Action</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A copy of the Statement of Claim filed on behalf of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in QB Action No. 1701-16251 is attached as Appendix C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Marsh Action also concerns the Belle Plaine Project, but is specific to CP's allegations that breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of Marsh, which provided insurance brokerage services to CP, including in respect of insurance on the Belle Plaine Project, have resulted in damages to CP.</P>
<P>52. Marsh has undertaken to defend in the March Action and will not be challenging jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. DISCUSSION</TI>
<P>53. The analysis of the jurisdictional questions raised in respect of this Action has two distinct parts: the first addresses the jurisdiction of the Court <EM>simpliciter</EM>, while the second concerns the issue of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Haaretz</EM></BOLD>], para 27, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>101&ndash;105</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Van Breda</EM></BOLD>] <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. Jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is based upon the existence of a real and substantial connection between the forum and the subject matter of an action, as demonstrated by the presence of one or more presumptive connecting factors. To rebut a presumed real and substantial connection, the party challenging jurisdiction must establish that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the claim is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction.&rdquo; The factors upon which the party seeking to rebut a presumed real and substantial connection should not be those considered during the second stage of the analysis, as the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is, and must remain, distinct.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 43, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 56, 81, 92 and 97</P1></P>
<P>55. Once jurisdiction is established through the real and substantial connection test, the claim will proceed in that jurisdiction unless a party challenging jurisdiction is able to show that exceptional circumstances exist such that another jurisdiction is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; The bar is high&mdash;the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that:
<QUOTE><P>The use of the words &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo; should be interpreted as an acknowledgment that the normal state of affairs is that jurisdiction should be exercised once it is properly assumed. ... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 46, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 109</P1></P>
<P>56. Assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is multi-factorial and requires a Court to consider the overall fairness and efficiency of proceeding in one jurisdiction as opposed to another, as determined based on factors ranging from the law applicable to the dispute to the location of physical evidence to the comparative convenience and expense for the parties and likely witnesses.</P>
<P>57. In this instance, the presumptive connecting factors between this claim and Alberta ground the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> of the Alberta courts and there is no sound basis upon which the applying defendants may rebut this presumption.</P>
<P>58. Further, the applying defendants have failed to show that this matter invokes the exceptional circumstances that justify a determination that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum in which to have this Action heard.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> by Consent</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. In this instance, four of the six defendants (Thurber, Altus, Clifton and Hatch) have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. That fact, in itself, is sufficient to resolve the question of whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, to the extent that any such question truly arose. The real and substantial connection is between the forum and the subject of the action, not a particular or specific party.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Governing Principles</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. Parties are always at liberty to consent to a Court's jurisdiction. As confirmed by this Honourable Court, consent:
<QUOTE><P>permits jurisdiction over an extra-provincial defendant who consents, whether by voluntary submission, <UNDER><EM>attornment by appearance and defence</EM>, or prior agreement</UNDER> to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the domestic court.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Limited v Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 ABQB 442</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Norex</EM></BOLD>], para 49, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt et al v Carcelles et al</SOC><CITE>2002 OJ No 2128</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 19 [italicized emphasis in original, underline emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. If a party attorns, or consents contractually or otherwise to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the matter.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc v Research In Motion Ltd</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Meta4Hand</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. Participation in the litigation process also constitutes attornment, and it is well established that when a party defends a lawsuit on the merits, it has implicitly submitted or attorned to the jurisdiction of the court in which the action was brought.
<P1><EM>Norex</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50</P1>

<P>63. It is also open to parties to enter into commercial agreements regarding the forum in which disputes between them are to be adjudicated, and it is &ldquo;essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding contracting parties to [such] agreements.&rdquo; Where there is a valid agreement that includes an agreement as to jurisdiction, consideration of whether there is a real and substantial connection to the forum is redundant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>ZI Pompey</EM></BOLD>], paras 20 and 21, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD></P1>

<P>64. Forum selection clauses are a distinct element in consideration of jurisdiction, and should not be subsumed within the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. Further, forum selection clauses should be enforced unless there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to do so. In this respect, the burden is on the party challenging jurisdiction to &ldquo;show sufficiently strong reasons to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just in the circumstances to require the [challenging party] to adhere to the terms of the clause.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>ZI Pompey</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 20, 21 and 39</P1></P>
<P>65. Inconvenience does not amount to strong cause. It is, for example, not open to parties who have entered into a contractual agreement with respect to forum to complain later that the evidence and witnesses may not be within that jurisdiction. Such facts either were or ought to have been known prior to entering into the agreement containing the forum selection provision and, to the extent that posed a concern, the appropriate time to raise the issue is at the time of contract negotiation. Allowing the location of witnesses and evidence to be raised after the fact would undermine commercially negotiated agreements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Atlantic Cement Carriers Ltd v Atlantic Towing Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 761</CITE><PARANUM>21 and 24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. In terms of their substance, forum selection clauses fall along a spectrum, from contracts which contain no such provisions to those which contain exclusive jurisdiction provisions under which the parties choose a single forum for the adjudication of disputes.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v Megawheels Technologies Inc</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 4493</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Megawheels</EM></BOLD>], para 19, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. While even an exclusive attornment provision does not oust the jurisdiction of a local court, courts give significant weight to exclusive attornment provisions and should not interfere with the parties' selection of forum attornment provisions &ldquo;unless it is shown that the matter cannot be properly dealt with in the foreign court.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 20</P1></P>
<P>68. Non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions also carry significant weight. In <CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp. v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Virtue described such clauses as &ldquo;important consideration[s]&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; in the context of a forum selection clause means that the parties have attorned to that jurisdiction &ldquo;except in matters where some extraordinary condition or reason would require that the matter be determined elsewhere.&rdquo; Once a suit arises in the selected jurisdiction, the parties will be required to attorn.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>136 AR 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 28, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 10</BOLD></P1>

<P>69. Unsurprisingly, the operation of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is more limited in scope than that of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Essentially, under a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, &ldquo;either party may sue the other wherever it has the right to do so&rdquo;, but once one party initiates a suit in the named jurisdiction, the other party must keep its bargain by attorning to that jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 28</P1></P>
<P>70. While a forum selection clause must be applicable to the dispute in question in order to be given effect, it is inappropriate to parse the wordings of forum selection clauses too closely to determine whether they apply to the claims as pleaded, as this can foster &ldquo;dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution.&rdquo; Courts interpret jurisdiction clauses broadly, and have rejected an approach in which fine distinctions are drawn based upon the language used.
<P1>Rafferty and Pitel, <EM>Conflict of Laws</EM>, 2nd ed (Irwin law: Toronto, 2010) at 131-132, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 12</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12</P1></P>
<P>71. Where a claim of negligence has arisen in a contractual relationship based upon an agreement which contains a forum selection clause, the forum selection is equally applicable to a claim in tort unless the clause clearly does <UNDER>not</UNDER> cover the dispute.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12-11-13</P1></P>
<P>72. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered a claim in which the plaintiff had entered into two contracts with the defendants, one of which contained a forum selection clause through which the parties agreed that &ldquo;any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this Agreement&rdquo; was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and the other of which contained no forum selection clause. The plaintiff sued in Ontario for negligent misrepresentation based upon the second contract. The defendants successfully sought a stay based upon the forum selection provision in the other contract, with the Court concluding that the claims in negligence were intertwined with the contract, making it inevitable that the contract would be before the court as part of the factual narrative and through the reliance of the defendants upon the contract in their defences, such that there was no basis not to enforce the forum selection provision.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 2823</CITE><PARANUM>1, 2, 14 and 29</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 13</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>73. Thurber and Altus, having filed Statements of Defence that address the substance of the claims against them, have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. The claims against them arising from the Belle Plains Project will proceed in Alberta. As well, the notices for contribution and indemnity will also, presumably, proceed.</P>
<P>74. Hatch and Clifton have also attorned, through their respective contracts with CP, to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts in respect of this Action.</P>
<P>75. The validity of the Clifton Retainer, Clifton Contract and Hatch Contract is unchallenged, and there is no suggestion that this matter cannot properly be dealt with by the Alberta Courts.</P>
<P>76. Clifton and CP attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract. Under the Clifton Retainer, CP and Clifton &ldquo;attorn[ed] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Contract, for its part, stipulates that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reflecting Clifton's attornment to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>77. Both Hatch and CP attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts through the Hatch Contract, which states that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The attornment provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract contain no limitation as to subject matter scope. Certainly, they contain nothing that would suggest that they &ldquo;clearly [do] not&rdquo; cover claims in either breach of contract or tort, and it would be absurd to suggest that these provisions do not apply to breaches of the very contracts in which they appear.</P>
<P>79. This is consistent with the wording of the attornment provisions. In each of these Contracts, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is a long and detailed contract, expressly including not just the portion containing the terms in which the forum selection provisions are set out, but associated schedules providing descriptions of services, minimum requirements for personnel, security requirements, and other details regarding the work to be performed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, page 1, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit; Clifton Retainer, page 1, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, page 1, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More importantly, through the Hatch Contract, the Clifton Contract and the Clifton Retainer, Clifton and Hatch expressly agreed to provide services, meaning their engineering and design work in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; bringing not only contractual interpretation but the performance of the contract squarely within <UNDER>all</UNDER> of the terms of the Agreements, including the forum selection provision.</P>
<P>80. The proper interpretation of a forum selection clause was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the contractual duty of good faith, and alternatively for breach of agency duty and wrongful dismissal. The defendant applied for a stay of the action in British Columbia based upon the forum selection provision in the contract between the parties, which read:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Saskatchewan in respect of its interpretation or breach.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1700</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>81. The claim launched was almost wholly unrelated to either the interpretation or breach of the contract that contained the jurisdiction clause, with the Court noting that it was not a case in which the parties &ldquo;had a difference of opinion over the interpretation of the contract or alleged the other to be in breach of it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 53</P1></P>
<P>82. That is in sharp contrast to the present situation.</P>
<P>83. Here, there is no limitation upon the scope of the attornment provisions. Clifton and Hatch suggest that the absence of a limitation somehow indicates that the provisions are limited to interpretation. This, with respect, is a transparent effort to create ambiguity where none exists and should not be permitted.</P>
<P>84. CP, Clifton and Hatch have attorned (either exclusively or nonexclusively) to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;full stop. That attornment is, as suggested by the whole of each provision, in respect of the &ldquo;Agreements.&rdquo; CP's claims against both Hatch and Clifton expressly allege that those defendants are in breach of their respective Agreements with CP, bringing the claims directly within the scope of the forum selection provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Contract and Clifton Retainer.</P>
<P>85. The Clifton Contract contains an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, as there is no suggestion that this claim cannot be properly dealt with by the Alberta Courts, there is no reason to interfere with this contractual provision.</P>
<P>86. The Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer contain non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions. Given that CP has filed the Statement of Claim in the within Action in Alberta&mdash;the selected forum&mdash;both Clifton and Hatch are contractually bound to the jurisdiction.</P>
<P>87. To the extent that this Honourable Court finds that the wording of the forum selection provision in the Clifton Contract allowed CP to begin proceedings in other jurisdiction affects the exclusivity of the provision in respect of Clifton (rather than CP alone, per the wording of the clause), the only result would be to transform the provision into one in which both parties had attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The provision would then operate in the same way as the provisions within the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer, meaning that Clifton would be required to attorn to CP's Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>88. In addition to the breach of contract claims set out in CP's Statement of Claim, claims of negligence have arisen within CP's contractual relationships with both Hatch and Clifton. CP's claims in contract and tort are intertwined, making this a situation in which the contractual attornment provisions are applicable to both.</P>
<P>89. For the foregoing reasons, the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> based upon the consent of Thurber, Altus, Hatch and Clifton. There is no reason, let alone strong cause, to oust this jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Via Real and Substantial Connection</UNDER></TI>
<P>90. A court has jurisdiction over an action if there is a real and substantial connection between the action and the court's territory. The assumption of jurisdiction is justified under the real and substantial connection test where objective factors, as identified by the courts, connect the plaintiff's claim to the chosen forum. It is not necessary to show the <UNDER>most</UNDER> real and substantial connection, only that such a connection exists.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 4</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 15</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ayles v Arsenault</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 493</CITE><PARANUM>21, 23 and 27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Ayles</EM></BOLD>] citing <CASEREF><SOC>Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye</SOC><CITE>[1990] 3 SCR 1077</CITE><PARANUM>43-44</PARANUM></CASEREF> amongst others, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>91. Further, a real and substantial connection between one alleged cause of action and the jurisdiction is sufficient to ground a Court's jurisdiction over the whole. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, Justice LeBel was explicit on this point, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>it is possible for a case to sound both in contract and in tort or to invoke more than one tort. Would a court be limited to hearing the specific part of the case that can be directly connected with the jurisdiction? Such a rule would breach the principles of fairness and efficiency on which the assumption of jurisdiction is based. The purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation and the defendant. If such a connection exists in respect of a factual and legal situation, the court must assume jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. The plaintiff should not be obliged to litigate a tort claim in Manitoba and a related claim for restitution in Nova Scotia. That would be incompatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 99</P1></P>
<P>92. The following factors were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 90</P1></P>
<P>93. Where one of the factors giving rise to a real and substantial connection is present, the defendant bears the burden of rebutting the presumed connection. Rebutting the presumption, however, requires the party challenging jurisdiction to show that the connection is so weak that it would not be reasonable for that party to expect to be called to answer proceedings in the forum with which the real and substantial connection exists.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 95 and 97</P1>
<P1><EM>Ayles</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 27</P1></P>
<P>94. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada also recognized that, where there is a real and substantial connection for the purpose of satisfying the applicable rule for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection may be presumed to exist. While procedural directives such as the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> do not <UNDER>establish</UNDER> jurisdiction, they &ldquo;represent an expression of wisdom and experience drawn from the life of the law&rdquo; and &ldquo;are based on objective facts that may also indicate when courts can properly assume jurisdiction.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 43 and 83</P1></P>
<P>95. In Alberta, the factors to be considered in assessing whether service <EM>ex juris</EM> is appropriate are set out in Rule 11.25(3), which states in part that:
<QUOTE><P>... in the following circumstances a real and substantial connection is presumed to exist: ...</P>
<P>(b) the claim relates to a contract or alleged contract made, performed or breached in Alberta;</P>
<P>(c) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta;...</P>
<P>(d) the claim relates to a tort committed in Alberta;...</P>
<P>(g) the defendant is resident in Alberta; ...</P>
<P>(i) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta Reg 124/2010, rule 11.25(3) [<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>96. The analysis of jurisdiction simpliciter set out in <EM>Van Breda</EM> and the procedural rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM> are to be integrated in reaching a decision as to jurisdiction. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court concluded that for the purpose of service, the &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; connecting factor is a presumptive connecting factor where the subject matter of the action is connected to Alberta and the other principal players in the dispute are Alberta corporations. This only makes sense, otherwise different claims, involving different parties would need to be litigated in different jurisdictions even though they arise from a common set of facts. That could not, to use Justice Lebel's words, be compatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Arcis</BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>97. In <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc. v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Farrington relied upon <EM>Arcis</EM> as a post-<EM>Van Breda</EM> case that specifically retains &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; as a presumptive connecting factor, grounding a finding that the Court had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in part on the necessary and proper party connection.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 402</CITE><PARANUM>26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Jebco</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>98. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility</SOC></CASEREF> this Court affirmed that the factors set out in Rule 11. 25(3), including whether a defendant is a proper and necessary party, constitute presumptive real and substantial connections for the purpose of a jurisdictional analysis.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 36</CITE><PARANUM>54 and 59</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>99. Accordingly, factors establishing a presumptive real and substantial connection include:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) a contract connected with the dispute was made, performed or breached in the province;</P>
<P>(d) the tort was committed in the province;</P>
<P>(e) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta; and</P>
<P>(f) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>100. In addition, while the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not a <EM>prima facie</EM> connecting factor, in <EM>Van Breda</EM> the Court suggested that the plaintiff's location is nonetheless relevant, stating that the:
<QUOTE><P>... presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not, <UNDER>on its own</UNDER>, a sufficient connecting factor. ... <UNDER>Absent other considerations,</UNDER> the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction will not create a presumptive relationship between the forum and either the subject matter of the litigation or the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 86 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>101. In this case, while CP's presence in Alberta does not, on its own, establish the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, the fact that CP is resident and carries on business in Alberta is a further factor in favour of maintaining Alberta jurisdiction.</P>

<P>106. CP's Statement of Claim is also connected to a contract made in Alberta.</P>
<P>107. A contract need not be one to which the plaintiff in a proceeding is a party to be a contract &ldquo;connected&rdquo; with the Action.

<P>108. Thurber was retained by Hatch to provide geotechnical services for the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 4; Subcontract Agreement between Hatch and Thurber dated November 27, 2012 (&ldquo;Thurber Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber Contract was made between two parties who have identified themselves as within Alberta,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, preamble at page 1, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and was signed by individuals confirmed to have been in Alberta during the course of the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Correspondence from Thurber to Hatch in which the contract was negotiated was sent from Thurber's office in Calgary to Hatch's office in Edmonton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, Exhibit B, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>109. In its Statement of Claim, CP raises allegations in respect of the Thurber Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 71&ndash;76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its defence, Thurber, in turn, relies upon the allegation that it met all of its obligations under the Thurber Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>110. The Thurber Contract was made in Alberta and is connected to the subject matter of this dispute&mdash;this amounts to another presumptive real and substantial connection with Alberta.</P>
<P>111. Performance of a contract in Alberta is, equally, a presumptive real and substantial connection factor. Performance of a contract involves the fulfillment of an obligation or a promise under that contract.
<P1><EM>Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary</EM>, 7th ed., <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>112. In this case, both Hatch and Thurber had contractual obligations to perform engineering and geotechnical work on behalf of CP as part of the Belle Plaine Project. That work was carried out in Alberta.</P>
<P>113. Hatch employees involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the initial design work performed by Hatch was done within its office in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>114. Similarly, all of the Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit at paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>115. The work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, which was the driving purpose underlying the Hatch Contract, was performed in Alberta. Likewise, Thurber's work under the Thurber Contract, through which it provided engineering and geotechnical work for the Belle Plaine Project, occurred within Alberta. The performance of these contracts in Alberta constitutes a further real and substantial connection between Alberta and this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Tort Committed in the Province</UNDER></TI>
<P>116. In addition to its claims in breach of contract and tort, CP alleges that Clifton is liable for negligent misrepresentations contained within the proposal Clifton submitted prior to the execution of the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 91<EM>ff</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>117. The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs where the representation is received or acted upon. It is, moreover, foreseeable that misrepresentations sent to a plaintiff's office in one jurisdiction would be received and relied upon by the plaintiff in another province. If the defendant foresees that its representations will be received or acted upon within a particular jurisdiction, it should expect to be called to account in proceedings in that jurisdiction. As explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal, &ldquo;[i]n the modem world where corporations have various offices in various locations, corporate defendants should not escape liability simply because they send studies [the studies being the source of the alleged misrepresentation] to an office of the plaintiff outside Ontario with the clear understanding that it will be acted on in Ontario.&rdquo;

<P>118. The CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were predominantly in Alberta as the Belle Plaine Project was being designed and constructed. Clifton cannot have expected anything other than that its proposal for the Belle Plaine Project, which contained the misrepresentations upon which CP relied, would be acted upon within Alberta, especially as Clifton had communicated with CP in Calgary in respect of the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 8 and 15; Affidavit of Wayne Clifton sworn June 15, 2018, para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clifton met with CP in Calgary to discuss its work prior to providing the proposal containing the misrepresentations<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 9 and 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and agreed to provide all applicable notices under the Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract to CP in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 24 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, section 25 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit,.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P>119. The applicability of Alberta law is a further factor establishing the real and substantial connection between this Action and Alberta that grounds the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 11.25(3)</P1></P>
<P>120. The Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract, and the Hatch Contract are all governed by the law of Alberta, pursuant to the following stipulation:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit; Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>121. The role of Alberta law in these agreements is a further factor giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection between Alberta and this claim.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Necessary and Proper Parties to the Alberta Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>122. The test for determining whether an extra-territorial defendant is a necessary and proper party to a claim so as to confer jurisdiction turns on whether:
<QUOTE><P>supposing both parties had been within the jurisdiction would they both have been proper parties to the action? If they would, and only one of them is in this country, then the rule says that the other may be served, just as if he had been within the jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>123. The &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; factor is a presumptive connecting factor for the purposes of determining jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.

<P>124. Altus is an Alberta corporation and was served in Alberta. The only question under this factor in the analysis is whether the other defendants, had they been in Alberta, would have been proper parties to the claim.</P>
<P>125. The answer to this question in respect of each of the other defendants is resoundingly yes.</P>
<P>126. Clifton concedes that it is a necessary and proper party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Brief of Law on Behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd. filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Brief&rdquo;), para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, each of the briefs filed on behalf of the Applicants appears to contemplate that if the claim were to proceed in Saskatchewan, all of the parties presently involved would continue as parties in that forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief, para 65; Brief of Law of KPCL filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Brief&rdquo;), para 102; Brief of Law of Hatch filed June 15, 2018, para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>127. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is distinct from, and irrelevant to, the question of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 27-28</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 101</P1></P>
<P>128. Where a Court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a real and substantial connection, it retains a residual discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that it is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and that another forum is preferable. The onus is on the party seeking a stay on this basis to show that an alternate forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, based not upon the preferences of the parties as KPCL suggests,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 133&ndash;136.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but upon the requirements of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 105 and 108</P1></P>
<P>129. A proper <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis does not dissect the claims in an effort to separate constituent causes of action or claims against individual parties that might, in the absence of the larger proceeding, be outside the jurisdiction of the court in which an action has been filed. Rather, where multiple claims are brought within one proceeding, the action is to be considered as a whole to assess whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, supra at 13&ndash;23</P1></P>
<P>130. As with jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing a challenge to jurisdiction based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court identified the following as potentially relevant, depending on the context:
<P1>(a) the locations of parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 110</P1></P>
<P>131. The factors identified in the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's <EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> are also relevant to assessing forum <EM>non conveniens</EM>, even where, as here, the forum challenged has not adopted that type of legislation.
<P1><EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> [<BOLD><EM>CJPTA</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 26</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breeden v Black</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 19</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Breeden</EM></BOLD>], para 23, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 27</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>132. Accordingly, the following <EM>CJPTA</EM> factors are also relevant when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum;</P1>
<P1>(b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding;</P1>
<P1>(c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts;</P1>
<P1>(e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole.</P1>
<P1><EM>Breeden</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 23, citing section 11(2) of the <EM>CJPTA</EM></P1></P>
<P>133. In cases involving more than one potentially appropriate forum, there is a presumption in favour of the forum selected by the plaintiff, which &ldquo;wins by default if there is no clearly preferable alternative.&rdquo;

<P>135. As this shows, of 48 likely witnesses CP has identified to date, 18 (or 33%) are in Saskatchewan, 16 are in Alberta, and the remainder are either outside both jurisdictions or in unknown locations.</P>
<P>136. Regardless of the jurisdiction in which this Action is heard, it will undoubtedly be inconvenient for witnesses to travel from one jurisdiction to another for questioning and, eventually, trial. Moreover, there will be expenses associated with that process. CP is certainly prepared to assist in minimizing both the cost and inconvenience by attending upon witnesses in their own jurisdictions for questioning, as may be reasonable.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>137. The parties to this claim are located in Alberta (CP and Altus), Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton), British Columbia (Thurber) and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact has, for the purpose of this application, filed an Affidavit from an individual in Alberta, but is a federally regulated corporation. See Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>138. It would be inconvenient for Clifton and KPCL to have this claim proceed in Alberta, and it would be equally inconvenient for CP and Altus to litigate in Saskatchewan, rendering this a neutral factor.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Records</UNDER></TI>
<P>139. In terms of the available evidence, it is only to be expected that many of the records regarding the Belle Plaine Project will be electronically accessible from virtually any jurisdiction, including Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 30, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 5-6, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>140. That said, physical records also exist regarding the parties work on the Belle Plaine Project. While some of the defendants have their physical records for the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan, Hatch, which provided the primary engineering services for the design of the Belle Plaine Project, has physical records mostly located in Alberta, with <UNDER>none</UNDER> in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 3&mdash;4, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>141. Regardless of where this Action proceeds, witnesses and parties will be inconvenienced. Expenses will be incurred. There is no basis upon which to assume that travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta is more expensive or inconvenient than travel in the other direction, and the parties, witnesses and records are balanced as between Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Cost of Transfer</UNDER></TI>
<P>142. At this stage, there would be little cost associated with a transfer of either the Saskatchewan Actions to Alberta or with transferring this Action to Saskatchewan, recognizing that two defendants have already defended the Alberta action and they may have issues with being somehow forced into Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(e)</N><TI>Comparative Convenience/Expense</TI>
<P>143. However, the comparative convenience of proceeding in Alberta as opposed to Saskatchewan cannot be considered without reference to the forum selection clauses that apply to Hatch and Clifton, as outlined above. As explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd. v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>it must be the rare case where [balance of convenience and expense] alone is so overwhelming as to be determinative if all other considerations are largely neutral or would dictate that the parties' agreement be upheld. That must be particularly so when, as here, the choice is between two common law jurisdictions in this country. A party who resides or carries on business in British Columbia but who agrees to litigate disputes in the courts of another province must be taken to have accepted at the time the agreement was made that there could be a significant measure of inconvenience and expense associated with geographical distances. That party should not then, without more, be easily relieved of the contractual obligation it agreed to bear.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1996] BCJ No. 2148</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 29</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>144. If only the locations of the likely witnesses, the parties and the records regarding this claim were taken into account, the assessment of comparative convenience weighs slightly in favour of Alberta. However, once the jurisdiction clauses are also considered, as they must be, it is clear that neither Hatch nor Clifton ought to be relieved of any additional inconvenience or expense associated with the contractual agreements they accepted. As a result, on the whole, this factor weighs strongly in favour of Alberta's jurisdiction over this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Law to be Applied</UNDER></TI>
<P>145. The law to be applied to the claims in breach of contract as against Hatch and Clifton is unquestionably the law of Alberta, which is also applicable to the claim of negligent misrepresentation against Clifton and claims in relation to the Thurber Contract. There is, moreover, no reason that if an Alberta court was required to apply Saskatchewan law it could not do so, even in respect of claims requiring interpretation of Saskatchewan legislation such as <EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, which CP says has no application in any event in the within matters.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kerr Interior Systems Ltd v Kenroc Building and Materials Co Ltd</SOC><CITE>2009 ABCA 240</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 30</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, SS 1984-85-86, c B-7.1, [<BOLD><EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 31</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>146. While the law of Saskatchewan may apply to some of CP's claims in tort depending on how the Court construes the place where the tort occurred, and potentially to CP's claims in contract as against KPCL and Intact, Alberta courts could apply that law without issue, which would be no different than the Saskatchewan courts being called upon to apply Alberta law in accordance with the choice of law provisions if this Action were to be transferred to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>147. In either event, the general law of contract and tort are essentially the same in both places, rendering this a neutral factor.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Yara Belle Plaine Inc v Ingersoll-Rand Company et al</SOC><CITE>2014 SKQB 254</CITE><PARANUM>76</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 32</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>148. This factor is neutral, as a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts would be recognized in the other jurisdiction. Enforcement will be facilitated by the <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c R-6 and <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSS 1978, c R-3.

<P1><EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSS 1978, c R-3, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 34</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Avoiding Multiplicity of Legal Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>149. Rule 1.2(2) of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> highlights the importance of efficiency in Court proceedings, a goal that is even more important in view of the scarcity of judicial resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Generally, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is more efficient in terms of the proceedings themselves and in the use of judicial resources.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 1.2(2)</P1></P>
<P>150. In this case, KPCL itself has, it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions by filing the Originating Application in the face of its own Saskatchewan Action, seeking through both claims further payments in respect of KPCL's work on the Belle Plaine Project and corresponding determinations of KPCL's alleged rights under the KPCL Contract, all of which are raised squarely in this Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>151. It is questionable whether KPCL's second action was commenced genuinely or reflects an effort to bootstrap the current jurisdiction motion. KPCL, if it was looking for efficiency or cost-effectiveness or to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, could equally have simply added its claim in respect of holdback funds under the KPCL Contract to the KPCL Saskatchewan Action or, of course, to the present claim.</P>
<P>152. In addition to <UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity, the substance of the KPCL Originating Application is also questionable. No lien can arise in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, which constitutes a federal undertaking.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Co v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 35</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>153. In the absence of a lien, KPCL is not a &ldquo;lien claimant&rdquo;, as defined within the Builders' Lien Act, and so is not entitled to the remedies available to lien claimants thereunder. Moreover, it is not a trustee or the beneficiary of a trust within the meaning of the Builders' Lien Act. As a result, the remedies KPCL seeks in the KPCL Originating Application are simply unavailable to it, which again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action for such in Saskatchewan, given its jurisdictional challenge was, in February of this year, set for hearing in early July.
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at ss 6(2), 17(1)(a), 38(6) and (7)</P1></P>
<P>154. In addition to having launched multiple actions regarding essentially the same subject matter, which in the usual course would amount to an abuse of process, KPCL has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications in different provinces, with its principal noting that he &ldquo;would like the Saskatchewan court to have the opportunity to address whether it will exercise jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, para 35, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> despite the fact that KPCL is in the process of having this Honourable Court consider the very same question.</P>
<P>155. Multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided. That is axiomatic. This basic principle, which reflects the inherent interest in efficiency, is embedded not only in the <EM>Rules</EM> but also in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2 (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). As confirmed in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, as a corollary to the principle that multiple proceedings regarding the same issues should be avoided, another of the Court's objectives is to ensure that all issues in controversy between the parties are determined as completely and finally as possible. This is the case in every province.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, ss 5(3)(f) and 8, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 36</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>156. In these circumstances, the twin objectives of avoiding multiple proceedings and allowing all issues to be determined as completely and finally as possible militates in favour of allowing this Action to proceed in Alberta, where all of the likely parties to the claim are already parties to the Action, four of the defendants have consented to the Court's jurisdiction, and the remaining two are not only defendants to CP's Statement of Claim but also respondents to a Notice to Co-defendants.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Efficiency</UNDER></TI>
<P>157. CP wasted no time in proceeding with its claim in Alberta. KPCL, in contrast, waited 5 months to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, to which it now points as a parallel proceeding warranting transfer of the within Action to Saskatchewan, until CP's Action had been filed and served, and even then served the KPCL Saskatchewan Action only two days before KPCL's defence was due in this Action. KPCL then served a further proceeding against CP by way of Originating Application, which overlaps significantly with the issues in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and this claim.</P>
<P>158. This Action has, from the outset, included Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact as Defendants. KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, is against only CP. To bring this Action within the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, CP would have to initiate a Counterclaim against KPCL and claim against Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, Altus and Intact as parties, but this is already underway in this Action.</P>
<P>159. Then, of course, the question will arise about the propriety of dragging Altus and Thurber to Saskatchewan, when they have defended in Alberta. On the other hand, if the Action proceeds in Alberta, the issues will all be addressed, against all relevant parties, in one Action</P>
<P>160. Allowing this Action to proceed will also allow determination of the issues in the Saskatchewan Actions, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplicative proceedings. The issues are, in substance, the same, as they relate to issues arising from the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. KPCL should not be rewarded for having waited to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action or for filing a further duplicative claim by being allowed to rely on the Saskatchewan Actions as reason to transfer this Action out of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>161. While CP recognizes that juridical advantage is of less weight in assessing jurisdiction as between provinces than in an international context, in this instance proceedings in Alberta, CP's chosen forum, offer two juridical benefits. There is no basis upon which to deprive CP of either.</P>
<P>162. One is a benefit to all parties in the context of this litigation. Under the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, there is no formal limit to the number of corporate witnesses who may be questioned. In contrast, under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, parties are entitled to question only one representative of a corporation in the absence of a Court Order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., filed March 29, 2018, para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While CP expects that this would be addressed by agreement amongst counsel, given the complex and highly technical nature of the subject matter of this claim, it is important to ensure that fulsome questioning is available.</P>
<P>163. Further, if this Action is stayed or set aside, the defendants may attempt to argue that CP is barred from proceeding with an action in Saskatchewan by virtue of <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, which may be the actual motivation behind KPCL's multiplicity of actions and applications. In contrast, there is no question that CP's Statement of Claim in this Action was filed and served within the appropriate time. It would, to put it mildly, be a significant loss of the juridical advantage of proceeding in Alberta if CP were to find itself time barred in an alternate forum.</P>
<P>164. If this Court determines that CP's choice of forum and the submission to jurisdiction of Thurber and Altus should be disregarded, and concludes that the jurisdictional provisions in the contracts between CP and Hatch and CP and Clifton need not be honoured, any resulting transfer of this Action should be undertaken pursuant to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Attornment to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>165. Taking steps to contest the substantive merits of a claim is the principal hallmark of attornment. Filing an application to object to the jurisdiction of the forum is not attornment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Manson v Canada (Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 212</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 37</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>166. The suggestion that this Action be stayed or set aside in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan appears to ignore the fact that a portion of CP's claim will remain within the jurisdiction. CP's Statement of Claim against Thurber and Altus is separate and apart from the Jurisdiction Applications. These claims, as well as any claims arising under the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, will need to be addressed in any event.</P>
<P>167. CP intentionally has not, to this point, taken any steps to contest the merits of either of the Saskatchewan Actions. Rather, CP has sought only to address initial matters preliminary to potential applications in respect of jurisdiction. This does not constitute attornment.</P>
<P>168. In <CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC></CASEREF>, the defendant brought a motion to stay the Plaintiff's action in Ontario, and submitted that Quebec was the more appropriate forum for the action. The plaintiff filed his action in Ontario, then the defendant brought a parallel action in Quebec. After both actions had commenced, the plaintiff brought a motion for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief. That relief was granted. In the course of granting a stay of the Ontario action, the Court explained that:
<QUOTE><P>the defendant has not attorned to the Ontario Court's jurisdiction but <UNDER>was required to respond to the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief</UNDER> because the plaintiff refused the defendant's request for an adjournment of the plaintiff's motion and to permit her first to bring a motion to contest the forum. As such, <UNDER>the defendant came before [the justice hearing the injunction motion] under duress</UNDER>, after clearly signalling her intention to contest jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 5827</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2012 ONCA 391</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> [emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 38</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>169. Similarly, in this case CP was required to respond to KPCL's Originating Application, as KPCL had amply demonstrated its unwillingness to adjourn pending the hearing of its existing Jurisdiction Application. CP has, from its first interactions with KPCL, signalled its intention to contest jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and has taken no steps to contest the merits of either matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><TI>Remedy claimed or sought:</TI>
<P><P1>1. An Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY (&ldquo;<EM>CP</EM>&rdquo;), as against the Defendant, CLIFTON ASSOCIATES LTD. (&ldquo;<EM>Clifton</EM>&rdquo;), for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>2. Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in relation to the whole of the action, and an Order staying it in its entirety against Clifton;</P1>
<P1>3. Costs of this Application; and</P1>
<P1>4. Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Grounds for making this application:</TI>
<P><P1>5. Clifton supports the application of its Co-Defendant, KELLY PANTELUK CONSTRUCTION LTD. (&ldquo;<EM>KPCL</EM>&rdquo;), filed on February 8, 2018, to set aside the Statement of Claim for want of jurisdiction or stay this Action on the basis that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> (the &ldquo;<EM>KPCL Stay Application</EM>&rdquo;). To the extent that the grounds raised by KPCL are applicable, Clifton restates and relies on them in making this Application.</P1>
<P1>6. There is no &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo; connection between Alberta and CP's claims against Clifton in this action; therefore, the Alberta Court does not have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over them.</P1>
<P1>7. While the Supply of Services Agreement between Clifton and CP (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Agreement</EM>&rdquo;) contains a &ldquo;forum selection&rdquo; clause (the &ldquo;<EM>Forum Selection Clause</EM>&rdquo;), the Forum Selection Clause is invalid, unclear, and unenforceable. Moreover, the Forum Selection Clause does not apply to the &ldquo;Clifton Misrepresentations&rdquo; and/or any cause of action unrelated to the interpretation and/or breach of the Clifton Agreement.</P1>
<P1>8. In the event that the Forum Selection Clause is found to be valid, clear, enforceable, and applicable to some or all of CP's claims against Clifton, which is denied, Clifton states that there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the Forum Selection Clause because:
<P2>(a) The Clifton Agreement was drafted by CP without an ability or opportunity for Clifton to negotiate the Forum Selection Clause;</P2>
<P2>(b) Not all of the current or potential parties to this action are bound by similar forum selection clauses in favour of Alberta;</P2>
<P2>(c) As stated in the KPCL Stay Application, KPCL has commenced an action against CP in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench related to the same construction project, in which it is anticipated that Clifton will be involved as a witness or otherwise. If the action is not stayed in Alberta, there would be a multiplicity of proceedings in different jurisdictions, and to its prejudice, Clifton would be exposed to significant costs and inconvenience; and</P2>
<P2>(d) If CP intends to pursue claims to which the Forum Selection Clause does not apply, a bifurcation and severance of issues between it and Clifton may be necessary, resulting in a multiplicity of proceedings in different jurisdictions if this Action is not stayed. Extensive, unnecessary costs and inconvenience would correspondingly be experienced by all parties.</P2></P1>
<P1>9. Further, and in the alternative, if the Alberta Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over any or all of CP's claims, which is denied, Alberta is not an appropriate or convenient, or the clearly most appropriate or convenient, forum to adjudicate the whole of this action. As such, Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> because:
<P2>(a) The subject matter of this action is a construction project based entirely in Saskatchewan;</P2>
<P2>(b) There will likely be a multiplicity of proceedings and a risk of conflicting judgments since not all of the current or potential parties to this action are bound by forum selection clauses in favour of Alberta. As indicated, litigation involving KPCL and CP already exists in Saskatchewan related to the same construction project. It is anticipated, and expected, that the other parties to this action may become involved in that Saskatchewan litigation and/or other possible litigation in relation to the Saskatchewan construction project between other parties to this action;</P2>
<P2>(c) Clifton's head office is located in Regina, Saskatchewan, and all of its witnesses are located in Saskatchewan;</P2>
<P2>(d) The majority of the potential fact witnesses reside in Saskatchewan, and few of the potential witnesses reside in Alberta;</P2>
<P2>(e) Most of the potential evidence is located in Saskatchewan, and little of the potential evidence is located in Alberta;</P2>
<P2>(f) It is fair, just, and convenient for this action to be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan should CP make an application to transfer these proceedings;</P2>
<P2>(g) Clifton will suffer prejudice and harm if the action is not stayed in Alberta, and CP will suffer no such prejudice or harm if it is transferred by CP to Saskatchewan; and</P2>
<P2>(h) Trial time may be available earlier in Saskatchewan.</P2></P1>
<P1>10. Clifton has not filed a Statement of Defence in this action or otherwise attorned to the jurisdiction of Alberta Courts if the Forum Selection clause is found to be invalid, unclear, and unenforceable.</P1>
<P1>11. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Material or evidence to be relied on:</TI>
<P><P1>12. Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk, filed February 8, 2018;</P1>
<P1>13. Affidavit of Wayne Clifton, to be filed; and</P1>
<P1>14. Such further and other evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Applicable rules:</TI>
<P><P1>15. Rules 1.4(2)(h), 1.5(1)(a), 3.30(a) and (b), 3.68(1)(b) and (d), 3.68(2), 6.2, 10.29(1), 11.25, and 11.31, and such other Rules as counsel may advise.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Applicable Acts and Regulations:</TI>
<P><P1>16. None.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Any irregularity complained of or objection relied on:</TI>
<P><P1>17. This Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over CP's claims against Clifton. Clifton brings this Application expressly without attorning to the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.</P1>
<P1>18. With respect to the entirety of the within action, Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>How the application is proposed to be heard or considered:</TI>
<P><P1>19. In person.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>WARNING</TI>
<P>If you do not come to Court either in person or by your lawyer, the Court may give the applicant(s) what they want in your absence. You will be bound by any order that the Court makes. If you want to take part in this application, you or your lawyer must attend in Court on the date and at the time shown at the beginning of the form. If you intend to give evidence in response to the application, you must reply by filing an affidavit or other evidence with the Court and serving a copy of that affidavit or other evidence on the applicant(s) a reasonable time before the application is to be heard or considered.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Belle Plaine Project</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. From my review of the Statement of Claim filed in this Action, I understand that the project at issue in this litigation is the construction of a railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo;, for Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<EM>CP</EM>&rdquo;) between CP's existing Kalium Spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, and the K+S potash mine near Bethune, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;<EM>Belle Plaine Project</EM>&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Pre-Clifton Agreement Services</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. Clifton became involved with the Belle Plaine Project in the spring of 2014. At that time, Stephen Cross of CP requested that I review geotechnical reports by Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<EM>Thurber</EM>&rdquo;) regarding concerns related to design issues on the Belle Plaine Project. This review was completed pursuant to a five-year Supply of Services Retainer Agreement between CP and Clifton effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<EM>Supply of Services Retainer</EM>&rdquo;). A copy of the Supply of Services Retainer is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Affidavit.</P>
<P>7. The Supply of Services Retainer was negotiated between Allen Kelly, Geotechnical Lead at Clifton, and Glenn Whitham, Specialist Sourcing Engineering at CP. Mr. Kelly at all material times was based in Clifton's Regina office. Mr. Whitham was at all material times based in CP's Mississauga, Ontario office. All negotiations were by email and telephone; no Clifton personnel were required to meet or travel outside the Clifton Regina office to conclude the Supply of Services Retainer.</P>
<P>8. When the negotiation of the Supply of Services Retainer was complete, Catherine Finnie of CP emailed a copy of the Supply of Services Retainer to me and Mr. Kelly for execution. I executed three copies of the Supply of Services Retainer and couriered them to Ms. Finnie in CP's Calgary office. Dave Sissons of CP then executed the Supply of Services Retainer and the fully executed copy was couriered or mailed to Clifton's Regina office. Mr. Sissons of CP was at all material times based in CP's Calgary office.</P>
<P>9. The review of the Thurber design reports was performed by me, with some assistance from Clifton's Regina office staff, in Clifton's Regina office. I met once with representatives of CP, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<EM>Hatch</EM>&rdquo;), and Thurber in Calgary to discuss the results of my review. That is the only meeting a Clifton representative attended outside of Saskatchewan during the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>10. Clifton did no further work on the Belle Plaine Project until it signed the Clifton Agreement (as defined below).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Clifton Agreement</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. Pursuant to a Supply of Services Agreement dated April 8, 2015 (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Agreement</EM>&rdquo;), CP hired Clifton to provide certain geotechnical and environmental engineering services and grade construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project. A copy of the Clifton Agreement is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Affidavit.</P>
<P>12. Mr. Whitham of CP issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Geotechnical/Environmental Services by email dated March 17, 2015. A copy of that RFP is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Affidavit. Clifton subsequently submitted a Proposal for Professional Engineering/Environmental Services (the &ldquo;<EM>Proposal</EM>&rdquo;) by email dated March 31, 2015 to Mr. Whitham. A copy of the Proposal is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Affidavit. All of Clifton's work on the Proposal was done by email or telephone from Clifton's Regina office.</P>
<P>13. On or about April 8, 2015, Mr. Whitham of CP emailed a letter to Jason Gasmo of Clifton's Regina office accepting Clifton's Proposal. A copy of the April 8, 2015 letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Affidavit.</P>
<P>14. On or about April 9, 2015, I signed a copy of the April 8, 2015 letter and returned it to Mr. Whitham via email.</P>
<P>15. The Clifton Agreement was subsequently executed by Justin Meyer, General Manager, Capital Planning, of CP on April 15, 2015. Mr. Meyer was at all material times based out of CP's Calgary office. Mr. Meyer emailed a copy of the Clifton Agreement executed by him to me, and I executed it on April 16, 2015 and returned the signature pages to Mr. Whitham via email.</P>
<P>16. Clifton did not have an opportunity to negotiate the terms of Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; (General Terms and Conditions) of the Clifton Agreement.</P>
<P>17. On April 9, 2015, during a teleconference between CP (Chris Bunce, Stephen Cross, Hui Gao), Hatch (Andrew Paton, Kate Halverson) and Clifton (me, Jason Gasmo, Allen Kelly), CP advised Clifton that, in addition to the Description of Services in Appendix B, Clifton was now appointed the Geotechnical Engineer of Record for the Belle Plaine Project and would be responsible for all geotechnical aspects of design and construction. I assumed the position of Geotechnical Lead with overall responsibility for delivery of all geotechnical engineering services on the Belle Plaine Project.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Clifton's Work was Performed in Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. All of Clifton's work under the Clifton Agreement was performed in Saskatchewan, either by Clifton personnel working out of Clifton's Regina office or by Clifton personnel on site.</P>
<P>19. During the Belle Plaine Project, there were weekly design meetings between representatives of Clifton, CP, Hatch, KPCL, and other contractors. These weekly design meetings were held either at Clifton's Regina office or on site. I have reviewed the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn on February 7, 2018 and filed in this Action on February 8, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Panteluk Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;) and confirm that the documents attached as Exhibit 16 to the Panteluk Affidavit are a sample of meeting minutes from those weekly design meetings.</P>
<P>20. During the Belle Plaine Project, there were weekly construction meetings between representatives of Clifton, CP, Hatch, KPCL, and other contractors. These meetings usually took place on site and never took place outside of Saskatchewan. I have reviewed Exhibit 17 to the Panteluk Affidavit and confirm that those documents are a sample of meeting minutes from those weekly construction meetings.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Clifton's Records and Witnesses are in Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. All of Clifton's records with respect to the Belle Plaine Project are kept in the Regina office.</P>
<P>22. The Clifton personnel who are likely to be witnesses in this Action were all based in Saskatchewan during the Belle Plaine Project, and all currently reside in Saskatchewan. The main Clifton personnel who worked on the Belle Plaine Project, where they worked during the Project, and where they reside now are listed in the following chart:

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Key Physical Evidence is Located in Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. As the foundation failure to which this Action relates took place in Saskatchewan, the key physical evidence is located in Saskatchewan. Expert witnesses will likely need to attend at the site of the failure to observe or conduct tests.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Prejudice to Clifton From Litigating in Alberta</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. If this Action proceeds in Alberta, it will cause significant prejudice and harm to Clifton. Most of the Clifton personnel who may be witnesses in this Action currently work in Clifton's Regina head office, and are senior employees of Clifton. If those witnesses are required to travel to Alberta for questioning or trial for extended periods of time, Clifton's business will be seriously disrupted. Further, the travel and lodging expenses for Clifton witnesses will be significant.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Prejudice to CP From Litigating in Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. I have reviewed paragraph 91 of the Panteluk Affidavit and believe that the statements made in that paragraph regarding the relatively minor inconvenience to CP of litigating in Saskatchewan are accurate.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>INTRODUCTION</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. In 2012, the Plaintiff, CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY (&ldquo;<EM>CP</EM>&rdquo;), began taking steps to design and construct a 31 kilometer rail spur near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. It was to originate near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, and connect CP's main rail line to a potash mine located in Saskatchewan and owned by K+S Potash Canada General Partnership (&ldquo;<EM>K+S</EM>&rdquo;). Once completed, CP could then provide rail transportation services for potash mined by K+S.</P>
<P>2. The Defendants in this action were all retained by CP to complete various portions of the work associated with the construction of the rail spur, which included a crossing of approximately 3.7 kilometers across the Qu'Appelle River Valley in Saskatchewan. High grade earth embankments were required as part of the design (the &ldquo;<EM>Belle Plaine Project</EM>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<EM>Project</EM>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The Defendant, CLIFTON ASSOCIATES LTD. (&ldquo;<EM>Clifton</EM>&rdquo;), became involved in the Project in early 2015. Construction began on April 8, 2015, when the Defendant, KELLY PANTELUK CONSTRUCTION (&ldquo;<EM>KPCL</EM>&rdquo;), and its sub-contractors began preparing the site. Work continued throughout the year. Unfortunately, on or about December 5, 2015, there was a foundation failure which led to the collapse of an embankment under construction collapsed (the &ldquo;<EM>Foundation Failure</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk, sworn February 7, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Panteluk Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;), at para 42.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Two years later, CP commenced suit against Clifton and the other Defendants in this litigation.</P>
<P>4. The Plaintiff filed its Statement of Claim relating to the Foundation Failure in Alberta and relies on forum selection clauses in agreements with two of the six Defendants to keep it there. Clifton and its co-Applicants, KPCL, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<EM>Hatch</EM>&rdquo;), and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<EM>Intact</EM>&rdquo;), say that the Plaintiffs claim should be litigated in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The Embankment formed part of the railway spur connecting CP's Kalium Spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, to a potash mine near Bethune, Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton, sworn March 28, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;), at para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP has claimed that the cause of its collapse was &ldquo;[a]s a result of the failure of the Defendant Contractors to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim at para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CP's claim against Intact relates to a performance bond Intact issued for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim at para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. The roles of Clifton's co-Defendants' on the Belle Plaine Project were as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was the contractor responsible for most of the construction work;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 39 and 40.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) Hatch was the main consulting engineering firm;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton, sworn March 29, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Paton Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;), at Exhibit I.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<EM>Altus</EM>&rdquo;) was the surveyor;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit at para 23(d).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(d) Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<EM>Thurber</EM>&rdquo;) was the geotechnical engineer until April 2015;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit at para 23(c).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(e) Intact was the surety in respect of a labour and material payment bond and a performance bond issued to KPCL, as principal, and CP, as obligee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Trent Percy, sworn March 23, 2018 (the &ldquo;<EM>Percy Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;), at para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>7. Clifton was first involved with the Belle Plaine Project in the spring of 2014, when it reviewed geotechnical reports prepared by Thurber.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The work was done under a Supply of Services Retainer Agreement between CP and Clifton dated January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<EM>Supply of Services Retainer</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 6 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. In the spring of 2015, CP hired Clifton to provide certain geotechnical and environmental engineering services and grade construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project, and the two companies entered into a Supply of Services Agreement dated April 8, 2015, in respect of that work (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Agreement</EM>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<EM>Agreement</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Agreement contains a &ldquo;Governing Law&rdquo; clause that states:
<QUOTE><P>26. <BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury (the &ldquo;<EM>Clifton Forum Selection Clause</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 11 and Exhibit C, Page 10, Paragraph 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. The Plaintiff alleges that this is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause, meaning that the litigation must be dealt with in Alberta.</P>
<P>10. Aside from Thurber and Altus, both of which have filed Statements of Defence, none of the Defendants have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, and all are Co-Applicants by virtue of their own applications to stay the within action.</P>
<P>11. KPCL has issued a Statement of Claim in Saskatchewan for delay and impact costs and payment of Builders' Lien holdback funds.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at para 70 and Exhibit 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. The issues addressed in this Brief of Law are as follows:
<P1>(a) Does the Clifton Forum Selection Clause apply to the Claim?</P1>
<P1>(b) If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not apply to the Claim, does the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the Claim?</P1>
<P1>(c) Is the Clifton Forum Selection Clause exclusive or non-exclusive?</P1>
<P1>(d) If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is exclusive, should the Clifton Forum Selection Clause be enforced?</P1>
<P1>(e) If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is non-exclusive or is not enforced, is the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench <EM>forum conveniens</EM>?</P1></P>
<P>13. For the Court's assistance in this application, the various issues and the flow of decisions that arise from answering each of them is found in the &lsquo;decision tree&rsquo; at Tab A.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. <UNDER>LAW AND ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Applicability of Clifton Forum Selection Clause</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. The first issue this Honourable Court must determine is whether the Clifton Forum Selection Clause applies to the Claim. If it does not, then the questions are whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> and Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. Alternatively, if the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does apply, the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> analysis is not necessary as it relates to Clifton, as explained later in this Brief.</P>
<P>15. In considering whether the Clifton Forum Selection Clause applies to all of the claims made in CP's action, it is obviously necessary to consider the wording of the provision. A case in which a similar analysis was conducted is <CASEREF><SOC>Zi Corporation v Steinberg</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2006 ABQB 92</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>Zi Corp.</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 14]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In that case, the parties' agreement contained a forum selection clause that was &ldquo;....applicable to any disputes &lsquo;arising out of or relating to th[eir]...Agreement&rsquo;...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 14. [TAB 14]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> An exception was carved out in relation to an existing action between them in Florida, and the defendants applied for a stay of the Alberta proceedings. While the Court determined that the forum selection clause applied to all of the causes of action pled, it did not apply to all of the remedies sought; therefore, it stayed some of the action but allowed other claims to proceed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 44 and paras 91&ndash;96. [TAB 14]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. In considering the judicial and textbook authorities, the Court stated:
<QUOTE><P>[18] The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal [in <EM>Sarabia</EM>], finding at paragraph 25:
<QUOTE><P>The words &ldquo;arising out of&rdquo; have been interpreted generously to include non-contractual claims when they are found in a choice of forum clause in an international contract.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The Court then went on to conclude that the language in the contract was sufficiently broad to include tort claims and, as such, the forum selection provisions applied. Specifically, it held that the tort claims arose out of the contract as the parties would not have been legal neighbours in the absence of the employment contract.</P>
<P>[19] The British Columbia Court of Appeal considered this issue again in <EM>Scalas Fashions</EM>. There the forum selection provision stated that the agreement was &ldquo;in respect of all transactions in&rdquo; the plaintiff's account and that &ldquo;[a]ny disputes arising between [the parties] shall be exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Courts of [Alberta]&rdquo;: paragraph 5. The plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the causes of action were &ldquo;linked&rdquo; to the contract. Specifically, the Court found that the duty of care in tort and the fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff arose from the contractual relationship between the parties. The Court also noted that the actions in tort and contract appeared to be available on the facts alleged in the Statement of Claim. On that basis the Court gave &ldquo;any dispute&rdquo;, as those words appeared in the contract, their plain and ordinary meaning.</P>

<P>[21] Castel and Walker, in Canadian Conflict of Laws, 6th ed. (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2005) similarly observe at p. 13&ndash;57:
<QUOTE><P>Parsing jurisdiction clauses to determine whether they apply to claims as they are framed could foster dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution, which can be of considerable significance in international commercial dealings. Where a duty of care in tort, or a fiduciary duty which is alleged to have been breached has arisen in a contractual relationship that is subject to an agreement containing a jurisdiction clause, the clause should be applied unless it contains language that clearly excludes the dispute <BOLD>or it cannot be interpreted so as to cover the dispute</BOLD> [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>17. In <EM>Zi Corp.</EM> the clause reviewed in both the case itself as well as the judicial authorities all included phrasing to the effect of &ldquo;...arising out of...&rdquo; or &ldquo;...any disputes relating to or arising under this Agreement...&rdquo; In contrast, the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not specify that the parties have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Alberta in relation to <UNDER>any and all issues and matters</UNDER>. It does not state that all matters &ldquo;arising out of&rdquo; or &ldquo;any disputes relating to&rdquo; the Clifton Agreement are encompassed.</P>
<P>18. Instead, the Clifton Forum Selection Clause simply states that &ldquo;...[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 11 and Exhibit C, Page 10, Paragraph 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This statement is preceded by the statement that &ldquo;[t]his Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 11 and Exhibit C, Page 10, Paragraph 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Reading them together leads to the conclusion that the later statement regarding attornment is limited to claims involving the interpretation of the Clifton Agreement.</P>
<P>19. If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is to be interpreted in the manner suggested by the Plaintiff, then CP should have used language similar to what was used in <EM>Zi Corp.</EM> or the cases and authorities considered in that case. Given the wording of the forum selection provision in this agreement, therefore, it is Clifton's position that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause cannot be interpreted in the manner CP suggests, namely covering any and all disputes between the parties.</P>
<P>20. Even if it is interpreted as broadly as possible to include claims for breach of the Clifton Agreement and the associated concurrent claims in negligence, it simply cannot be stretched to include CP's negligent misrepresentation claims against Clifton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim at paras 91 to 97.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These claims relate to explicit and implicit representations Clifton allegedly made in its proposal and pre-date the Clifton Agreement. Consequently, the Clifton Forum Selection Clause cannot apply to any of CP's negligent misrepresentation claims against Clifton.</P>
<P>21. While it would be presumably possible to grant a remedy similar to the one in <EM>Zi Corp.</EM>, i.e.&mdash;bifurcation of issues/claims between jurisdictions, it is Clifton's position that doing so would not make sense nor promote judicial efficiency in the context of this case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> Over the Claim</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not apply to all of CP's claims, as Clifton says, then it is debatable whether the parties agreed to wholly attorn to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts regarding the claims made against Clifton. At the very least, it cannot be questioned that they have not attorned in relation to those claims to which the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not apply. Accordingly, this Honourable Court must consider whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the Claim.</P>
<P>23. The Alberta Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over a claim if there is a &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; between the claim and Alberta. This connection exists if a plaintiff establishes that a presumptive connecting factor exists <UNDER>and</UNDER> the defendant fails to rebut the presumption by showing:
<QUOTE><P>...that the presumptive connecting factor does not point to any real relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum or points only to a weak relationship between them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd. v Van Breda</SOC><CITE>[2012] 1 SCR 572</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2012 SCC 17 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>80, 81, and 95</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Van Breda</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 4]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. CP asserts in its Statement of Claim that the following presumptive connecting factors exist:
<P1>(a) the claim relates to contracts made in Alberta;</P1>
<P1>(b) the claim relates to contracts governed by Alberta law;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch and Clifton have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench; and</P1>
<P1>(d) the Defendants who reside outside of Alberta are necessary and proper parties to the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim at para 128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>25. CP's statement that Clifton has attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench appears to refer to the Clifton Forum Selection Clause, which for the reasons given above does not apply and thus cannot give this Court jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. Instead, the other presumptive connecting factors CP alleges to exist will be addressed below.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI>Where Clifton Agreement Made</TI>
<P>26. The first presumptive connecting factor alleged by CP is that its Claim relates to contracts made in Alberta. In the case of Clifton, the contract CP refers to is the Clifton Agreement; the Supply of Services Retainer is not referenced in CP's Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>27. A contract made by means of instantaneous communication is deemed to be made in the location in which the offeror received the acceptance of the offer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Greenbuilt Group of Companies Ltd. v RMD Engineering Inc.</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 297 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>108</PARANUM></CASEREF>. <BOLD>[TAB 9]</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Agreement was therefore made in Regina because CP accepted Clifton's Proposal by emailing a letter to a Regina-based Clifton employee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, this alleged presumptive connecting factor is not applicable.</P>
<P>28. Even if CP was able to establish this presumptive connecting factor, it establishes only a feeble connection between the subject matter of this litigation and Alberta. At its heart, CP's claim is a negligence claim relating to a construction project based entirely in Saskatchewan. That fact does not change if one or more contracts for the work at issue are deemed to have been created in Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI>Governing Law of the Clifton Agreement</TI>
<P>29. Clifton concedes that the Clifton Agreement is to be interpreted according to Alberta law; however, this alleged presumptive connecting factor establishes, at best, a weak connection between the litigation and Alberta. As noted above, CP's claim is in essence a negligence claim relating to a construction project in Saskatchewan. The fact that Alberta law will be used to interpret the Clifton Agreement does not establish a meaningful connection between CP's claim and Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3.</N><TI>Necessary and Proper Party</TI>
<P>30. Clifton concedes that it is a necessary and proper party to this litigation; however, that alone is not enough to establish a meaningful connection between CP's claim and Alberta. If the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is not applicable, and none of the other alleged presumptive connecting factors apply, use of the &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; factor would effectively &lsquo;bootstrap&rsquo; jurisdiction based on nothing more than the fact that CP chose to sue in Alberta and some of the Defendants have offices in Alberta.</P>
<P>31. Since the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not apply to the Claim, and because the presumptive connecting factors alleged by CP do not establish a real and substantial connection to Alberta, this Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the Claim and should therefore stay this action.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>&ldquo;Exclusive&rdquo; or &ldquo;Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction&rdquo; Clause</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. In the event that this Honourable Court finds that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is applicable to the Claim, however, which is denied, it will be necessary to consider what type of clause it is. This is a point about which the parties do not agree. The Plaintiff contends that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause. Clifton's position is that it is not; rather, when properly interpreted, the clause is a &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; provision.</P>
<P>33. Given the variety of contracts, there is obviously a spectrum along which forum selection clauses fall. The separation between &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clauses is described by Justice Hillier in <CASEREF><SOC>TR Technologies Inc. v Verizon Communications Incorporated</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2011 ABQB 390</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>TR Technologies</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 13]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[33] The parties have referred to a number of decisions regarding non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses. The contract in <CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v. Megawheels Technologies Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2006] O.J. No. 4493</CITE><COURTJUR>Sup.Ct.Just.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> contained similar wording to the effect that Alberta law would apply and the parties irrevocably attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. Brown J. noted that contracts range from:</P>
<P>i) those containing no choice of forum clause, where the appropriate forum for the adjudication of disputes will be decided in accordance with general principles of jurisdiction, to</P>
<P>ii) those containing exclusive jurisdiction clauses, to which courts will give weight, although such clauses cannot oust the jurisdiction of a domestic court.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. After reviewing a number of cases in which various forum selection clauses were considered, Hillier further stated in <EM>TR Technologies</EM> that:
<QUOTE><P>[38] These cases generally stand for the common sense proposition that a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause must be given weight, but will not necessarily be determinative. Sugar suggests the first to file in the non-exclusive jurisdiction secures that forum. However, even exclusive jurisdiction clauses cannot oust jurisdiction...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>35. The distinction between whether the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; or a &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; contractual provision is therefore material, as it changes the analysis in Clifton's application by which the question of whether the action should be stayed as against Clifton is answered. Specifically, if the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is a &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause, then an assessment of whether the Alberta Court is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> is undertaken. If it is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause, then <EM>forum conveniens</EM> is considered <UNDER>after</UNDER> the test set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Douez v Facebook Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>[2017] 1 SCR 751</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2017 SCC 33</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>Douez</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 6]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> assuming that there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the provision.</P>
<P>36. In this case, although the Clifton Forum Selection Clause states that &ldquo;...[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta...&rdquo;, that statement is immediately followed by a qualifier: &ldquo;...without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supra</EM> note 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If CP retains the right to sue in &ldquo;any other jurisdiction&rdquo;, the use of the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; clearly does not actually mean that this is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction clause&rdquo; in the sense used in the jurisprudence, i.e.&mdash;a clause intended to prevent the parties from suing each other in any jurisdiction other than the one named.</P>
<P>37. To the extent that the meaning of the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; is ambiguous, therefore, that ambiguity should be read against CP because CP drafted the Clifton Agreement and Clifton did not have any meaningful opportunity to negotiate the Clifton Forum Selection Clause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at paras 15 and 16 and <CASEREF><SOC>Ironside v Smith</SOC><CITE>1998 ABCA 366 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>64 to 67</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Ironside</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 10]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Given the ambiguity, the Clifton Forum Selection Clause could at best be characterized as a &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction clause&rdquo;. The question to be answered thus becomes whether Alberta is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>, an issue discussed more fully below.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>Enforcement of the Clifton Forum Selection Clause</UNDER></TI>
<P>38. Notwithstanding Clifton's position to the contrary, this Brief will address CP's position that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause. In cases involving such clauses, the Court must engage in the two-step analysis recently described by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Douez</EM> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[1] Forum selection clauses purport to oust the jurisdiction of otherwise competent courts in favour of a foreign jurisdiction. To balance contractual freedom with the public good in having local courts adjudicate certain claims, courts have developed a test to determine whether such clauses should be enforced. This test has mostly been applied in commercial contexts, where forum selection clauses are generally enforced to hold sophisticated parties to their bargain, absent exceptional circumstances...</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[28] ...where no legislation overrides the clause, courts apply a two-step approach to determine whether to enforce a forum selection clause and stay an action brought contrary to it (<EM>Pompey</EM>, at para. 39). At the first step, <BOLD>the party seeking a stay based on the forum selection clause must establish that the clause is &ldquo;valid, clear and enforceable and that it applies to the cause of action before the court&rdquo;</BOLD> (<CASEREF><SOC>Preymann v. Ayus Technology Corp.</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 30 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>32 B.C.L.R. (5th) 391</CITE><PARANUM>43</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>; see also <EM>Hudye Farms</EM>, at para. 12, and <EM>Pompey</EM>, at para. 39). At this step of the analysis, the court applies the principles of contract law to determine the validity of the forum selection clause. As with any contract claim, the plaintiff may resist the enforceability of the contract by raising defences such as, for example, unconscionability, undue influence, and fraud.</P>
<P>[29] Once the party seeking the stay establishes the validity of the forum selection clause, the onus shifts to the plaintiff. At this second step of the test, <BOLD>the plaintiff must show strong reasons why the court should not enforce the forum selection clause and stay the action.</BOLD> In <EM>Pompey</EM>, this Court adopted the &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; test from the English court's decision in <EM>The &ldquo;Eleftheria&rdquo;</EM>, [1969] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 237 (Adm. Div.). In exercising its discretion at this step of the analysis, a court must consider &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo;, including the &ldquo;convenience of the parties, fairness between the parties and the interests of justice&rdquo; (<EM>Pompey</EM>, at paras. 19 and 30-31). Public policy may also be a relevant factor at this step (<CASEREF><SOC>Holt Cargo Systems Inc. v. ABC Containerline N.V. (Trustees of)</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 90 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 907</CITE><PARANUM>91</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, referred to in <EM>Pompey</EM>, at para. 39; <EM>Frey</EM>, at para. 115). [Emphasis added.]<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supra</EM> note 27 at paras 1, 28, and 29. [TAB 6]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>39. Although discussed in the context of an application to enforce a forum selection clause, the principles are equally apropos in this one. Since there is no legislation that would override the Clifton Forum Selection Clause, the two-part analysis set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Douez</EM> is necessary in the event that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause applies and is held to be an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</P>
<P>40. For the reasons given in the first section of this Brief, the Clifton Forum Selection Clause does not apply to the Claim. Even if it does, however, there is no strong reason why the Court should enforce the clause to continue this litigation in Alberta.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI>&ldquo;Strong Cause&rdquo; Not to Enforce</TI>
<P>41. The law provides that Courts may decline to enforce forum selection clauses if they have &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce them. Justice Ross of this Honourable Court described the &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; test in <CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc. v Research In Motion Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>Meta4Hand</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 11]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[40] <BOLD>The Court must take into account all relevant circumstances and issues arising under a contract to determine whether a strong cause exists to depart from the forum selection clause</BOLD>: <BOLD><EM>Pompey</EM></BOLD> at para 30.

<QUOTE><P>A forum selection clause in a commercial contract should be given effect. <BOLD>The factors that may justify departure from that general principle are few. The few factors that might be considered include the plaintiff was induced to agree to the clause by fraud or improper inducement or the contract is otherwise unenforceable, the court in the selected forum does not accept jurisdiction or otherwise is unable to deal with the claim, the claim or the circumstances that have arisen are outside of what was reasonably contemplated by the parties when they agreed to the clause, the plaintiff can no longer expect a fair trial in the selected forum due to subsequent events that could not have been reasonably anticipated, or enforcing the clause in the particular case would frustrate some clear public policy.</BOLD> Apart from circumstances such as these, a forum selection clause in a commercial contract should be enforced.</P>

[emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>42. Clifton says that, in this case, this Honourable Court should decline to enforce the Clifton Forum Selection Clause because:
<P1>(a) not all of the Defendants are bound by forum selection clauses purportedly favouring Alberta; and</P1>
<P1>(b) giving effect to the Clifton Forum Selection Clause will most assuredly result in a multiplicity of proceedings.</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Non-Signatory Defendants</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>43. One &ldquo;other applicable exceptional circumstance&rdquo; a Court may consider is the fact that the litigation involves parties to whom the forum selection clause in question does not apply (&ldquo;non-signatories&rdquo;). Justice Veit raised this as a potential factor weighing against enforcement of a forum selection clause in <CASEREF><SOC>1400467 Alberta Ltd v Adderley</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2014 ABQB 339 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>5 and 41</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Adderley</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 1]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Given that the non-signatories in that case were &ldquo;closely related with or subsidiaries of&rdquo; the signatories, the factor was not determinative; however, in considering the issue, he stated:
<QUOTE><P>[41] Perell J.'s decision in <BOLD><EM>Magill</EM></BOLD> contains the following comments:
<QUOTE><P>If the exclusive jurisdiction clause applies for the benefit of only some of the defendants, the court may decide to exercise its discretion not to enforce the exclusive jurisdiction clause to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and possible inconsistent results or to have all the necessary parties before the court...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>This case identifies a new category of potential exceptional circumstance: <BOLD>the fair treatment of a group of litigants, some of whom are signatories to a choice of forum contract and some of whom are nonsignatories may be an exceptional circumstance requiring that a contractual choice be overridden</BOLD> [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>44. An example of a case in which the involvement of non-signatories was decisive is <CASEREF><SOC>Skyway Canada Ltd v Clara Industrial Services Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2005 CanLII 42253</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>Skyway</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 12]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In that case, the subject of the litigation was a bridge restoration project that had an Ontario portion and a New York portion. The general contractor for the project hired a joint venture comprised of Safespan Systems Inc. (&ldquo;<EM>Safespan</EM>&rdquo;) and Skyway Canada Ltd. (&ldquo;<EM>Skyway Canada</EM>&rdquo;). The joint venture agreement between Safespan and Skyway Canada contained a forum selection clause in favour of New York. There were problems and delays on the project. As a result, the general contractor sued the bridge owner in Ontario, Safespan sued the general contractor in New York, and Skyway Canada sued the general contractor and Safespan in Ontario. Safespan applied to stay Skyway Canada's Ontario claim on the basis of the forum selection clause in the agreement between them.</P>
<P>45. Master MacLeod dismissed Skyway Canada's application because the dispute was largely about the prime contract, not the joint venture contract; there were &ldquo;...other parties to the dispute that...[were] not bound by the forum selection clause..&rdquo;; and &ldquo;...it would be unfair to require the other parties to litigate in New York simply because there is a forum clause in the agreement between two of the sub-trades...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 24 and 25. [TAB 12]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. In this case, not all of the Defendants are signatories to agreements with exclusive jurisdiction clauses in favour of Alberta. It would be unfair to those other Defendants to force them to litigate in Alberta simply because of a forum selection clause in CP's contract with Clifton. In essence, doing so would expose them to costs that would be avoided if the litigation proceeds in Saskatchewan. Given the caselaw, these facts provide &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the Clifton Forum Selection Clause.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Multiplicity of Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. In determining whether there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce a forum selection clause, the Court may also consider whether enforcing such clause will result in a multiplicity of proceedings. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Emkay Canada Fleet Services Corp v Imperial Oil</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2016 ONSC 2710</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [<EM>Emkay</EM>] <BOLD>[TAB 7]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the plaintiff filed a claim against ten defendants in Ontario. One of the defendants, Shell, applied to stay the claim against it on the basis of a forum selection clause in an agreement between Shell and the plaintiff in favour of the exclusive jurisdiction of Alberta. Justice Lederer dismissed Shell's application because requiring the plaintiff to litigate its claim against Shell in Alberta would lead to a multiplicity of proceedings, i.e.&mdash;the proceeding against Shell in Alberta and the proceeding against the other nine defendants in Ontario. He found that the specter of multiple proceedings was &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the forum selection clause.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 16 to 18. [TAB 7]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. In this case, KPCL has filed a claim relating to the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan. If the within action is stayed, the Courts of Saskatchewan will have an opportunity to manage CP's claim and KPCL's claim in a way that promotes judicial economy and reduces the risk of inconsistent determinations. Specifically, if it is determined to be appropriate, the claims may be managed by the same judge, jointly case managed, tried by the same judge, tried consecutively or concurrently, or consolidated. If the forum selection clause is enforced, CP's claim and KPCL's claim will have to be managed and tried separately, leading to inefficiencies and a risk of inconsistent determinations.</P>
<P>49. Further, if CP's claim against Clifton proceeds in Alberta, other parallel proceedings are likely to arise. For example, if the stay applications by KPCL, Hatch, or Intact are successful, this action will be split between Alberta and Saskatchewan. In comparison to the efficiencies achieved if the issues raised in this action are litigated in Saskatchewan, the inherent inefficiencies and risk of inconsistent decisions are apparent and overwhelmingly give rise to a &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the Clifton Forum Selection Clause.</P>
<P>50. Moreover, if this action proceeds in Alberta and it is necessary for any party to claim contribution or indemnity from a third party with no connection to Alberta, it may be difficult, or in fact impossible, to add those parties. A litigant's status as a necessary and proper party to an action may be a presumptive connecting factor. Nevertheless, that presumption can be rebutted if it does not establish a real relationship between the claim and the forum.</P>
<P>51. As discussed throughout this Brief, the connection between this Claim and Alberta is tenuous and depends almost entirely on forum selection clauses between CP and two of the Defendants, Clifton and Hatch. Consequently, this tenuous connection may not be sufficient to allow the Defendants to issue third party claims against parties who otherwise have <UNDER>no</UNDER> connection to Alberta, meaning that the Defendants could be required to file separate contribution and indemnity claims in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>52. In summary, if the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is enforced, there will be a lost opportunity to jointly manage the CP and KPCL claims to reduce inefficiency and the potential for inconsistent outcomes. Additionally, other parallel proceedings involving Defendants or third party defendants not bound by a forum selection clause in favour of Alberta may be initiated in Saskatchewan. All of these reasons provide &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce the Clifton Forum Selection Clause.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>53.

<P>54. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis has two steps.

<P>56. Given that the subject matter of this action is the failure of a foundation constructed in Saskatchewan, CP's claims against all Defendants concern either contractual obligations to be performed in Saskatchewan or torts committed in Saskatchewan. These connecting factors point to a meaningful relationship between the claims and Saskatchewan. Accordingly, Saskatchewan has territorial competence over CP's claims.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI>Saskatchewan is a More Appropriate Forum</TI>
<P>57. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada set out a non-exhaustive list of factors that may be considered in determining whether there is a more appropriate forum, which include:
<P1>(a) the locations of the parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments; and problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the loss of juridical advantage.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Van Breda</EM>, note 21 at paras 110 and 111. [TAB 4]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>58. Other factors that have been considered by Alberta courts include:

<P1>(d) the desirability of avoiding a multiplicity of legal proceedings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>59. Each of these factors will be analyzed in relation to the facts of this case.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Locations of Parties</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>60. This factor leans in favour of Saskatchewan as <EM>forum conveniens</EM> because KCPL's head office is in Saskatchewan and it does not have operations in Alberta. The remaining parties have operations in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, and the locations of their head offices are evenly split between Saskatchewan, Alberta, and other provinces, as indicated in the following chart:

</TBLNOTES></TABLE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Locations of Witnesses</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>61. This factor weighs strongly in favour of Saskatchewan. Seventy-one people who may be called as witnesses for questioning or trial have been identified.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at para 78; Clifton Affidavit at paras 22 and 24; Percy Affidavit at para 7; Hatch's response to Notice to Admit; Notice to Admit served on Thurber; Paton Affidavit at para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Of those, forty currently reside in Saskatchewan, seventeen reside in Alberta, and the balance either reside elsewhere or their residence has not been confirmed. Five of the Alberta-resident witnesses are employed by one of the Applicants, Hatch, and Mr. Paton, Hatch's affiant, states that it would be only a minor inconvenience for them to travel to Saskatchewan to give evidence.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit at para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. In contrast, KPCL and Clifton's witnesses and corporate representatives are largely key personnel based in their Saskatchewan offices, and requiring them to travel to Alberta for questioning and trial would seriously disrupt their businesses.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 86 to 90; Clifton Affidavit at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. CP has not given any evidence that requiring its seven Alberta-based witnesses to travel to Saskatchewan would be disruptive to its business.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Cost of Transferring Versus Declining Stay</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>64. This factor weighs in favour of Saskatchewan. As this litigation is in the very early stages, there should be little cost associated with transferring it to Saskatchewan. The most significant cost difference between Saskatchewan and Alberta is likely to be witness travel and accommodation costs. As stated above, most of the witnesses are Saskatchewan residents. Accordingly, the overall cost to litigate will likely be higher if the stay is refused.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Impact of Transfer on Conduct of Litigation, Parallel Proceedings, and Possibility of Conflicting Judgments</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>65. This factor weighs heavily in favour of Saskatchewan. Again, this litigation is in its very early stages, so a transfer to Saskatchewan would not affect the conduct of it. The only parallel proceedings about which we are aware are the claims KPCL has filed in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench against CP for delay and impact costs and payment of the Builders' Lien holdback, all arising out of the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 70&ndash;74.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If this Action proceeds in Alberta and KPCL's claims proceed in Saskatchewan, there is a possibility that the Alberta and Saskatchewan Courts will issue judgments that conflict on some issues or findings of fact.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>66. This factor is neutral. Alberta and Saskatchewan are reciprocating jurisdictions for the purpose of enforcing judgments.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER><EM>The Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Regulations, 1999</EM></UNDER>, SR 1999, c R-3.1, Reg 2 <BOLD>[TAB 17]</BOLD>, and <UNDER><EM>Reciprocating Jurisdictions Regulation</EM></UNDER>, AR 344/85 <BOLD>[TAB 15]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Relative Strengths of the Connections of the Parties</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>67. This factor weighs in favour of Saskatchewan, as indicated from an examination of each of the parties' circumstances.</P>
<P>68. CP has a strong connection to Alberta in that its head office is based there, yet it also has a strong connection to Saskatchewan <EM>vis-&ag;-vis</EM> the issues that arise in this litigation since the Belle Plaine Project is located in that jurisdiction.</P>
<P>69. Clifton has a strong connection to Saskatchewan in that its head office is based there and its work for the Belle Plaine Project was performed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clifton has a connection to Alberta in that it has offices in Alberta, but none of its employees in those offices worked on the Belle Plaine Project. The vast majority of Clifton's employees work in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. KPCL has a strong connection to Saskatchewan and no connection to Alberta. KPCL's offices are in Saskatchewan, and its work for the Belle Plaine Project was performed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 10, 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL has not done any work in Alberta since 1995.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>71. Hatch has strong connections to both Alberta and Saskatchewan; its head office is in Ontario, but it has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. Hatch's design work was performed in its Calgary office, but its supervisory role was performed on site in Saskatchewan. Its representatives attended project meetings in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit at paras 16 to 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. Intact's connections in respect of this matter are stronger to Saskatchewan. The bonds for the Belle Plaine Project were approved by an Intact employee who now resides in Ontario and were executed by a broker in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit at para 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There appears to be no relevant connection to Alberta other than the fact that Intact's Surety Director for the Prairies is based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit at para 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>73. Thurber has connections to both Alberta and Saskatchewan. Its head office is in British Columbia, but it has operations in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. Thurber's likely witnesses are currently resident in Alberta; however, they performed work on the Belle Plaine Project, which is located in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit at para 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. Altus has strong connections to Alberta in that it is a partnership based in Alberta, yet it has a Saskatchewan office and performed its work for the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 67, 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Altus's likely witnesses currently reside in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at para 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Loss of Juridical Advantage</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>75. This factor weighs in favour of Saskatchewan, which has procedural protections for all parties similar to those available in Alberta. In addition, the following advantages are also available in that jurisdiction:
<P1>(a) <EM>Mandatory mediation</EM>: After the close of pleadings, and before any other step is taken, all parties must attend a mediation session at the Dispute Resolution Office.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., sworn on March 28, 2018 (&ldquo;<EM>Gibbings Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;) at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This provides a structured opportunity for early settlement discussions and could help narrow the issues in dispute. Mandatory mediation adds little to no delay to the litigation, as mediation sessions are currently booking just over a month out.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gibbings Affidavit at para 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>Appearance day applications</EM>: Simple procedural applications may be done by way of appearance day application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gibbings Affidavit at para 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For appearance day applications, no affidavit is required, and the parties attend by teleconference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gibbings Affidavit at para 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) <EM>Availability of Court time for chambers applications</EM>: Chambers applications requiring up to three hours of argument may be heard in any regular chambers sitting (every Tuesday and Thursday in Regina) and booked on as little as 14 days' notice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gibbings Affidavit at para 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(d) <EM>Availability of Court time for trials</EM>: If current booking trends hold, a trial would be available two years earlier in Saskatchewan than Alberta (Calgary trials are booking into 2021; Regina trials into 2019).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 94, 95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Where the Cause of Action Arose and the Damage Occurred, and Location of the Evidence</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>76. This factor weighs in favour of Saskatchewan since the embankment that collapsed is located in Saskatchewan. This factor is particularly relevant in this case because expert witnesses will likely be required to visit the scene of the collapse to gather evidence. Additionally, a visit to the project site may be permitted as part of the trial process.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Applicable Substantive Law</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>77. This factor weighs slightly in favour of Saskatchewan. The law applicable to CP's tort claims is the law of Saskatchewan because the torts were allegedly committed in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bezan v Vander Hooft</SOC><CITE>2004 ABCA 44 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>6 and 11</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Bezan</EM>] [<BOLD>TAB 2</BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The laws of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and perhaps other provinces may apply to the various contracts at issue in this action. There are no significant differences between Saskatchewan and Alberta law on these issues, so this factor is not particularly significant.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Avoiding a Multiplicity of Proceedings</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>78. This factor weighs in favour of Saskatchewan. KPCL has filed a claim relating to the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit at paras 70 to 74.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If CP's claim is litigated in Saskatchewan, it will be possible for CP's claim and KPCL's claim to be case managed and/or tried concurrently or consecutively if it is determined to be appropriate to do so. No such opportunity will be available if CP's claim proceeds in Alberta.</P>
<P>79. For the reasons given above, the Alberta Courts are <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and this action should be stayed.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. <UNDER>CONCLUSION</UNDER></TI>
<P>80. Since the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is not applicable to at least some of CP's claim and this Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, a stay should be granted.</P>
<P>81. Alternatively, at best, the clause can be characterized as a &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause, meaning that the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> test governs. That being the case, Saskatchewan is clearly the most convenient forum in which to litigate the issues between the parties&mdash;virtually every factor weighs in its favour.</P>
<P>82. Ultimately, however, even if this Honourable Court finds that the Clifton Forum Selection Clause is an &ldquo;exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; clause, there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to enforce it. In that event, the <EM>forum conveniens</EM> test would again apply, leading to the conclusion that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and this matter must be dealt with in Saskatchewan. For all of these reasons, Clifton therefore requests that this Honourable Court grant its application to stay the action.</P>

</TBLROW>
</TBLROWS>
</TBLBODY>
</SGMLTBL></TABLE></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. At issue in this application is whether this claim, which was appropriately filed by Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in the Alberta Courts and which has a real and substantial connection to Alberta, should nonetheless be transferred to Saskatchewan to suit the interests of the single defendant formally domiciled there.</P>
<P>2. CP, a federal corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, filed the Statement of Claim in this Action on December 1, 2017. In its Statement of Claim, CP sets out causes of action against defendants spread across Canada. The claim involves allegations of breach of contract and negligence arising out of the design and construction of a rail spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan that forms part of CP's national rail network (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP moved forward with the litigation, serving its Statement of Claim on the various defendants between January 8 and January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>3. The defendants are located across Canada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Four of the six defendants have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, with two of those having filed defences and one filing Notices to Co-defendants.</P>
<P>4. Despite this, certain of the defendants&mdash;including two who have contractually attorned&mdash;have chosen to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably in an effort to create delay and inconvenience to CP in the handling of this Action.</P>
<P>5. There is, however, no basis upon which to set aside this claim in which two defendants have already defended and have brought no motions to challenge jurisdiction or strike the claim. There is a real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which this Action is based, and the parties not resident in Alberta are necessary and proper parties to this Action</P>
<P>6. While the Belle Plaine Project was constructed in Saskatchewan, the bulk of the design and engineering work was completed in Alberta. The majority of those <UNDER>likely</UNDER> to be questioned or to appear as witnesses at trial are either in Alberta or are in jurisdictions other than Saskatchewan, with the result that comparative convenience either favours proceeding in Alberta, or is a neutral factor. The law applicable to several of the contracts at issue is the law of Alberta, where all but one of the parties to this Action carry on business and where many of the physical records regarding this claim are located.</P>
<P>7. Efficiency and fairness also favour proceeding in Alberta. All of the principal actors involved in the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project are parties to this Action, and the most reasonable means to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings is to allow this Action to proceed in the usual course. Further, given the number of individuals the parties have already identified as likely to be required for Questioning, Alberta's more robust Rules regarding Questioning are better suited to allowing the complex facts underlying this claim to be brought to light, which will assist in the assessment and potential resolution of the claims.</P>
<P>8. The fact that the Saskatchewan Courts also have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the subject matter of this claim does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court and, given the strong connection of the parties and the subject matter of this litigation to Alberta, Saskatchewan cannot be shown to be a clearly more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>9. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project was underway from 2012 to 2017. To facilitate construction, CP contracted with the defendants, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) to provide engineering and construction services.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the failures on the part of Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL and Altus (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork embankment adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River collapsed (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks.</P>
<P>11. CP initiated the within Action to recover the damages it suffered as a result of the Embankment Failure. CP's Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Defendant Contractors is liable to CP for breach of contract and in negligence. The Statement of Claim also alleges negligent misrepresentation as against Clifton and advances a breach of contract claim against Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), which issued a performance bond in respect of KPCL's work.</P>
<P>12. CP is a federal corporation with its registered office and headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. With few exceptions, the majority of the CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;Panteluk Affidavit&rdquo;), paras 18 and 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project. CP's allegations as against Hatch in respect of the deficiencies in Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project sound in both contract and tort.</P>
<P>14. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton sworn March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 8 and Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Effective January 1, 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Hatch contracted to provide professional engineering services as required by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Although Hatch initially sought to have its work on the Belle Plaine Project formalized through a distinct contract between itself and CP, it subsequently <UNDER>requested</UNDER> that its work on the Belle Plaine Project be brought within the existing Hatch Contract. CP's acceptance of the Hatch proposal was expressly subject to Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project being undertaken pursuant to the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibits F, G and H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Hatch carries on business in Alberta, with offices in both Calgary and Edmonton,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 12 to the Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;McArdle Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and conducted the initial design work for the Belle Plaine Project at its office in Calgary, Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This was in keeping with the proposal Hatch provided for the work on the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;), which identified 11 individuals as the personnel who would be working on the design and engineering of the Belle Plaine Project, all but two of whom were in Alberta (with none in Saskatchewan).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, para 6 and Schedule A at pages 20&ndash;32, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The Hatch Contract reflects the express agreement between Hatch and CP as to the law that would govern and the forum in which disputes would be determined, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch dated January 1, 2012 (&ldquo;Hatch Contract&rdquo;), section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The vast majority of the Hatch employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project, including the Project Managers, Directors and Engineers, were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hatch's Project Manager for the Belle Plaine Project was based in Calgary throughout the period while Hatch was performing the work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, including at the time of the Embankment Failure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 5; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. As set out in the Hatch Proposal, although Hatch was to be the &ldquo;prime consultant&rdquo; and would rely on its &ldquo;strong, multi-discipline Calgary-based team&rdquo;, Hatch also proposed retaining its &ldquo;exclusive subconsultants&rdquo;, including Thurber, to assist with work on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit at para 6 and Schedule A at page 33, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its contractual obligations to CP under the Hatch Contract, Hatch was required to ensure that any subcontractors strictly adhered to all of the terms of the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 6 of Schedule A, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Thurber, which is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was retained by Hatch pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd., filed April 5, 2018 at para 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice to Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Thurber Engineering Ltd. are attached as Appendix A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Thurber carries on business in Alberta and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP/Thurber Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Thurber Corporation dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On April 5, 2018, Thurber filed a Statement of Defence and Notices of Claim against Co-Defendants in this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd. and Notice to Co-defendants filed April 5, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Through its Notices to Co-defendants, Thurber is seeking contribution and indemnity from each of the other defendants in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact.</P>
<P>23. Clifton was also involved in providing geotechnical and environmental engineering services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Clifton provided construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Clifton is a federal corporation which maintains its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan and has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 2 and 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Supply of Services Retainer into which CP and Clifton had entered effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Retainer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 6 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Correspondence between CP and Clifton in respect of the Clifton Retainer was exchanged between their respective offices in Calgary and Regina. After having been executed on behalf of Clifton, the Clifton Retainer was executed and accepted by CP in Calgary and returned to Clifton by mail or courier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The Clifton Retainer prescribes the applicable law and jurisdiction:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Later, on April 8, 2015, CP and Clifton entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) under which Clifton was to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11; Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Clifton dated April 8, 2016 (&ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Like the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract reflects the express agreement between CP and Clifton prescribing the law applicable to the Clifton Contract and the forum in which disputes would be adjudicated, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project involved a significant earthworks component, in respect of which CP contracted with KPCL.</P>
<P>31. KPCL provides both construction and earthmoving services and was the main construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 5, 7 and 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's contractual responsibilities pursuant to the contract in place between it and CP included the construction of the Qu-Appelle River crossing and adjacent embankments,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> one of which is the subject matter of this Action.</P>
<P>32. Throughout the course of its work on the Belle Plaine Project and, indeed, until approximately one month after KPCL was served with the Statement of Claim in this Action, KPCL was registered in Alberta as an extra-provincial corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; First Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of KPCL dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 6, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. Altus, which is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta and maintains its head office within Alberta, provided survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project under an agreement between CP and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, paras 3 and 4. A copy of the Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership is attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On April 27, 2018, Altus filed a Statement of Defence to this Action. While Altus has not filed Notices to Co-defendants, in its Statement of Defence, Altus pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c C-27 and the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c T-5.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix B: Statement of Defence on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. Intact is the only defendant to this Action not directly involved in the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project. The Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL required KPCL to provide CP with a performance bond through a duly licensed surety company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL dated March 12, 2015 (&ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;), section GC35, Exhibit 8 to the Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Intact was selected as that company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Intact, a federally regulated company,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carries on business and maintains offices in Alberta and is licensed to provide insurance in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories dated June 12 2018 (&ldquo;Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 1&ndash;3, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. On or about May 28, 2015, Intact issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP for the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Performance Bond issued by Intact to KPCL on May 28, 2015, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Percy Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Despite having guaranteed the performance of KPCL's obligations with respect to the Belle Plaine Project, which included construction of the embankment that failed, Intact has refused to act upon the bond to address KPCL's defaults. Intact's failure to honour its obligations under the performance bond left CP in the position of having to fund all of the work in connection with KPCL's failures, without the benefit of the bond provided.</P>
<P>39. KPCL alleges that proceedings in Alberta will have a detrimental impact on KPCL's finances and its operations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g. Panteluk Affidavit, paras 85 and 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet has remarkably refused to provide any of its financial information,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 28, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to Second Notice to Admit Facts dated June 8, 2018, para 5, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the inference being that the financial information would not support the allegations. In a similar vein, Intact initially provided sworn evidence that this dispute is presently having an impact on the bonding support Intact is able to provide to KPCL,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet both KPCL and Intact have since confirmed that no such impact has been felt.</P>
<P>40. KPCL, for its part, concedes that it has not turned down any jobs, or declined to bid on any jobs, due to unavailability of bonding support or limitations on the scope of bonding available to it, whether through Intact or any other surety provider.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 11, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 5 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, Intact has confirmed that at no time between January 1, 2016 and April 2018 has it refused any request for bonding from KPCL, nor has it reduced the amount of any bond issued to KPCL or otherwise limited the scope of bonding available to KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 4 and 6, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, the allegations of financial impact have no substantiation.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. CP's Statement of Claim was served soon after it was filed, as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was served in Estevan, Saskatchewan on January 10, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) Thurber was served in Victoria, British Columbia on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch was served in Mississauga, Ontario on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Intact was served in Calgary, Alberta on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(e) Altus was served in Edmonton, Alberta on January 11, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Clifton was served in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 19, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>42. On February 6, 2018, almost a full month after service of the Statement of Claim in this Action, counsel for KPCL sought confirmation that an extension would be granted in respect of KPCL's Statement of Defence and that CP would not take any steps against KPCL in the interim. It is surely not a coincidence that until February 6, 2018, KPCL was registered with Alberta Registries as an extra-provincial corporation in the province of Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule A, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, paras 6 and 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Unbeknownst to CP, KPCL had previously filed a Statement of Claim against CP in Regina in Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 2177/2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;). Like the within Action, KPCL's Saskatchewan Action concerns the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>44. Although KPCL's Saskatchewan Action was filed in August 2017, KPCL took no steps to serve the claim at that point, but instead waited more than five months, including almost a full month <UNDER>after</UNDER> CP served the Statement of Claim in this Action upon KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 1, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 5, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Interestingly, it was not until February 7, 2018, after having secured CP's agreement to an extension in respect of its own Statement of Defence, that KPCL served CP with the KPCL Saskatchewan Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule B, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Upon receipt of KPCL's Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, CP immediately advised KPCL that it considered jurisdiction to be an issue in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action. Indeed, KPCL already knew that, as CP had initiated this Action in Alberta. On February 9, 2018, in the interests of efficiency and practicality, CP proposed that the jurisdictional issues in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action be addressed as part of KPCL's planned application in respect of jurisdiction before this Court, obviating the need for a duplicate application before the Saskatchewan Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule C, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and thereby minimizing the cost and time associated with trying to deal with similar motions in separate jurisdictions.</P>
<P>46. KPCL refused. Rather, KPCL insisted that it was unable to consider CP's proposal until CP had filed an application of its own challenging jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, presumably for strategic reasons. KPCL also refused CP's request for an extension of time in respect of CP's Statement of Defence in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule D, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. Indeed, although KPCL filed its application challenging jurisdiction on February 8, 2018, it subsequently took the position that it was unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, Exhibits N-II, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only after forcing a court appearance to address scheduling were the Jurisdiction Applications set down for July 4 and 5, 2018.</P>
<P>48. Despite the existence of not only CP's claim in the within Action, but its own claim in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, both of which raise issues in respect of the obligations between CP and KPCL on the Belle Plaine Project and the performance of those obligations, on March 5, 2018 KPCL filed yet another claim against CP by way of Originating Application under Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 655/2018, seeking payment of holdback funds relating to the Belle Plaine Project (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 16 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. CP sought a stay of the need to challenge jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and KPCL's Originating Application (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Actions</BOLD>&rdquo;), pending the determination of the Jurisdiction Applications. CP's application was heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow in Regina on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit, paras 4 - 5 .</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Justice Chow was advised of KPCL's pending jurisdictional challenge before the Alberta Courts. CP argued that the need to bring an application in Saskatchewan to challenge jurisdiction was contrary to the foundational Rules in Saskatchewan and Alberta of trying to address matters in an efficient and cost effective manner, when the precise issue was to be determined in Alberta on July 4 and 5. KPCL, through its opposition to that and in filing further claims in Saskatchewan, seems opposed to the suggestion of efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>50. CP has not yet filed an application challenging jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and, accordingly, such applications&mdash;should they become necessary&mdash;have not yet been set down, let alone heard. It follows that neither of the Saskatchewan Actions have yet been set down for hearing.</P>
<P>51. On December 1, 2017, CP also filed a claim as against Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;) in QB Action No. 1701-16251 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh Action</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A copy of the Statement of Claim filed on behalf of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in QB Action No. 1701-16251 is attached as Appendix C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Marsh Action also concerns the Belle Plaine Project, but is specific to CP's allegations that breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of Marsh, which provided insurance brokerage services to CP, including in respect of insurance on the Belle Plaine Project, have resulted in damages to CP.</P>
<P>52. Marsh has undertaken to defend in the March Action and will not be challenging jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. DISCUSSION</TI>
<P>53. The analysis of the jurisdictional questions raised in respect of this Action has two distinct parts: the first addresses the jurisdiction of the Court <EM>simpliciter</EM>, while the second concerns the issue of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Haaretz</EM></BOLD>], para 27, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>101&ndash;105</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Van Breda</EM></BOLD>] <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. Jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is based upon the existence of a real and substantial connection between the forum and the subject matter of an action, as demonstrated by the presence of one or more presumptive connecting factors. To rebut a presumed real and substantial connection, the party challenging jurisdiction must establish that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the claim is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction.&rdquo; The factors upon which the party seeking to rebut a presumed real and substantial connection should not be those considered during the second stage of the analysis, as the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is, and must remain, distinct.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 43, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 56, 81, 92 and 97</P1></P>
<P>55. Once jurisdiction is established through the real and substantial connection test, the claim will proceed in that jurisdiction unless a party challenging jurisdiction is able to show that exceptional circumstances exist such that another jurisdiction is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; The bar is high&mdash;the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that:
<QUOTE><P>The use of the words &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo; should be interpreted as an acknowledgment that the normal state of affairs is that jurisdiction should be exercised once it is properly assumed. ... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 46, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 109</P1></P>
<P>56. Assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is multi-factorial and requires a Court to consider the overall fairness and efficiency of proceeding in one jurisdiction as opposed to another, as determined based on factors ranging from the law applicable to the dispute to the location of physical evidence to the comparative convenience and expense for the parties and likely witnesses.</P>
<P>57. In this instance, the presumptive connecting factors between this claim and Alberta ground the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> of the Alberta courts and there is no sound basis upon which the applying defendants may rebut this presumption.</P>
<P>58. Further, the applying defendants have failed to show that this matter invokes the exceptional circumstances that justify a determination that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum in which to have this Action heard.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> by Consent</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. In this instance, four of the six defendants (Thurber, Altus, Clifton and Hatch) have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. That fact, in itself, is sufficient to resolve the question of whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, to the extent that any such question truly arose. The real and substantial connection is between the forum and the subject of the action, not a particular or specific party.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Governing Principles</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. Parties are always at liberty to consent to a Court's jurisdiction. As confirmed by this Honourable Court, consent:
<QUOTE><P>permits jurisdiction over an extra-provincial defendant who consents, whether by voluntary submission, <UNDER><EM>attornment by appearance and defence</EM>, or prior agreement</UNDER> to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the domestic court.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Limited v Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 ABQB 442</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Norex</EM></BOLD>], para 49, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt et al v Carcelles et al</SOC><CITE>2002 OJ No 2128</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 19 [italicized emphasis in original, underline emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. If a party attorns, or consents contractually or otherwise to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the matter.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc v Research In Motion Ltd</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Meta4Hand</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. Participation in the litigation process also constitutes attornment, and it is well established that when a party defends a lawsuit on the merits, it has implicitly submitted or attorned to the jurisdiction of the court in which the action was brought.
<P1><EM>Norex</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bansal v Ferrara Pan Candy Co</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 384</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. It is also open to parties to enter into commercial agreements regarding the forum in which disputes between them are to be adjudicated, and it is &ldquo;essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding contracting parties to [such] agreements.&rdquo; Where there is a valid agreement that includes an agreement as to jurisdiction, consideration of whether there is a real and substantial connection to the forum is redundant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>ZI Pompey</EM></BOLD>], paras 20 and 21, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD></P1>
<P1>Castel and Walker, <EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, 6<SUP>th</SUP> ed., (LexisNexis: Toronto, 2005) at 11-8, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Goldmart Farms Inc v Fasig-Tipton Co</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 1631</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 7</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. Forum selection clauses are a distinct element in consideration of jurisdiction, and should not be subsumed within the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. Further, forum selection clauses should be enforced unless there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to do so. In this respect, the burden is on the party challenging jurisdiction to &ldquo;show sufficiently strong reasons to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just in the circumstances to require the [challenging party] to adhere to the terms of the clause.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>ZI Pompey</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 20, 21 and 39</P1></P>
<P>65. Inconvenience does not amount to strong cause. It is, for example, not open to parties who have entered into a contractual agreement with respect to forum to complain later that the evidence and witnesses may not be within that jurisdiction. Such facts either were or ought to have been known prior to entering into the agreement containing the forum selection provision and, to the extent that posed a concern, the appropriate time to raise the issue is at the time of contract negotiation. Allowing the location of witnesses and evidence to be raised after the fact would undermine commercially negotiated agreements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Atlantic Cement Carriers Ltd v Atlantic Towing Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 761</CITE><PARANUM>21 and 24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. In terms of their substance, forum selection clauses fall along a spectrum, from contracts which contain no such provisions to those which contain exclusive jurisdiction provisions under which the parties choose a single forum for the adjudication of disputes.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v Megawheels Technologies Inc</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 4493</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Megawheels</EM></BOLD>], para 19, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. While even an exclusive attornment provision does not oust the jurisdiction of a local court, courts give significant weight to exclusive attornment provisions and should not interfere with the parties' selection of forum attornment provisions &ldquo;unless it is shown that the matter cannot be properly dealt with in the foreign court.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 20</P1></P>
<P>68. Non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions also carry significant weight. In <CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp. v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Virtue described such clauses as &ldquo;important consideration[s]&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; in the context of a forum selection clause means that the parties have attorned to that jurisdiction &ldquo;except in matters where some extraordinary condition or reason would require that the matter be determined elsewhere.&rdquo; Once a suit arises in the selected jurisdiction, the parties will be required to attorn.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>136 AR 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 28, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 10</BOLD></P1>

<P>69. Unsurprisingly, the operation of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is more limited in scope than that of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Essentially, under a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, &ldquo;either party may sue the other wherever it has the right to do so&rdquo;, but once one party initiates a suit in the named jurisdiction, the other party must keep its bargain by attorning to that jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 28</P1></P>
<P>70. While a forum selection clause must be applicable to the dispute in question in order to be given effect, it is inappropriate to parse the wordings of forum selection clauses too closely to determine whether they apply to the claims as pleaded, as this can foster &ldquo;dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution.&rdquo; Courts interpret jurisdiction clauses broadly, and have rejected an approach in which fine distinctions are drawn based upon the language used.
<P1>Rafferty and Pitel, <EM>Conflict of Laws</EM>, 2nd ed (Irwin law: Toronto, 2010) at 131-132, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 12</BOLD></P1>

<P>71. Where a claim of negligence has arisen in a contractual relationship based upon an agreement which contains a forum selection clause, the forum selection is equally applicable to a claim in tort unless the clause clearly does <UNDER>not</UNDER> cover the dispute.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12-11-13</P1></P>
<P>72. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered a claim in which the plaintiff had entered into two contracts with the defendants, one of which contained a forum selection clause through which the parties agreed that &ldquo;any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this Agreement&rdquo; was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and the other of which contained no forum selection clause. The plaintiff sued in Ontario for negligent misrepresentation based upon the second contract. The defendants successfully sought a stay based upon the forum selection provision in the other contract, with the Court concluding that the claims in negligence were intertwined with the contract, making it inevitable that the contract would be before the court as part of the factual narrative and through the reliance of the defendants upon the contract in their defences, such that there was no basis not to enforce the forum selection provision.

<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>73. Thurber and Altus, having filed Statements of Defence that address the substance of the claims against them, have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. The claims against them arising from the Belle Plains Project will proceed in Alberta. As well, the notices for contribution and indemnity will also, presumably, proceed.</P>
<P>74. Hatch and Clifton have also attorned, through their respective contracts with CP, to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts in respect of this Action.</P>
<P>75. The validity of the Clifton Retainer, Clifton Contract and Hatch Contract is unchallenged, and there is no suggestion that this matter cannot properly be dealt with by the Alberta Courts.</P>
<P>76. Clifton and CP attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract. Under the Clifton Retainer, CP and Clifton &ldquo;attorn[ed] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Contract, for its part, stipulates that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reflecting Clifton's attornment to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>77. Both Hatch and CP attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts through the Hatch Contract, which states that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The attornment provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract contain no limitation as to subject matter scope. Certainly, they contain nothing that would suggest that they &ldquo;clearly [do] not&rdquo; cover claims in either breach of contract or tort, and it would be absurd to suggest that these provisions do not apply to breaches of the very contracts in which they appear.</P>
<P>79. This is consistent with the wording of the attornment provisions. In each of these Contracts, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is a long and detailed contract, expressly including not just the portion containing the terms in which the forum selection provisions are set out, but associated schedules providing descriptions of services, minimum requirements for personnel, security requirements, and other details regarding the work to be performed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, page 1, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit; Clifton Retainer, page 1, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, page 1, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More importantly, through the Hatch Contract, the Clifton Contract and the Clifton Retainer, Clifton and Hatch expressly agreed to provide services, meaning their engineering and design work in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; bringing not only contractual interpretation but the performance of the contract squarely within <UNDER>all</UNDER> of the terms of the Agreements, including the forum selection provision.</P>
<P>80. The proper interpretation of a forum selection clause was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the contractual duty of good faith, and alternatively for breach of agency duty and wrongful dismissal. The defendant applied for a stay of the action in British Columbia based upon the forum selection provision in the contract between the parties, which read:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Saskatchewan in respect of its interpretation or breach.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1700</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>81. The claim launched was almost wholly unrelated to either the interpretation or breach of the contract that contained the jurisdiction clause, with the Court noting that it was not a case in which the parties &ldquo;had a difference of opinion over the interpretation of the contract or alleged the other to be in breach of it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 53</P1></P>
<P>82. That is in sharp contrast to the present situation.</P>
<P>83. Here, there is no limitation upon the scope of the attornment provisions. Clifton and Hatch suggest that the absence of a limitation somehow indicates that the provisions are limited to interpretation. This, with respect, is a transparent effort to create ambiguity where none exists and should not be permitted.</P>
<P>84. CP, Clifton and Hatch have attorned (either exclusively or nonexclusively) to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;full stop. That attornment is, as suggested by the whole of each provision, in respect of the &ldquo;Agreements.&rdquo; CP's claims against both Hatch and Clifton expressly allege that those defendants are in breach of their respective Agreements with CP, bringing the claims directly within the scope of the forum selection provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Contract and Clifton Retainer.</P>
<P>85. The Clifton Contract contains an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, as there is no suggestion that this claim cannot be properly dealt with by the Alberta Courts, there is no reason to interfere with this contractual provision.</P>
<P>86. The Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer contain non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions. Given that CP has filed the Statement of Claim in the within Action in Alberta&mdash;the selected forum&mdash;both Clifton and Hatch are contractually bound to the jurisdiction.</P>
<P>87. To the extent that this Honourable Court finds that the wording of the forum selection provision in the Clifton Contract allowed CP to begin proceedings in other jurisdiction affects the exclusivity of the provision in respect of Clifton (rather than CP alone, per the wording of the clause), the only result would be to transform the provision into one in which both parties had attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The provision would then operate in the same way as the provisions within the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer, meaning that Clifton would be required to attorn to CP's Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>88. In addition to the breach of contract claims set out in CP's Statement of Claim, claims of negligence have arisen within CP's contractual relationships with both Hatch and Clifton. CP's claims in contract and tort are intertwined, making this a situation in which the contractual attornment provisions are applicable to both.</P>
<P>89. For the foregoing reasons, the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> based upon the consent of Thurber, Altus, Hatch and Clifton. There is no reason, let alone strong cause, to oust this jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Via Real and Substantial Connection</UNDER></TI>
<P>90. A court has jurisdiction over an action if there is a real and substantial connection between the action and the court's territory. The assumption of jurisdiction is justified under the real and substantial connection test where objective factors, as identified by the courts, connect the plaintiff's claim to the chosen forum. It is not necessary to show the <UNDER>most</UNDER> real and substantial connection, only that such a connection exists.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 4</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 15</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ayles v Arsenault</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 493</CITE><PARANUM>21, 23 and 27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Ayles</EM></BOLD>] citing <CASEREF><SOC>Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye</SOC><CITE>[1990] 3 SCR 1077</CITE><PARANUM>43-44</PARANUM></CASEREF> amongst others, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>91. Further, a real and substantial connection between one alleged cause of action and the jurisdiction is sufficient to ground a Court's jurisdiction over the whole. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, Justice LeBel was explicit on this point, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>it is possible for a case to sound both in contract and in tort or to invoke more than one tort. Would a court be limited to hearing the specific part of the case that can be directly connected with the jurisdiction? Such a rule would breach the principles of fairness and efficiency on which the assumption of jurisdiction is based. The purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation and the defendant. If such a connection exists in respect of a factual and legal situation, the court must assume jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. The plaintiff should not be obliged to litigate a tort claim in Manitoba and a related claim for restitution in Nova Scotia. That would be incompatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 99</P1></P>
<P>92. The following factors were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 90</P1></P>
<P>93. Where one of the factors giving rise to a real and substantial connection is present, the defendant bears the burden of rebutting the presumed connection. Rebutting the presumption, however, requires the party challenging jurisdiction to show that the connection is so weak that it would not be reasonable for that party to expect to be called to answer proceedings in the forum with which the real and substantial connection exists.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 95 and 97</P1>
<P1><EM>Ayles</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 27</P1></P>
<P>94. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada also recognized that, where there is a real and substantial connection for the purpose of satisfying the applicable rule for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection may be presumed to exist. While procedural directives such as the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> do not <UNDER>establish</UNDER> jurisdiction, they &ldquo;represent an expression of wisdom and experience drawn from the life of the law&rdquo; and &ldquo;are based on objective facts that may also indicate when courts can properly assume jurisdiction.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 43 and 83</P1></P>
<P>95. In Alberta, the factors to be considered in assessing whether service <EM>ex juris</EM> is appropriate are set out in Rule 11.25(3), which states in part that:
<QUOTE><P>... in the following circumstances a real and substantial connection is presumed to exist: ...</P>
<P>(b) the claim relates to a contract or alleged contract made, performed or breached in Alberta;</P>
<P>(c) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta;...</P>
<P>(d) the claim relates to a tort committed in Alberta;...</P>
<P>(g) the defendant is resident in Alberta; ...</P>
<P>(i) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta Reg 124/2010, rule 11.25(3) [<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>96. The analysis of jurisdiction simpliciter set out in <EM>Van Breda</EM> and the procedural rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM> are to be integrated in reaching a decision as to jurisdiction. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court concluded that for the purpose of service, the &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; connecting factor is a presumptive connecting factor where the subject matter of the action is connected to Alberta and the other principal players in the dispute are Alberta corporations. This only makes sense, otherwise different claims, involving different parties would need to be litigated in different jurisdictions even though they arise from a common set of facts. That could not, to use Justice Lebel's words, be compatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Arcis</BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>97. In <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc. v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Farrington relied upon <EM>Arcis</EM> as a post-<EM>Van Breda</EM> case that specifically retains &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; as a presumptive connecting factor, grounding a finding that the Court had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in part on the necessary and proper party connection.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 402</CITE><PARANUM>26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Jebco</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>98. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility</SOC></CASEREF> this Court affirmed that the factors set out in Rule 11. 25(3), including whether a defendant is a proper and necessary party, constitute presumptive real and substantial connections for the purpose of a jurisdictional analysis.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 36</CITE><PARANUM>54 and 59</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>99. Accordingly, factors establishing a presumptive real and substantial connection include:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) a contract connected with the dispute was made, performed or breached in the province;</P>
<P>(d) the tort was committed in the province;</P>
<P>(e) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta; and</P>
<P>(f) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>100. In addition, while the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not a <EM>prima facie</EM> connecting factor, in <EM>Van Breda</EM> the Court suggested that the plaintiff's location is nonetheless relevant, stating that the:
<QUOTE><P>... presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not, <UNDER>on its own</UNDER>, a sufficient connecting factor. ... <UNDER>Absent other considerations,</UNDER> the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction will not create a presumptive relationship between the forum and either the subject matter of the litigation or the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 86 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>101. In this case, while CP's presence in Alberta does not, on its own, establish the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, the fact that CP is resident and carries on business in Alberta is a further factor in favour of maintaining Alberta jurisdiction.</P>

<P>110. The Thurber Contract was made in Alberta and is connected to the subject matter of this dispute&mdash;this amounts to another presumptive real and substantial connection with Alberta.</P>
<P>111. Performance of a contract in Alberta is, equally, a presumptive real and substantial connection factor. Performance of a contract involves the fulfillment of an obligation or a promise under that contract.
<P1><EM>Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary</EM>, 7th ed., <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>112. In this case, both Hatch and Thurber had contractual obligations to perform engineering and geotechnical work on behalf of CP as part of the Belle Plaine Project. That work was carried out in Alberta.</P>
<P>113. Hatch employees involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the initial design work performed by Hatch was done within its office in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>115. The work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, which was the driving purpose underlying the Hatch Contract, was performed in Alberta. Likewise, Thurber's work under the Thurber Contract, through which it provided engineering and geotechnical work for the Belle Plaine Project, occurred within Alberta. The performance of these contracts in Alberta constitutes a further real and substantial connection between Alberta and this Action.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>117. The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs where the representation is received or acted upon. It is, moreover, foreseeable that misrepresentations sent to a plaintiff's office in one jurisdiction would be received and relied upon by the plaintiff in another province. If the defendant foresees that its representations will be received or acted upon within a particular jurisdiction, it should expect to be called to account in proceedings in that jurisdiction. As explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal, &ldquo;[i]n the modem world where corporations have various offices in various locations, corporate defendants should not escape liability simply because they send studies [the studies being the source of the alleged misrepresentation] to an office of the plaintiff outside Ontario with the clear understanding that it will be acted on in Ontario.&rdquo;

<P>124. Altus is an Alberta corporation and was served in Alberta. The only question under this factor in the analysis is whether the other defendants, had they been in Alberta, would have been proper parties to the claim.</P>
<P>125. The answer to this question in respect of each of the other defendants is resoundingly yes.</P>
<P>126.

<P>127. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is distinct from, and irrelevant to, the question of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 27-28</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 101</P1></P>
<P>128. Where a Court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a real and substantial connection, it retains a residual discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that it is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and that another forum is preferable. The onus is on the party seeking a stay on this basis to show that an alternate forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, based not upon the preferences of the parties as KPCL suggests,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 133&ndash;136.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but upon the requirements of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 105 and 108</P1></P>
<P>129. A proper <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis does not dissect the claims in an effort to separate constituent causes of action or claims against individual parties that might, in the absence of the larger proceeding, be outside the jurisdiction of the court in which an action has been filed. Rather, where multiple claims are brought within one proceeding, the action is to be considered as a whole to assess whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, supra at 13&ndash;23</P1></P>
<P>130. As with jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing a challenge to jurisdiction based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court identified the following as potentially relevant, depending on the context:
<P1>(a) the locations of parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 110</P1></P>
<P>131. The factors identified in the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's <EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> are also relevant to assessing forum <EM>non conveniens</EM>, even where, as here, the forum challenged has not adopted that type of legislation.
<P1><EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> [<BOLD><EM>CJPTA</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 26</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breeden v Black</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 19</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Breeden</EM></BOLD>], para 23, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 27</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>132. Accordingly, the following <EM>CJPTA</EM> factors are also relevant when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum;</P1>
<P1>(b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding;</P1>
<P1>(c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts;</P1>
<P1>(e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole.</P1>
<P1><EM>Breeden</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 23, citing section 11(2) of the <EM>CJPTA</EM></P1></P>
<P>133. In cases involving more than one potentially appropriate forum, there is a presumption in favour of the forum selected by the plaintiff, which &ldquo;wins by default if there is no clearly preferable alternative.&rdquo;

<P>135. As this shows, of 48 likely witnesses CP has identified to date, 18 (or 33%) are in Saskatchewan, 16 are in Alberta, and the remainder are either outside both jurisdictions or in unknown locations.</P>
<P>136. Regardless of the jurisdiction in which this Action is heard, it will undoubtedly be inconvenient for witnesses to travel from one jurisdiction to another for questioning and, eventually, trial. Moreover, there will be expenses associated with that process. CP is certainly prepared to assist in minimizing both the cost and inconvenience by attending upon witnesses in their own jurisdictions for questioning, as may be reasonable.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>137. The parties to this claim are located in Alberta (CP and Altus), Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton), British Columbia (Thurber) and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact has, for the purpose of this application, filed an Affidavit from an individual in Alberta, but is a federally regulated corporation. See Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>138. It would be inconvenient for Clifton and KPCL to have this claim proceed in Alberta, and it would be equally inconvenient for CP and Altus to litigate in Saskatchewan, rendering this a neutral factor.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Records</UNDER></TI>
<P>139. In terms of the available evidence, it is only to be expected that many of the records regarding the Belle Plaine Project will be electronically accessible from virtually any jurisdiction, including Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 30, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 5-6, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>140. That said, physical records also exist regarding the parties work on the Belle Plaine Project. While some of the defendants have their physical records for the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan, Hatch, which provided the primary engineering services for the design of the Belle Plaine Project, has physical records mostly located in Alberta, with <UNDER>none</UNDER> in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 3&mdash;4, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>141. Regardless of where this Action proceeds, witnesses and parties will be inconvenienced. Expenses will be incurred. There is no basis upon which to assume that travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta is more expensive or inconvenient than travel in the other direction, and the parties, witnesses and records are balanced as between Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Cost of Transfer</UNDER></TI>
<P>142. At this stage, there would be little cost associated with a transfer of either the Saskatchewan Actions to Alberta or with transferring this Action to Saskatchewan, recognizing that two defendants have already defended the Alberta action and they may have issues with being somehow forced into Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(e)</N><TI>Comparative Convenience/Expense</TI>
<P>143. However, the comparative convenience of proceeding in Alberta as opposed to Saskatchewan cannot be considered without reference to the forum selection clauses that apply to Hatch and Clifton, as outlined above. As explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd. v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>it must be the rare case where [balance of convenience and expense] alone is so overwhelming as to be determinative if all other considerations are largely neutral or would dictate that the parties' agreement be upheld. That must be particularly so when, as here, the choice is between two common law jurisdictions in this country. A party who resides or carries on business in British Columbia but who agrees to litigate disputes in the courts of another province must be taken to have accepted at the time the agreement was made that there could be a significant measure of inconvenience and expense associated with geographical distances. That party should not then, without more, be easily relieved of the contractual obligation it agreed to bear.</P></QUOTE>

<P>144. If only the locations of the likely witnesses, the parties and the records regarding this claim were taken into account, the assessment of comparative convenience weighs slightly in favour of Alberta. However, once the jurisdiction clauses are also considered, as they must be, it is clear that neither Hatch nor Clifton ought to be relieved of any additional inconvenience or expense associated with the contractual agreements they accepted. As a result, on the whole, this factor weighs strongly in favour of Alberta's jurisdiction over this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Law to be Applied</UNDER></TI>
<P>145. The law to be applied to the claims in breach of contract as against Hatch and Clifton is unquestionably the law of Alberta, which is also applicable to the claim of negligent misrepresentation against Clifton and claims in relation to the Thurber Contract. There is, moreover, no reason that if an Alberta court was required to apply Saskatchewan law it could not do so, even in respect of claims requiring interpretation of Saskatchewan legislation such as <EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, which CP says has no application in any event in the within matters.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kerr Interior Systems Ltd v Kenroc Building and Materials Co Ltd</SOC><CITE>2009 ABCA 240</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 30</BOLD></P1>

<P>146. While the law of Saskatchewan may apply to some of CP's claims in tort depending on how the Court construes the place where the tort occurred, and potentially to CP's claims in contract as against KPCL and Intact, Alberta courts could apply that law without issue, which would be no different than the Saskatchewan courts being called upon to apply Alberta law in accordance with the choice of law provisions if this Action were to be transferred to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>147. In either event, the general law of contract and tort are essentially the same in both places, rendering this a neutral factor.

<BLOCK4><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>148. This factor is neutral, as a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts would be recognized in the other jurisdiction. Enforcement will be facilitated by the <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c R-6 and <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSS 1978, c R-3.

<BLOCK4><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Avoiding Multiplicity of Legal Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>149. Rule 1.2(2) of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> highlights the importance of efficiency in Court proceedings, a goal that is even more important in view of the scarcity of judicial resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Generally, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is more efficient in terms of the proceedings themselves and in the use of judicial resources.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 1.2(2)</P1></P>
<P>150. In this case, KPCL itself has, it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions by filing the Originating Application in the face of its own Saskatchewan Action, seeking through both claims further payments in respect of KPCL's work on the Belle Plaine Project and corresponding determinations of KPCL's alleged rights under the KPCL Contract, all of which are raised squarely in this Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>151. It is questionable whether KPCL's second action was commenced genuinely or reflects an effort to bootstrap the current jurisdiction motion. KPCL, if it was looking for efficiency or cost-effectiveness or to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, could equally have simply added its claim in respect of holdback funds under the KPCL Contract to the KPCL Saskatchewan Action or, of course, to the present claim.</P>
<P>152. In addition to <UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity, the substance of the KPCL Originating Application is also questionable. No lien can arise in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, which constitutes a federal undertaking.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Co v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 35</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>153. In the absence of a lien, KPCL is not a &ldquo;lien claimant&rdquo;, as defined within the Builders' Lien Act, and so is not entitled to the remedies available to lien claimants thereunder. Moreover, it is not a trustee or the beneficiary of a trust within the meaning of the Builders' Lien Act. As a result, the remedies KPCL seeks in the KPCL Originating Application are simply unavailable to it, which again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action for such in Saskatchewan, given its jurisdictional challenge was, in February of this year, set for hearing in early July.
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at ss 6(2), 17(1)(a), 38(6) and (7)</P1></P>
<P>154. In addition to having launched multiple actions regarding essentially the same subject matter, which in the usual course would amount to an abuse of process, KPCL has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications in different provinces, with its principal noting that he &ldquo;would like the Saskatchewan court to have the opportunity to address whether it will exercise jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, para 35, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> despite the fact that KPCL is in the process of having this Honourable Court consider the very same question.</P>
<P>155. Multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided. That is axiomatic. This basic principle, which reflects the inherent interest in efficiency, is embedded not only in the <EM>Rules</EM> but also in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2 (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). As confirmed in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, as a corollary to the principle that multiple proceedings regarding the same issues should be avoided, another of the Court's objectives is to ensure that all issues in controversy between the parties are determined as completely and finally as possible. This is the case in every province.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, ss 5(3)(f) and 8, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 36</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>156. In these circumstances, the twin objectives of avoiding multiple proceedings and allowing all issues to be determined as completely and finally as possible militates in favour of allowing this Action to proceed in Alberta, where all of the likely parties to the claim are already parties to the Action, four of the defendants have consented to the Court's jurisdiction, and the remaining two are not only defendants to CP's Statement of Claim but also respondents to a Notice to Co-defendants.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Efficiency</UNDER></TI>
<P>157. CP wasted no time in proceeding with its claim in Alberta. KPCL, in contrast, waited 5 months to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, to which it now points as a parallel proceeding warranting transfer of the within Action to Saskatchewan, until CP's Action had been filed and served, and even then served the KPCL Saskatchewan Action only two days before KPCL's defence was due in this Action. KPCL then served a further proceeding against CP by way of Originating Application, which overlaps significantly with the issues in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and this claim.</P>
<P>158. This Action has, from the outset, included Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact as Defendants. KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, is against only CP. To bring this Action within the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, CP would have to initiate a Counterclaim against KPCL and claim against Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, Altus and Intact as parties, but this is already underway in this Action.</P>
<P>159. Then, of course, the question will arise about the propriety of dragging Altus and Thurber to Saskatchewan, when they have defended in Alberta. On the other hand, if the Action proceeds in Alberta, the issues will all be addressed, against all relevant parties, in one Action</P>
<P>160. Allowing this Action to proceed will also allow determination of the issues in the Saskatchewan Actions, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplicative proceedings. The issues are, in substance, the same, as they relate to issues arising from the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. KPCL should not be rewarded for having waited to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action or for filing a further duplicative claim by being allowed to rely on the Saskatchewan Actions as reason to transfer this Action out of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>161. While CP recognizes that juridical advantage is of less weight in assessing jurisdiction as between provinces than in an international context, in this instance proceedings in Alberta, CP's chosen forum, offer two juridical benefits. There is no basis upon which to deprive CP of either.</P>
<P>162. One is a benefit to all parties in the context of this litigation. Under the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, there is no formal limit to the number of corporate witnesses who may be questioned. In contrast, under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, parties are entitled to question only one representative of a corporation in the absence of a Court Order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., filed March 29, 2018, para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While CP expects that this would be addressed by agreement amongst counsel, given the complex and highly technical nature of the subject matter of this claim, it is important to ensure that fulsome questioning is available.</P>
<P>163. Further, if this Action is stayed or set aside, the defendants may attempt to argue that CP is barred from proceeding with an action in Saskatchewan by virtue of <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, which may be the actual motivation behind KPCL's multiplicity of actions and applications. In contrast, there is no question that CP's Statement of Claim in this Action was filed and served within the appropriate time. It would, to put it mildly, be a significant loss of the juridical advantage of proceeding in Alberta if CP were to find itself time barred in an alternate forum.</P>
<P>164. If this Court determines that CP's choice of forum and the submission to jurisdiction of Thurber and Altus should be disregarded, and concludes that the jurisdictional provisions in the contracts between CP and Hatch and CP and Clifton need not be honoured, any resulting transfer of this Action should be undertaken pursuant to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Attornment to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>165. Taking steps to contest the substantive merits of a claim is the principal hallmark of attornment. Filing an application to object to the jurisdiction of the forum is not attornment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Manson v Canada (Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 212</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 37</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>166. The suggestion that this Action be stayed or set aside in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan appears to ignore the fact that a portion of CP's claim will remain within the jurisdiction. CP's Statement of Claim against Thurber and Altus is separate and apart from the Jurisdiction Applications. These claims, as well as any claims arising under the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, will need to be addressed in any event.</P>
<P>167. CP intentionally has not, to this point, taken any steps to contest the merits of either of the Saskatchewan Actions. Rather, CP has sought only to address initial matters preliminary to potential applications in respect of jurisdiction. This does not constitute attornment.</P>
<P>168. In <CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC></CASEREF>, the defendant brought a motion to stay the Plaintiff's action in Ontario, and submitted that Quebec was the more appropriate forum for the action. The plaintiff filed his action in Ontario, then the defendant brought a parallel action in Quebec. After both actions had commenced, the plaintiff brought a motion for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief. That relief was granted. In the course of granting a stay of the Ontario action, the Court explained that:
<QUOTE><P>the defendant has not attorned to the Ontario Court's jurisdiction but <UNDER>was required to respond to the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief</UNDER> because the plaintiff refused the defendant's request for an adjournment of the plaintiff's motion and to permit her first to bring a motion to contest the forum. As such, <UNDER>the defendant came before [the justice hearing the injunction motion] under duress</UNDER>, after clearly signalling her intention to contest jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>169. Similarly, in this case CP was required to respond to KPCL's Originating Application, as KPCL had amply demonstrated its unwillingness to adjourn pending the hearing of its existing Jurisdiction Application. CP has, from its first interactions with KPCL, signalled its intention to contest jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and has taken no steps to contest the merits of either matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><TI>Remedy claimed or sought:</TI>
<P>1. An Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CPR&rdquo;), as against the Defendant, Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;), for want of jurisdiction;</P>
<P>2. Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in relation to the whole of the action, and an Order staying this action in its entirety against Intact;</P>
<P>3. Costs of this Application; and</P>
<P>4. Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Grounds for making this application:</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Overview</EM></TI>
<P>5. Intact supports the applications of its Co-Defendants, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;) filed February 8, 2018, and Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;) filed February 23, 2018, to set aside the Statement of Claim for want of jurisdiction or stay this Action on the basis that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and repeats and relies on the applicable grounds raised by the Co-Defendants in making this Application.</P>
<P>6. Intact takes the position that the Alberta Court does not have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over it as there is no &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo; connection between Alberta and the facts on which the claims made in this action are based, particularly CPR's claims against Intact.</P>
<P>7. Further, or in the alternative, if Alberta has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the action or Intact, which is denied, Alberta is not an appropriate or convenient, or the clearly most appropriate or convenient, forum to adjudicate the whole of this action. Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P>
<P>8. Saskatchewan is the most appropriate or convenient, or the clearly most appropriate or convenient, forum for the adjudication of the disputes raised in or related to the matters raised in this action. Saskatchewan is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Background</EM></TI>
<P>9. On December 1, 2017, CPR filed a Statement of Claim for damages allegedly arising out of work performed by KPCL and others for the construction of a new, 30.4-km railway spur, known as the Belle Plaine Railway Spur, located between Belle Plaine and Findlater, in the Province of Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;).</P>
<P>10. Intact issued a Performance Bond and a Labour and Material Payment Bond, under no. XXXXXXXXXX each in the amount of $45,870,133.00, at the request of KPCL in relation to the Project (collectively, the &ldquo;Bonds&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. The Bonds were executed by Maureen Matheson, Attorney-in-fact on behalf of Intact, in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>12. The Project was performed entirely in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>13. The subject matter of this action relates to an alleged construction failure at the Project that occurred in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>14. KPCL has an existing action against CPR in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (filed August 28, 2017 in the Regina Judicial Centre, file no. QBG2177/17) for alleged damages relating to the Project, in which it is anticipated that Intact will be involved. If the within action is not stayed in Alberta, there would be a multiplicity of proceedings in different jurisdictions, and to its prejudice, Intact would be exposed to significant costs and inconvenience.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Analysis</EM></TI>
<P>15. The Bonds contemplated that the applicable legislation and jurisdiction of the Courts would be the laws and jurisdiction of the place in which the work for the Project was being performed.</P>
<P>16. The limitation period for the commencement of any suit or action under the Performance Bond is:
<QUOTE><P>before the expiration of two (2) years from the earlier of 1) the date of Substantial Performance of the Contract as defined in the lien legislation where the work under the Contract is taking place, or, if no such definition exists, the date when the work is ready for use or is being used for the purpose intended, or 2) the date on which the Principal is declared in default by the Obligee,</P></QUOTE>
and the implication is that the law of the place in which the Contract is being performed will be the law applicable to any claim that is advanced under the Performance Bond. In this case all of the work on the Project was performed in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>17. The Labour and Material Bond provides that:
<P1>(a) written notice must be provided to each of the Principal, the Surety and the Obligee, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed, and that a suit or action was brought in accordance with the Bond;</P1>
<P1>(b) the notice shall be served by registered mail &ldquo;at any place where an office is regularly maintained for the transaction of business by such persons or served in any manner in which legal process may be served in the Province or Territory in which the subject matter of the Contract is located&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) that notice of any claim for holdback arising &ldquo;under either the terms of the Claimant's contract with the Principal, or under the lien Legislation applicable to the Claimant's contract with the Principal&rdquo; shall be served within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such Claimant should have been paid under its contract; and</P1>
<P1>(d) precludes any claim being advanced &ldquo;other than in a Court of competent jurisdiction in the Province or Territory in which the work described in the Contract is to be installed or delivered as the case may be and not elsewhere, and the parties hereto agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such Court.</P1></P>
<P>18. Read as a whole, the Bonds contemplate that any claims under the Bonds are to be determined in accordance with the laws of the place in which the work under the Contract is performed and that the Courts of the place where the Contract is being performed will have exclusive jurisdiction to determine such claims.</P>
<P>19. The work performed under the Bonded Contract was entirely performed in Saskatchewan, and litigation involving KPCL and CPR already exists in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in relation to the Project.</P>
<P>20. It is anticipated, and expected that the other parties to this action may become involved in the Saskatchewan litigation and/or other possible litigation in relation to the Project between other parties to this action.</P>
<P>21. The majority of the potential fact witnesses reside in Saskatchewan, with only a few of the potential witnesses residing in Alberta. Similarly, most of the potential evidence is located in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>22. With a multiplicity of actions in different provinces, there is a risk of conflicting judgments.</P>
<P>23. It is fair, just, efficient and convenient for this action to be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan should CPR make an application to transfer these proceedings.</P>
<P>24. Intact may be exposed to a multiplicity of actions if the action is not stayed in Alberta, and CPR will suffer no such prejudice or harm if it is transferred by CPR to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>25. Trial time may be available earlier in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>26. Intact has not filed a Statement of Defence in this action.</P>
<P>27. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Material or evidence to be relied on:</TI>
<P>28. The Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk, filed February 8, 2018; and</P>
<P>29. The Affidavit of Trent Percy, filed March 23 2018.</P></BLOCK3>

<BLOCK3><TI>Applicable Acts and regulations:</TI>
<P>31. None.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Any irregularity complained of or objection relied on:</TI>
<P>32. This Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over CPR's claims against Intact. Intact brings this application expressly without attorning to the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.</P>
<P>33. Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> with respect to the within action.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>How the application is proposed to be heard or considered:</TI>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF TRENT PERCY <EM>Sworn (or Affirmed) on March 21, 2018</EM></TI>
<P>I, Trent Percy of Calgary, Alberta, SWEAR/AFFIRM AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am Surety Director, Prairies, for Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Intact is an insurance company and surety that is licensed to carry on business as such throughout Canada.</P>
<P>3. On May 28, 2015, Intact issued a Performance Bond and a Labour and Material Payment Bond, under no. XXXXXXXXXX, each in the amount of $45,870,133.00 (the &ldquo;Bonds&rdquo;), at the request of Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;) in relation to the Belle Plaine Railway Spur, grading and bridge construction project for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CPR&rdquo;) in the province of Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of the Performance Bond.</P>
<P>5. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of the Labour and Material Payment Bond.</P>
<P>6. The Bonds were executed by Maureen Matheson, Attorney-in-fact on behalf of Intact, in Saskatchewan. Ms. Matheson is a broker employed by Marsh Canada Limited in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan who may be witness for Intact at the trial.</P>
<P>7. The approval for the Bonds was given by the then Vice President Surety of Intact, Robert P. Landy, who is now resident in Mississauga, Ontario. Mr. Landy was also the first individual at Intact to receive notice from CPR of an issue with the Project, and I expect that Mr. Landy will be called as a witness on behalf of Intact at the trial of this action.</P>
<P>8. Intact has an interest in securing an early resolution of the issues arising in the dispute between CPR and KPCL. The dispute is having a negative impact on the level of bond support that Intact is in a position to provide to KPCL in respect of its ongoing operations.</P>
<P>9. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of a letter from Intact to KPCL in relation to the reduced level of bond support that Intact is in a position to provide to KPCL.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. This is the Brief of the Applicant, Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;), in support of an application for an Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CPR&rdquo;), as against the Defendant Intact for want of jurisdiction.</P>
<P>2. Further, or in the alternative, Intact seeks a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in relation to the within action, and an Order staying this action it its entirety against Intact.</P>
<P>3. On December 1, 2017, CPR filed a Statement of Claim <BOLD><UNDER>claiming</UNDER></BOLD> damages allegedly arising out of work performed by Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;) and others for the construction of a new, 30.4-km railway spur, known as the Belle Plaine Railway Spur, located between Belle Plaine and Findlater, in the Province of Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;). This action arises from alleged deficiencies in the Project.</P>
<P>4. Intact is an insurance company and surety that is licensed to carry on business as such throughout Canada. Intact's involvement in this matter arises from the fact that it <BOLD><UNDER>provided bonding support</UNDER></BOLD> at the request of KPCL in relation to the Project.</P>
<P>5. Intact supports the applications of its Co-Defendants KPCL, Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;) filed February 23, 2018, and the application of Hatch Corporation, filed March 29, 2018. Each application seeks to set aside the Statement of Claim of CPR for want of jurisdiction, or, alternatively, to stay this action on the basis that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. From both a legal and a common sense perspective, Saskatchewan is the <BOLD><UNDER>clear and sole</UNDER></BOLD> appropriate forum.</P>
<P>6. Intact has not filed a Statement of Defence in this matter, or otherwise attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts.</P>
<P>7. This application should be allowed with costs payable to Intact.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>8. Intact repeats and relies upon the summary of background facts set out in KPCL's brief, with the additions that follow.</P>
<P>9. Intact's role in relation to the Project was to issue a Performance Bond and a Labour and Material Payment Bond, under no. XXXXXXXXXX, each in the amount of $45,870,133.00 (the &ldquo;Bonds&rdquo;). The Bonds were issued at the request of KPCL on May 28, 2015.
<P1>Affidavit of Trent Percy, sworn March 21, 2018, para. 3&ndash;5, Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>10. The Bonds contemplated that the applicable legislation and jurisdiction of the Courts would be the laws and jurisdiction of the place in which the work for the Project was being performed.</P>
<P>11. The limitation period for the commencement of any suit or action under the Performance Bond is:
<QUOTE><P>before the expiration of two (2) years from the earlier of 1) the date of Substantial Performance of the Contract <BOLD>as defined in the lien legislation where the work under the Contract is taking place</BOLD>, or, if no such definition exists, <BOLD>the date when the work is ready for use or is being used</BOLD> for the purpose intended, or 2) the date on which the Principal is declared in default by the Obligee, [emphases added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. The Labour and Material Bond provides that:
<P1>(a) written notice must be provided to each of the Principal, the Surety and the Obligee, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed, and that a suit or action was brought in accordance with the Bond;</P1>
<P1>(b) the notice shall be served by registered mail &ldquo;at any place where an office is regularly maintained for the transaction of business by such persons or <BOLD>served in any manner in which legal process may be served in the Province or Territory in which the subject matter of the Contract is located</BOLD>&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) that notice of any claim for holdback arising &ldquo;under either the terms of the Claimant's contract with the Principal, <BOLD>or under the lien Legislation applicable to the Claimant's contract with the Principal</BOLD>&rdquo; shall be served within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such Claimant should have been paid under its contract; and</P1>
<P1>(d) <BOLD>precludes any claim being advanced &ldquo;other than in a Court of competent jurisdiction in the Province or Territory in which the work described in the Contract is to be installed or delivered as the case may be and not elsewhere, and the parties hereto agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such Court.</BOLD> [emphases added]</P1></P>
<P>13. The Bonds were executed by Maureen Matheson, Attorney-in-fact on behalf of Intact, in Saskatchewan. Ms. Matheson is a broker employed by Marsh Canada Limited in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Ms. Matheson may be a witness for Intact at trial.
<P1>Affidavit of T. Percy, para. 6</P1></P>
<P>14. The approval for the Bonds was given by the then Vice President Surety of Intact, Robert P. Landy, who is now resident in Mississauga, Ontario. Mr. Landy was the first individual at Intact to receive notice from CPR of an issue with the Project. Mr. Landy is likely to be called as a witness on behalf of Intact at the trial of this action.
<P1>Affidavit of T. Percy, para. 7</P1></P>
<P>15. Intact has an interest in securing an early resolution of the issues arising in the dispute between CPR and KPCL. The dispute negatively impacts the level of <UNDER>bonding</UNDER> support that Intact is in a position to provide to KPCL in respect of its ongoing operations.
<P1>Affidavit of T. Percy, paras. 8 - 9, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. ISSUES</TI>
<P>16. The following issues arise on this Application:
<P1>(a) Does the Alberta Court have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the claims made against Intact in this action?</P1>
<P1>(b) If so, should the action against Intact be stayed, in its entirety, on the basis that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>?</P1></P>
<P>17. Intact respectfully submits that this Honourable Court does not have jurisdiction over the action, and, in the alternative, if the Court finds that it has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, it should decline to exercise jurisdiction and stay this action in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>18. Intact agrees with, <UNDER>endorses</UNDER> and adopts, the discussion of the applicable jurisprudence and the arguments advanced in the Briefs of the co-Defendant Applicants.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>i)</N><TI>The Alberta Court does not have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM></TI>
<P>19. Intact submits that the Alberta Court does not have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. Intact carries on business in Alberta. However, as discussed below, Intact's presence in Alberta is <BOLD><UNDER>merely one factor that is</UNDER></BOLD> heavily outweighed by a number of relevant factors.</P>
<P>20. Intact has not consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The Bonds contain choice of jurisdiction provisions. The Performance Bond's wording implies that it is the law of the place in which the Contract is being performed that will be the law applicable to any claim that is advanced under the Performance Bond. In this case, all of the work on the Project was performed in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>21. The Labour and Materials Bond contains express wording that the governing jurisdiction is that where the work described in the Contract is to be installed or delivered. There can be no reasonable suggestion that the jurisdiction described is anywhere other than Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>22. As noted above, Intact has not filed a Statement of Defence, and filed this Application to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. Intact has not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court.</P>
<P>23. In <CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v. Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada reformulated the &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; test for determining jurisdiction, as well as the distinct <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> doctrine.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v. Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Van Breda</EM>] (Tab 1)</P1></P>
<P>24. In the recent decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v. Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF>, C&oc;t&ea; J. framed the distinction drawn in <EM>Van Breda</EM> in the following terms:
<QUOTE><P>The importance of maintaining this distinction flows from the discrete concerns underlying each analysis and the nature of the relevant factors at each stage. The &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; test at the jurisdiction simpliciter stage prioritizes order, stability and predictability by relying on objective connecting factors for the assumption of jurisdiction. Conversely, the forum non conveniens analysis emphasizes fairness and efficiency by adopting a case-by-case approach to identify whether an alternative jurisdiction may be &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v. Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Haaretz</EM>] at para. 28 (Tab 2)</P1></P>
<P>25. Both <EM>Van Breda</EM> and Rule 11.25 of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> set out presumptive connective factors to be referred to in deciding whether this Court should agree to determine a case. As formulated in <EM>Van Breda</EM>, these factors include the domicile or residence of the defendant; the defendant's business in the province; the commission of the tort in the province; and the creation of a contract in the province.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, at para. 36 (Tab 1)</P1>
<P1>Alberta Rules of Court, Alta Reg 124/2010, Rule 11.25 (Tab 3)</P1></P>
<P>26. The presumption of jurisdiction is rebuttable where there is only a weak relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, at paras. 56, 81, 95&ndash;97 (Tab 1)</P1>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, at paras. 41&ndash;43 (Tab 2)</P1></P>
<P>27. Intact submits that any connection between it and Alberta in the context of this matter is weak, and that it would not be reasonable for it to be called upon to defend this matter in Alberta. There is no &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo; connection between Alberta and the claim advanced by CPR against Intact, or between Alberta and the action generally.</P>
<P>28. Intact has offices and a business presence in Alberta as, it appears, does CPR in Saskatchewan. However, if Intact's presence in Alberta is a factor, it is a coincidental one and has no real relevance to the matters at the core of this action. Further, the location of Intact's offices/business presence is not common to all of the Defendant Applicants.</P>
<P>29. <BOLD><UNDER>The Bonds that underscore Intact's involvement in this proceeding were not issued in Alberta.</UNDER></BOLD> The governing law of the Bonds is not Alberta, and thus not a presumptive connecting factor. It is clear from the wording of the Bonds that they are governed by the law of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>30. Nevertheless, should this Honourable Court find a presumptive connecting factor between Alberta and the claims made against Intact, that connection is clearly rebutted.</P>
<P>31. The Bonds were issued at the request of KPCL for a Project involving lands and work in Saskatchewan. The Bonds were issued in Saskatchewan, and are governed by of the law of Saskatchewan. These are clearly overriding considerations, and Intact submits that there are no compelling factors that favour Alberta.</P>
<P>32. In summary, Intact submits that the application should be allowed on the basis that Alberta is not jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii)</N><TI>In the alternative, the Alberta Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction</TI>
<P>33. Further, or in the alternative, if Alberta has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over this action or Intact, which Intact denies, this Honourable Court should decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that Alberta is not an appropriate or convenient, or clearly most appropriate or convenient forum to adjudicate the whole of this action. Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. This matter should be adjudicated before the courts of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>34. At the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> stage, the court is requested to determine if alternative forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; Its purpose is to &ldquo;temper any rigidity in the rules governing the assumption of jurisdiction&rdquo; and promote fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, at paras. 46 - 47 (Tab 2)</P1></P>
<P>35. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court explained the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis in the following way:
<QUOTE><P>... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation. But the court must be mindful that jurisdiction may sometimes be established on a rather low threshold under the conflicts rules. <BOLD><EM>Forum non conveniens</EM> may play an important role in identifying a forum that is clearly more appropriate for disposing of the litigation and thus ensuring fairness to the parties and a more efficient process for resolving their dispute.</BOLD> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, at para. 109 (Tab 1)</P1></P>
<P>36. Intact submits that the fairness and efficiency considerations are clearly satisfied. Saskatchewan is the clearly most appropriate or convenient forum for the adjudication of the disputes raised in or related to the matters raised in this action. Saskatchewan is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) The Project that is at the core of the dispute in this action was performed in Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan has the real and substantial connection to the claims made in the action, and is clearly the sole appropriate forum.</P1>
<P1>(b) Read as a whole, the Bonds contemplate that any claims under the Bonds are to be determined in accordance with the laws of the place in which the work under the Contract is performed and that the Courts of the place where the Contract is being performed will have exclusive jurisdiction to determine such claims.</P1>
<P1>(c) The work performed under the Bonded Contract was entirely performed in Saskatchewan, and litigation involving KPCL and CPR already exists in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in relation to the Project. The other parties to this action may become involved in the Saskatchewan litigation or other possible litigation in relation to the Project. It is well-established that avoiding inconsistent findings is important to the courts and parties to a lawsuit. With a multiplicity of actions in different provinces, there is a risk of conflicting judgments. Intact may be exposed to a multiplicity of actions if the action is not stayed in Alberta, and CPR will suffer no such prejudice or harm if it is transferred by CPR to Saskatchewan.</P1>
<P1>(d) The majority of the potential fact witnesses reside in Saskatchewan. No evidence was filed regarding CPR's witnesses.</P1>
<P1>(e) Similarly, it is reasonable to assume, based on the fact that the Project was in Saskatchewan, that the physical evidence is located in Saskatchewan.</P1></P>
<P>37. There is no other forum which is clearly more appropriate than Saskatchewan, and the majority of the parties favour Saskatchewan. It is fair, just, efficient and convenient for this action to be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan. Intact submits that Saskatchewan is clearly the best forum once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>38. Intact requests the following relief:
<P1>(a) An Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff CPR as against the Defendant Intact for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>(b) Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> in relation to the whole of the action, and an Order staying this action in its entirety against Intact;</P1>
<P1>(c) Costs of this Application; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted this 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of June, 2018.</P>

</TBLROW>
</TBLROWS>
</TBLBODY>
</SGMLTBL></TABLE></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. At issue in this application is whether this claim, which was appropriately filed by Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in the Alberta Courts and which has a real and substantial connection to Alberta, should nonetheless be transferred to Saskatchewan to suit the interests of the single defendant formally domiciled there.</P>
<P>2. CP, a federal corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, filed the Statement of Claim in this Action on December 1, 2017. In its Statement of Claim, CP sets out causes of action against defendants spread across Canada. The claim involves allegations of breach of contract and negligence arising out of the design and construction of a rail spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan that forms part of CP's national rail network (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP moved forward with the litigation, serving its Statement of Claim on the various defendants between January 8 and January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>3. The defendants are located across Canada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Four of the six defendants have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, with two of those having filed defences and one filing Notices to Co-defendants.</P>
<P>4. Despite this, certain of the defendants&mdash;including two who have contractually attorned&mdash;have chosen to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably in an effort to create delay and inconvenience to CP in the handling of this Action.</P>
<P>5. There is, however, no basis upon which to set aside this claim in which two defendants have already defended and have brought no motions to challenge jurisdiction or strike the claim. There is a real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which this Action is based, and the parties not resident in Alberta are necessary and proper parties to this Action</P>
<P>6. While the Belle Plaine Project was constructed in Saskatchewan, the bulk of the design and engineering work was completed in Alberta. The majority of those <UNDER>likely</UNDER> to be questioned or to appear as witnesses at trial are either in Alberta or are in jurisdictions other than Saskatchewan, with the result that comparative convenience either favours proceeding in Alberta, or is a neutral factor. The law applicable to several of the contracts at issue is the law of Alberta, where all but one of the parties to this Action carry on business and where many of the physical records regarding this claim are located.</P>
<P>7. Efficiency and fairness also favour proceeding in Alberta. All of the principal actors involved in the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project are parties to this Action, and the most reasonable means to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings is to allow this Action to proceed in the usual course. Further, given the number of individuals the parties have already identified as likely to be required for Questioning, Alberta's more robust Rules regarding Questioning are better suited to allowing the complex facts underlying this claim to be brought to light, which will assist in the assessment and potential resolution of the claims.</P>
<P>8. The fact that the Saskatchewan Courts also have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the subject matter of this claim does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court and, given the strong connection of the parties and the subject matter of this litigation to Alberta, Saskatchewan cannot be shown to be a clearly more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>9. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project was underway from 2012 to 2017. To facilitate construction, CP contracted with the defendants, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) to provide engineering and construction services.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the failures on the part of Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL and Altus (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork embankment adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River collapsed (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks.</P>
<P>11. CP initiated the within Action to recover the damages it suffered as a result of the Embankment Failure. CP's Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Defendant Contractors is liable to CP for breach of contract and in negligence. The Statement of Claim also alleges negligent misrepresentation as against Clifton and advances a breach of contract claim against Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), which issued a performance bond in respect of KPCL's work.</P>
<P>12. CP is a federal corporation with its registered office and headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. With few exceptions, the majority of the CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;Panteluk Affidavit&rdquo;), paras 18 and 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project. CP's allegations as against Hatch in respect of the deficiencies in Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project sound in both contract and tort.</P>
<P>14. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton sworn March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 8 and Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Effective January 1, 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Hatch contracted to provide professional engineering services as required by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Although Hatch initially sought to have its work on the Belle Plaine Project formalized through a distinct contract between itself and CP, it subsequently <UNDER>requested</UNDER> that its work on the Belle Plaine Project be brought within the existing Hatch Contract. CP's acceptance of the Hatch proposal was expressly subject to Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project being undertaken pursuant to the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibits F, G and H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Hatch carries on business in Alberta, with offices in both Calgary and Edmonton,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 12 to the Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;McArdle Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and conducted the initial design work for the Belle Plaine Project at its office in Calgary, Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This was in keeping with the proposal Hatch provided for the work on the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;), which identified 11 individuals as the personnel who would be working on the design and engineering of the Belle Plaine Project, all but two of whom were in Alberta (with none in Saskatchewan).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, para 6 and Schedule A at pages 20&ndash;32, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The Hatch Contract reflects the express agreement between Hatch and CP as to the law that would govern and the forum in which disputes would be determined, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch dated January 1, 2012 (&ldquo;Hatch Contract&rdquo;), section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The vast majority of the Hatch employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project, including the Project Managers, Directors and Engineers, were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hatch's Project Manager for the Belle Plaine Project was based in Calgary throughout the period while Hatch was performing the work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, including at the time of the Embankment Failure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 5; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. As set out in the Hatch Proposal, although Hatch was to be the &ldquo;prime consultant&rdquo; and would rely on its &ldquo;strong, multi-discipline Calgary-based team&rdquo;, Hatch also proposed retaining its &ldquo;exclusive subconsultants&rdquo;, including Thurber, to assist with work on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit at para 6 and Schedule A at page 33, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its contractual obligations to CP under the Hatch Contract, Hatch was required to ensure that any subcontractors strictly adhered to all of the terms of the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 6 of Schedule A, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Thurber, which is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was retained by Hatch pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd., filed April 5, 2018 at para 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice to Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Thurber Engineering Ltd. are attached as Appendix A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Thurber carries on business in Alberta and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP/Thurber Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Thurber Corporation dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On April 5, 2018, Thurber filed a Statement of Defence and Notices of Claim against Co-Defendants in this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd. and Notice to Co-defendants filed April 5, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Through its Notices to Co-defendants, Thurber is seeking contribution and indemnity from each of the other defendants in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact.</P>
<P>23. Clifton was also involved in providing geotechnical and environmental engineering services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Clifton provided construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Clifton is a federal corporation which maintains its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan and has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 2 and 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Supply of Services Retainer into which CP and Clifton had entered effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Retainer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 6 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Correspondence between CP and Clifton in respect of the Clifton Retainer was exchanged between their respective offices in Calgary and Regina. After having been executed on behalf of Clifton, the Clifton Retainer was executed and accepted by CP in Calgary and returned to Clifton by mail or courier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The Clifton Retainer prescribes the applicable law and jurisdiction:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Later, on April 8, 2015, CP and Clifton entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) under which Clifton was to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11; Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Clifton dated April 8, 2016 (&ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Like the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract reflects the express agreement between CP and Clifton prescribing the law applicable to the Clifton Contract and the forum in which disputes would be adjudicated, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project involved a significant earthworks component, in respect of which CP contracted with KPCL.</P>
<P>31. KPCL provides both construction and earthmoving services and was the main construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 5, 7 and 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's contractual responsibilities pursuant to the contract in place between it and CP included the construction of the Qu-Appelle River crossing and adjacent embankments,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> one of which is the subject matter of this Action.</P>
<P>32. Throughout the course of its work on the Belle Plaine Project and, indeed, until approximately one month after KPCL was served with the Statement of Claim in this Action, KPCL was registered in Alberta as an extra-provincial corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; First Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of KPCL dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 6, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. Altus, which is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta and maintains its head office within Alberta, provided survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project under an agreement between CP and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, paras 3 and 4. A copy of the Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership is attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On April 27, 2018, Altus filed a Statement of Defence to this Action. While Altus has not filed Notices to Co-defendants, in its Statement of Defence, Altus pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c C-27 and the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c T-5.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix B: Statement of Defence on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. Intact is the only defendant to this Action not directly involved in the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project. The Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL required KPCL to provide CP with a performance bond through a duly licensed surety company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL dated March 12, 2015 (&ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;), section GC35, Exhibit 8 to the Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Intact was selected as that company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Intact, a federally regulated company,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carries on business and maintains offices in Alberta and is licensed to provide insurance in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories dated June 12 2018 (&ldquo;Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 1&ndash;3, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. On or about May 28, 2015, Intact issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP for the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Performance Bond issued by Intact to KPCL on May 28, 2015, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Percy Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Despite having guaranteed the performance of KPCL's obligations with respect to the Belle Plaine Project, which included construction of the embankment that failed, Intact has refused to act upon the bond to address KPCL's defaults. Intact's failure to honour its obligations under the performance bond left CP in the position of having to fund all of the work in connection with KPCL's failures, without the benefit of the bond provided.</P>
<P>39. KPCL alleges that proceedings in Alberta will have a detrimental impact on KPCL's finances and its operations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g. Panteluk Affidavit, paras 85 and 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet has remarkably refused to provide any of its financial information,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 28, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to Second Notice to Admit Facts dated June 8, 2018, para 5, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the inference being that the financial information would not support the allegations. In a similar vein, Intact initially provided sworn evidence that this dispute is presently having an impact on the bonding support Intact is able to provide to KPCL,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet both KPCL and Intact have since confirmed that no such impact has been felt.</P>
<P>40. KPCL, for its part, concedes that it has not turned down any jobs, or declined to bid on any jobs, due to unavailability of bonding support or limitations on the scope of bonding available to it, whether through Intact or any other surety provider.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 11, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 5 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, Intact has confirmed that at no time between January 1, 2016 and April 2018 has it refused any request for bonding from KPCL, nor has it reduced the amount of any bond issued to KPCL or otherwise limited the scope of bonding available to KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 4 and 6, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, the allegations of financial impact have no substantiation.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. CP's Statement of Claim was served soon after it was filed, as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was served in Estevan, Saskatchewan on January 10, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) Thurber was served in Victoria, British Columbia on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch was served in Mississauga, Ontario on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Intact was served in Calgary, Alberta on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(e) Altus was served in Edmonton, Alberta on January 11, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Clifton was served in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 19, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>42. On February 6, 2018, almost a full month after service of the Statement of Claim in this Action, counsel for KPCL sought confirmation that an extension would be granted in respect of KPCL's Statement of Defence and that CP would not take any steps against KPCL in the interim. It is surely not a coincidence that until February 6, 2018, KPCL was registered with Alberta Registries as an extra-provincial corporation in the province of Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule A, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, paras 6 and 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Unbeknownst to CP, KPCL had previously filed a Statement of Claim against CP in Regina in Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 2177/2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;). Like the within Action, KPCL's Saskatchewan Action concerns the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>44. Although KPCL's Saskatchewan Action was filed in August 2017, KPCL took no steps to serve the claim at that point, but instead waited more than five months, including almost a full month <UNDER>after</UNDER> CP served the Statement of Claim in this Action upon KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 1, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 5, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Interestingly, it was not until February 7, 2018, after having secured CP's agreement to an extension in respect of its own Statement of Defence, that KPCL served CP with the KPCL Saskatchewan Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule B, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Upon receipt of KPCL's Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, CP immediately advised KPCL that it considered jurisdiction to be an issue in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action. Indeed, KPCL already knew that, as CP had initiated this Action in Alberta. On February 9, 2018, in the interests of efficiency and practicality, CP proposed that the jurisdictional issues in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action be addressed as part of KPCL's planned application in respect of jurisdiction before this Court, obviating the need for a duplicate application before the Saskatchewan Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule C, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and thereby minimizing the cost and time associated with trying to deal with similar motions in separate jurisdictions.</P>
<P>46. KPCL refused. Rather, KPCL insisted that it was unable to consider CP's proposal until CP had filed an application of its own challenging jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, presumably for strategic reasons. KPCL also refused CP's request for an extension of time in respect of CP's Statement of Defence in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule D, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. Indeed, although KPCL filed its application challenging jurisdiction on February 8, 2018, it subsequently took the position that it was unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, Exhibits N-II, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only after forcing a court appearance to address scheduling were the Jurisdiction Applications set down for July 4 and 5, 2018.</P>
<P>48. Despite the existence of not only CP's claim in the within Action, but its own claim in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, both of which raise issues in respect of the obligations between CP and KPCL on the Belle Plaine Project and the performance of those obligations, on March 5, 2018 KPCL filed yet another claim against CP by way of Originating Application under Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 655/2018, seeking payment of holdback funds relating to the Belle Plaine Project (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 16 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. CP sought a stay of the need to challenge jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and KPCL's Originating Application (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Actions</BOLD>&rdquo;), pending the determination of the Jurisdiction Applications. CP's application was heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow in Regina on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit, paras 4 - 5 .</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Justice Chow was advised of KPCL's pending jurisdictional challenge before the Alberta Courts. CP argued that the need to bring an application in Saskatchewan to challenge jurisdiction was contrary to the foundational Rules in Saskatchewan and Alberta of trying to address matters in an efficient and cost effective manner, when the precise issue was to be determined in Alberta on July 4 and 5. KPCL, through its opposition to that and in filing further claims in Saskatchewan, seems opposed to the suggestion of efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>50. CP has not yet filed an application challenging jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and, accordingly, such applications&mdash;should they become necessary&mdash;have not yet been set down, let alone heard. It follows that neither of the Saskatchewan Actions have yet been set down for hearing.</P>
<P>51. On December 1, 2017, CP also filed a claim as against Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;) in QB Action No. 1701-16251 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh Action</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A copy of the Statement of Claim filed on behalf of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in QB Action No. 1701-16251 is attached as Appendix C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Marsh Action also concerns the Belle Plaine Project, but is specific to CP's allegations that breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of Marsh, which provided insurance brokerage services to CP, including in respect of insurance on the Belle Plaine Project, have resulted in damages to CP.</P>
<P>52. Marsh has undertaken to defend in the March Action and will not be challenging jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. DISCUSSION</TI>
<P>53. The analysis of the jurisdictional questions raised in respect of this Action has two distinct parts: the first addresses the jurisdiction of the Court <EM>simpliciter</EM>, while the second concerns the issue of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Haaretz</EM></BOLD>], para 27, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>101&ndash;105</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Van Breda</EM></BOLD>] <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. Jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is based upon the existence of a real and substantial connection between the forum and the subject matter of an action, as demonstrated by the presence of one or more presumptive connecting factors. To rebut a presumed real and substantial connection, the party challenging jurisdiction must establish that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the claim is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction.&rdquo; The factors upon which the party seeking to rebut a presumed real and substantial connection should not be those considered during the second stage of the analysis, as the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is, and must remain, distinct.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 43, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 56, 81, 92 and 97</P1></P>
<P>55. Once jurisdiction is established through the real and substantial connection test, the claim will proceed in that jurisdiction unless a party challenging jurisdiction is able to show that exceptional circumstances exist such that another jurisdiction is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; The bar is high&mdash;the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that:
<QUOTE><P>The use of the words &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo; should be interpreted as an acknowledgment that the normal state of affairs is that jurisdiction should be exercised once it is properly assumed. ... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 46, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 109</P1></P>
<P>56. Assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is multi-factorial and requires a Court to consider the overall fairness and efficiency of proceeding in one jurisdiction as opposed to another, as determined based on factors ranging from the law applicable to the dispute to the location of physical evidence to the comparative convenience and expense for the parties and likely witnesses.</P>
<P>57. In this instance, the presumptive connecting factors between this claim and Alberta ground the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> of the Alberta courts and there is no sound basis upon which the applying defendants may rebut this presumption.</P>
<P>58. Further, the applying defendants have failed to show that this matter invokes the exceptional circumstances that justify a determination that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum in which to have this Action heard.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> by Consent</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. In this instance, four of the six defendants (Thurber, Altus, Clifton and Hatch) have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. That fact, in itself, is sufficient to resolve the question of whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, to the extent that any such question truly arose. The real and substantial connection is between the forum and the subject of the action, not a particular or specific party.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Governing Principles</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. Parties are always at liberty to consent to a Court's jurisdiction. As confirmed by this Honourable Court, consent:
<QUOTE><P>permits jurisdiction over an extra-provincial defendant who consents, whether by voluntary submission, <UNDER><EM>attornment by appearance and defence</EM>, or prior agreement</UNDER> to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the domestic court.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Limited v Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 ABQB 442</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Norex</EM></BOLD>], para 49, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt et al v Carcelles et al</SOC><CITE>2002 OJ No 2128</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 19 [italicized emphasis in original, underline emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. If a party attorns, or consents contractually or otherwise to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the matter.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc v Research In Motion Ltd</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Meta4Hand</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. Participation in the litigation process also constitutes attornment, and it is well established that when a party defends a lawsuit on the merits, it has implicitly submitted or attorned to the jurisdiction of the court in which the action was brought.
<P1><EM>Norex</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50</P1>

<P>63. It is also open to parties to enter into commercial agreements regarding the forum in which disputes between them are to be adjudicated, and it is &ldquo;essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding contracting parties to [such] agreements.&rdquo; Where there is a valid agreement that includes an agreement as to jurisdiction, consideration of whether there is a real and substantial connection to the forum is redundant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>ZI Pompey</EM></BOLD>], paras 20 and 21, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD></P1>

<P>64. Forum selection clauses are a distinct element in consideration of jurisdiction, and should not be subsumed within the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. Further, forum selection clauses should be enforced unless there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to do so. In this respect, the burden is on the party challenging jurisdiction to &ldquo;show sufficiently strong reasons to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just in the circumstances to require the [challenging party] to adhere to the terms of the clause.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>ZI Pompey</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 20, 21 and 39</P1></P>
<P>65. Inconvenience does not amount to strong cause. It is, for example, not open to parties who have entered into a contractual agreement with respect to forum to complain later that the evidence and witnesses may not be within that jurisdiction. Such facts either were or ought to have been known prior to entering into the agreement containing the forum selection provision and, to the extent that posed a concern, the appropriate time to raise the issue is at the time of contract negotiation. Allowing the location of witnesses and evidence to be raised after the fact would undermine commercially negotiated agreements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Atlantic Cement Carriers Ltd v Atlantic Towing Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 761</CITE><PARANUM>21 and 24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. In terms of their substance, forum selection clauses fall along a spectrum, from contracts which contain no such provisions to those which contain exclusive jurisdiction provisions under which the parties choose a single forum for the adjudication of disputes.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v Megawheels Technologies Inc</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 4493</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Megawheels</EM></BOLD>], para 19, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. While even an exclusive attornment provision does not oust the jurisdiction of a local court, courts give significant weight to exclusive attornment provisions and should not interfere with the parties' selection of forum attornment provisions &ldquo;unless it is shown that the matter cannot be properly dealt with in the foreign court.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 20</P1></P>
<P>68. Non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions also carry significant weight. In <CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp. v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Virtue described such clauses as &ldquo;important consideration[s]&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; in the context of a forum selection clause means that the parties have attorned to that jurisdiction &ldquo;except in matters where some extraordinary condition or reason would require that the matter be determined elsewhere.&rdquo; Once a suit arises in the selected jurisdiction, the parties will be required to attorn.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>136 AR 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 28, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 10</BOLD></P1>

<P>69. Unsurprisingly, the operation of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is more limited in scope than that of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Essentially, under a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, &ldquo;either party may sue the other wherever it has the right to do so&rdquo;, but once one party initiates a suit in the named jurisdiction, the other party must keep its bargain by attorning to that jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 28</P1></P>
<P>70. While a forum selection clause must be applicable to the dispute in question in order to be given effect, it is inappropriate to parse the wordings of forum selection clauses too closely to determine whether they apply to the claims as pleaded, as this can foster &ldquo;dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution.&rdquo; Courts interpret jurisdiction clauses broadly, and have rejected an approach in which fine distinctions are drawn based upon the language used.
<P1>Rafferty and Pitel, <EM>Conflict of Laws</EM>, 2nd ed (Irwin law: Toronto, 2010) at 131-132, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 12</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12</P1></P>
<P>71. Where a claim of negligence has arisen in a contractual relationship based upon an agreement which contains a forum selection clause, the forum selection is equally applicable to a claim in tort unless the clause clearly does <UNDER>not</UNDER> cover the dispute.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12-11-13</P1></P>
<P>72. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered a claim in which the plaintiff had entered into two contracts with the defendants, one of which contained a forum selection clause through which the parties agreed that &ldquo;any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this Agreement&rdquo; was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and the other of which contained no forum selection clause. The plaintiff sued in Ontario for negligent misrepresentation based upon the second contract. The defendants successfully sought a stay based upon the forum selection provision in the other contract, with the Court concluding that the claims in negligence were intertwined with the contract, making it inevitable that the contract would be before the court as part of the factual narrative and through the reliance of the defendants upon the contract in their defences, such that there was no basis not to enforce the forum selection provision.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 2823</CITE><PARANUM>1, 2, 14 and 29</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 13</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>73. Thurber and Altus, having filed Statements of Defence that address the substance of the claims against them, have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. The claims against them arising from the Belle Plains Project will proceed in Alberta. As well, the notices for contribution and indemnity will also, presumably, proceed.</P>
<P>74. Hatch and Clifton have also attorned, through their respective contracts with CP, to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts in respect of this Action.</P>
<P>75. The validity of the Clifton Retainer, Clifton Contract and Hatch Contract is unchallenged, and there is no suggestion that this matter cannot properly be dealt with by the Alberta Courts.</P>
<P>76. Clifton and CP attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract. Under the Clifton Retainer, CP and Clifton &ldquo;attorn[ed] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Contract, for its part, stipulates that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reflecting Clifton's attornment to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>77. Both Hatch and CP attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts through the Hatch Contract, which states that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The attornment provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract contain no limitation as to subject matter scope. Certainly, they contain nothing that would suggest that they &ldquo;clearly [do] not&rdquo; cover claims in either breach of contract or tort, and it would be absurd to suggest that these provisions do not apply to breaches of the very contracts in which they appear.</P>
<P>79. This is consistent with the wording of the attornment provisions. In each of these Contracts, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is a long and detailed contract, expressly including not just the portion containing the terms in which the forum selection provisions are set out, but associated schedules providing descriptions of services, minimum requirements for personnel, security requirements, and other details regarding the work to be performed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, page 1, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit; Clifton Retainer, page 1, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, page 1, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More importantly, through the Hatch Contract, the Clifton Contract and the Clifton Retainer, Clifton and Hatch expressly agreed to provide services, meaning their engineering and design work in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; bringing not only contractual interpretation but the performance of the contract squarely within <UNDER>all</UNDER> of the terms of the Agreements, including the forum selection provision.</P>
<P>80. The proper interpretation of a forum selection clause was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the contractual duty of good faith, and alternatively for breach of agency duty and wrongful dismissal. The defendant applied for a stay of the action in British Columbia based upon the forum selection provision in the contract between the parties, which read:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Saskatchewan in respect of its interpretation or breach.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1700</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>81. The claim launched was almost wholly unrelated to either the interpretation or breach of the contract that contained the jurisdiction clause, with the Court noting that it was not a case in which the parties &ldquo;had a difference of opinion over the interpretation of the contract or alleged the other to be in breach of it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 53</P1></P>
<P>82. That is in sharp contrast to the present situation.</P>
<P>83. Here, there is no limitation upon the scope of the attornment provisions. Clifton and Hatch suggest that the absence of a limitation somehow indicates that the provisions are limited to interpretation. This, with respect, is a transparent effort to create ambiguity where none exists and should not be permitted.</P>
<P>84. CP, Clifton and Hatch have attorned (either exclusively or nonexclusively) to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;full stop. That attornment is, as suggested by the whole of each provision, in respect of the &ldquo;Agreements.&rdquo; CP's claims against both Hatch and Clifton expressly allege that those defendants are in breach of their respective Agreements with CP, bringing the claims directly within the scope of the forum selection provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Contract and Clifton Retainer.</P>
<P>85. The Clifton Contract contains an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, as there is no suggestion that this claim cannot be properly dealt with by the Alberta Courts, there is no reason to interfere with this contractual provision.</P>
<P>86. The Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer contain non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions. Given that CP has filed the Statement of Claim in the within Action in Alberta&mdash;the selected forum&mdash;both Clifton and Hatch are contractually bound to the jurisdiction.</P>
<P>87. To the extent that this Honourable Court finds that the wording of the forum selection provision in the Clifton Contract allowed CP to begin proceedings in other jurisdiction affects the exclusivity of the provision in respect of Clifton (rather than CP alone, per the wording of the clause), the only result would be to transform the provision into one in which both parties had attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The provision would then operate in the same way as the provisions within the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer, meaning that Clifton would be required to attorn to CP's Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>88. In addition to the breach of contract claims set out in CP's Statement of Claim, claims of negligence have arisen within CP's contractual relationships with both Hatch and Clifton. CP's claims in contract and tort are intertwined, making this a situation in which the contractual attornment provisions are applicable to both.</P>
<P>89. For the foregoing reasons, the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> based upon the consent of Thurber, Altus, Hatch and Clifton. There is no reason, let alone strong cause, to oust this jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Via Real and Substantial Connection</UNDER></TI>
<P>90. A court has jurisdiction over an action if there is a real and substantial connection between the action and the court's territory. The assumption of jurisdiction is justified under the real and substantial connection test where objective factors, as identified by the courts, connect the plaintiff's claim to the chosen forum. It is not necessary to show the <UNDER>most</UNDER> real and substantial connection, only that such a connection exists.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 4</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 15</BOLD></P1>

<P>91. Further, a real and substantial connection between one alleged cause of action and the jurisdiction is sufficient to ground a Court's jurisdiction over the whole. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, Justice LeBel was explicit on this point, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>it is possible for a case to sound both in contract and in tort or to invoke more than one tort. Would a court be limited to hearing the specific part of the case that can be directly connected with the jurisdiction? Such a rule would breach the principles of fairness and efficiency on which the assumption of jurisdiction is based. The purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation and the defendant. If such a connection exists in respect of a factual and legal situation, the court must assume jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. The plaintiff should not be obliged to litigate a tort claim in Manitoba and a related claim for restitution in Nova Scotia. That would be incompatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 99</P1></P>
<P>92. The following factors were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 90</P1></P>
<P>93. Where one of the factors giving rise to a real and substantial connection is present, the defendant bears the burden of rebutting the presumed connection. Rebutting the presumption, however, requires the party challenging jurisdiction to show that the connection is so weak that it would not be reasonable for that party to expect to be called to answer proceedings in the forum with which the real and substantial connection exists.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 95 and 97</P1>
<P1><EM>Ayles</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 27</P1></P>
<P>94. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada also recognized that, where there is a real and substantial connection for the purpose of satisfying the applicable rule for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection may be presumed to exist. While procedural directives such as the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> do not <UNDER>establish</UNDER> jurisdiction, they &ldquo;represent an expression of wisdom and experience drawn from the life of the law&rdquo; and &ldquo;are based on objective facts that may also indicate when courts can properly assume jurisdiction.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 43 and 83</P1></P>
<P>95. In Alberta, the factors to be considered in assessing whether service <EM>ex juris</EM> is appropriate are set out in Rule 11.25(3), which states in part that:
<QUOTE><P>... in the following circumstances a real and substantial connection is presumed to exist: ...</P>
<P>(b) the claim relates to a contract or alleged contract made, performed or breached in Alberta;</P>
<P>(c) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta;...</P>
<P>(d) the claim relates to a tort committed in Alberta;...</P>
<P>(g) the defendant is resident in Alberta; ...</P>
<P>(i) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta Reg 124/2010, rule 11.25(3) [<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>96. The analysis of jurisdiction simpliciter set out in <EM>Van Breda</EM> and the procedural rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM> are to be integrated in reaching a decision as to jurisdiction. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court concluded that for the purpose of service, the &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; connecting factor is a presumptive connecting factor where the subject matter of the action is connected to Alberta and the other principal players in the dispute are Alberta corporations. This only makes sense, otherwise different claims, involving different parties would need to be litigated in different jurisdictions even though they arise from a common set of facts. That could not, to use Justice Lebel's words, be compatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Arcis</BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>97. In <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc. v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Farrington relied upon <EM>Arcis</EM> as a post-<EM>Van Breda</EM> case that specifically retains &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; as a presumptive connecting factor, grounding a finding that the Court had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in part on the necessary and proper party connection.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 402</CITE><PARANUM>26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Jebco</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>98. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility</SOC></CASEREF> this Court affirmed that the factors set out in Rule 11. 25(3), including whether a defendant is a proper and necessary party, constitute presumptive real and substantial connections for the purpose of a jurisdictional analysis.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 36</CITE><PARANUM>54 and 59</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>99. Accordingly, factors establishing a presumptive real and substantial connection include:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) a contract connected with the dispute was made, performed or breached in the province;</P>
<P>(d) the tort was committed in the province;</P>
<P>(e) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta; and</P>
<P>(f) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>100. In addition, while the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not a <EM>prima facie</EM> connecting factor, in <EM>Van Breda</EM> the Court suggested that the plaintiff's location is nonetheless relevant, stating that the:
<QUOTE><P>... presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not, <UNDER>on its own</UNDER>, a sufficient connecting factor. ... <UNDER>Absent other considerations,</UNDER> the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction will not create a presumptive relationship between the forum and either the subject matter of the litigation or the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 86 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>101. In this case, while CP's presence in Alberta does not, on its own, establish the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, the fact that CP is resident and carries on business in Alberta is a further factor in favour of maintaining Alberta jurisdiction.</P>

<P>106. CP's Statement of Claim is also connected to a contract made in Alberta.</P>

<P>108. Thurber was retained by Hatch to provide geotechnical services for the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 4; Subcontract Agreement between Hatch and Thurber dated November 27, 2012 (&ldquo;Thurber Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber Contract was made between two parties who have identified themselves as within Alberta,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, preamble at page 1, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and was signed by individuals confirmed to have been in Alberta during the course of the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Correspondence from Thurber to Hatch in which the contract was negotiated was sent from Thurber's office in Calgary to Hatch's office in Edmonton.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Contract, Exhibit B, Exhibit 11 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>109. In its Statement of Claim, CP raises allegations in respect of the Thurber Statement of Claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 71&ndash;76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its defence, Thurber, in turn, relies upon the allegation that it met all of its obligations under the Thurber Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Thurber Statement of Defence, para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>110. The Thurber Contract was made in Alberta and is connected to the subject matter of this dispute&mdash;this amounts to another presumptive real and substantial connection with Alberta.</P>
<P>111. Performance of a contract in Alberta is, equally, a presumptive real and substantial connection factor. Performance of a contract involves the fulfillment of an obligation or a promise under that contract.
<P1><EM>Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary</EM>, 7th ed., <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>112. In this case, both Hatch and Thurber had contractual obligations to perform engineering and geotechnical work on behalf of CP as part of the Belle Plaine Project. That work was carried out in Alberta.</P>
<P>113. Hatch employees involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the initial design work performed by Hatch was done within its office in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>114. Similarly, all of the Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit at paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>115. The work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, which was the driving purpose underlying the Hatch Contract, was performed in Alberta. Likewise, Thurber's work under the Thurber Contract, through which it provided engineering and geotechnical work for the Belle Plaine Project, occurred within Alberta. The performance of these contracts in Alberta constitutes a further real and substantial connection between Alberta and this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Tort Committed in the Province</UNDER></TI>
<P>116. In addition to its claims in breach of contract and tort, CP alleges that Clifton is liable for negligent misrepresentations contained within the proposal Clifton submitted prior to the execution of the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim, paras 91<EM>ff</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>117. The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs where the representation is received or acted upon. It is, moreover, foreseeable that misrepresentations sent to a plaintiff's office in one jurisdiction would be received and relied upon by the plaintiff in another province. If the defendant foresees that its representations will be received or acted upon within a particular jurisdiction, it should expect to be called to account in proceedings in that jurisdiction. As explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal, &ldquo;[i]n the modem world where corporations have various offices in various locations, corporate defendants should not escape liability simply because they send studies [the studies being the source of the alleged misrepresentation] to an office of the plaintiff outside Ontario with the clear understanding that it will be acted on in Ontario.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>2249659 Ontario Ltd v Sparkasse Siegan</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 354</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 23</BOLD></P1>

<P>118. The CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were predominantly in Alberta as the Belle Plaine Project was being designed and constructed. Clifton cannot have expected anything other than that its proposal for the Belle Plaine Project, which contained the misrepresentations upon which CP relied, would be acted upon within Alberta, especially as Clifton had communicated with CP in Calgary in respect of the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 8 and 15; Affidavit of Wayne Clifton sworn June 15, 2018, para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clifton met with CP in Calgary to discuss its work prior to providing the proposal containing the misrepresentations<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 9 and 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and agreed to provide all applicable notices under the Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract to CP in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 24 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, section 25 of Schedule A and section 6 of Schedule B, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit,.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 11.25(3)</P1></P>
<P>120. The Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract, and the Hatch Contract are all governed by the law of Alberta, pursuant to the following stipulation:

<P>122. The test for determining whether an extra-territorial defendant is a necessary and proper party to a claim so as to confer jurisdiction turns on whether:

<P>123. The &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; factor is a presumptive connecting factor for the purposes of determining jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.

<P>124. Altus is an Alberta corporation and was served in Alberta. The only question under this factor in the analysis is whether the other defendants, had they been in Alberta, would have been proper parties to the claim.</P>
<P>125. The answer to this question in respect of each of the other defendants is resoundingly yes.</P>
<P>126. Clifton concedes that it is a necessary and proper party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Brief of Law on Behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd. filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Brief&rdquo;), para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, each of the briefs filed on behalf of the Applicants appears to contemplate that if the claim were to proceed in Saskatchewan, all of the parties presently involved would continue as parties in that forum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Brief, para 65; Brief of Law of KPCL filed June 15, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Brief&rdquo;), para 102; Brief of Law of Hatch filed June 15, 2018, para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>127. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is distinct from, and irrelevant to, the question of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 27-28</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 101</P1></P>
<P>128. Where a Court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a real and substantial connection, it retains a residual discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that it is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and that another forum is preferable. The onus is on the party seeking a stay on this basis to show that an alternate forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, based not upon the preferences of the parties as KPCL suggests,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 133&ndash;136.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but upon the requirements of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 105 and 108</P1></P>
<P>129. A proper <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis does not dissect the claims in an effort to separate constituent causes of action or claims against individual parties that might, in the absence of the larger proceeding, be outside the jurisdiction of the court in which an action has been filed. Rather, where multiple claims are brought within one proceeding, the action is to be considered as a whole to assess whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, supra at 13&ndash;23</P1></P>
<P>130. As with jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing a challenge to jurisdiction based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court identified the following as potentially relevant, depending on the context:
<P1>(a) the locations of parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 110</P1></P>
<P>131. The factors identified in the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's <EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> are also relevant to assessing forum <EM>non conveniens</EM>, even where, as here, the forum challenged has not adopted that type of legislation.
<P1><EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> [<BOLD><EM>CJPTA</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 26</BOLD></P1>

<P>132. Accordingly, the following <EM>CJPTA</EM> factors are also relevant when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum;</P1>
<P1>(b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding;</P1>
<P1>(c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts;</P1>
<P1>(e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole.</P1>

</TBLBODY>
</SGMLTBL></TABLE></P>
<P>135. As this shows, of 48 likely witnesses CP has identified to date, 18 (or 33%) are in Saskatchewan, 16 are in Alberta, and the remainder are either outside both jurisdictions or in unknown locations.</P>
<P>136. Regardless of the jurisdiction in which this Action is heard, it will undoubtedly be inconvenient for witnesses to travel from one jurisdiction to another for questioning and, eventually, trial. Moreover, there will be expenses associated with that process. CP is certainly prepared to assist in minimizing both the cost and inconvenience by attending upon witnesses in their own jurisdictions for questioning, as may be reasonable.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>137. The parties to this claim are located in Alberta (CP and Altus), Saskatchewan (KPCL and Clifton), British Columbia (Thurber) and Ontario (Hatch).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact has, for the purpose of this application, filed an Affidavit from an individual in Alberta, but is a federally regulated corporation. See Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>138. It would be inconvenient for Clifton and KPCL to have this claim proceed in Alberta, and it would be equally inconvenient for CP and Altus to litigate in Saskatchewan, rendering this a neutral factor.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>Records</UNDER></TI>
<P>139. In terms of the available evidence, it is only to be expected that many of the records regarding the Belle Plaine Project will be electronically accessible from virtually any jurisdiction, including Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 30, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 5-6, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>140. That said, physical records also exist regarding the parties work on the Belle Plaine Project. While some of the defendants have their physical records for the Belle Plaine Project in Saskatchewan, Hatch, which provided the primary engineering services for the design of the Belle Plaine Project, has physical records mostly located in Alberta, with <UNDER>none</UNDER> in Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 3&mdash;4, Exhibit 2 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>141. Regardless of where this Action proceeds, witnesses and parties will be inconvenienced. Expenses will be incurred. There is no basis upon which to assume that travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta is more expensive or inconvenient than travel in the other direction, and the parties, witnesses and records are balanced as between Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Cost of Transfer</UNDER></TI>
<P>142. At this stage, there would be little cost associated with a transfer of either the Saskatchewan Actions to Alberta or with transferring this Action to Saskatchewan, recognizing that two defendants have already defended the Alberta action and they may have issues with being somehow forced into Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(e)</N><TI>Comparative Convenience/Expense</TI>
<P>143. However, the comparative convenience of proceeding in Alberta as opposed to Saskatchewan cannot be considered without reference to the forum selection clauses that apply to Hatch and Clifton, as outlined above. As explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd. v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>it must be the rare case where [balance of convenience and expense] alone is so overwhelming as to be determinative if all other considerations are largely neutral or would dictate that the parties' agreement be upheld. That must be particularly so when, as here, the choice is between two common law jurisdictions in this country. A party who resides or carries on business in British Columbia but who agrees to litigate disputes in the courts of another province must be taken to have accepted at the time the agreement was made that there could be a significant measure of inconvenience and expense associated with geographical distances. That party should not then, without more, be easily relieved of the contractual obligation it agreed to bear.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1996] BCJ No. 2148</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 29</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>144. If only the locations of the likely witnesses, the parties and the records regarding this claim were taken into account, the assessment of comparative convenience weighs slightly in favour of Alberta. However, once the jurisdiction clauses are also considered, as they must be, it is clear that neither Hatch nor Clifton ought to be relieved of any additional inconvenience or expense associated with the contractual agreements they accepted. As a result, on the whole, this factor weighs strongly in favour of Alberta's jurisdiction over this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Law to be Applied</UNDER></TI>
<P>145. The law to be applied to the claims in breach of contract as against Hatch and Clifton is unquestionably the law of Alberta, which is also applicable to the claim of negligent misrepresentation against Clifton and claims in relation to the Thurber Contract. There is, moreover, no reason that if an Alberta court was required to apply Saskatchewan law it could not do so, even in respect of claims requiring interpretation of Saskatchewan legislation such as <EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, which CP says has no application in any event in the within matters.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kerr Interior Systems Ltd v Kenroc Building and Materials Co Ltd</SOC><CITE>2009 ABCA 240</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 30</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, SS 1984-85-86, c B-7.1, [<BOLD><EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 31</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>146. While the law of Saskatchewan may apply to some of CP's claims in tort depending on how the Court construes the place where the tort occurred, and potentially to CP's claims in contract as against KPCL and Intact, Alberta courts could apply that law without issue, which would be no different than the Saskatchewan courts being called upon to apply Alberta law in accordance with the choice of law provisions if this Action were to be transferred to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>147. In either event, the general law of contract and tort are essentially the same in both places, rendering this a neutral factor.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Yara Belle Plaine Inc v Ingersoll-Rand Company et al</SOC><CITE>2014 SKQB 254</CITE><PARANUM>76</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 32</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>148. This factor is neutral, as a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts would be recognized in the other jurisdiction. Enforcement will be facilitated by the <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c R-6 and <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSS 1978, c R-3.

<BLOCK4><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Avoiding Multiplicity of Legal Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>149. Rule 1.2(2) of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> highlights the importance of efficiency in Court proceedings, a goal that is even more important in view of the scarcity of judicial resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Generally, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is more efficient in terms of the proceedings themselves and in the use of judicial resources.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 1.2(2)</P1></P>
<P>150. In this case, KPCL itself has, it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions by filing the Originating Application in the face of its own Saskatchewan Action, seeking through both claims further payments in respect of KPCL's work on the Belle Plaine Project and corresponding determinations of KPCL's alleged rights under the KPCL Contract, all of which are raised squarely in this Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>151. It is questionable whether KPCL's second action was commenced genuinely or reflects an effort to bootstrap the current jurisdiction motion. KPCL, if it was looking for efficiency or cost-effectiveness or to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, could equally have simply added its claim in respect of holdback funds under the KPCL Contract to the KPCL Saskatchewan Action or, of course, to the present claim.</P>
<P>152. In addition to <UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity, the substance of the KPCL Originating Application is also questionable. No lien can arise in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, which constitutes a federal undertaking.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Co v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 35</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>153. In the absence of a lien, KPCL is not a &ldquo;lien claimant&rdquo;, as defined within the Builders' Lien Act, and so is not entitled to the remedies available to lien claimants thereunder. Moreover, it is not a trustee or the beneficiary of a trust within the meaning of the Builders' Lien Act. As a result, the remedies KPCL seeks in the KPCL Originating Application are simply unavailable to it, which again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action for such in Saskatchewan, given its jurisdictional challenge was, in February of this year, set for hearing in early July.
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at ss 6(2), 17(1)(a), 38(6) and (7)</P1></P>
<P>154. In addition to having launched multiple actions regarding essentially the same subject matter, which in the usual course would amount to an abuse of process, KPCL has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications in different provinces, with its principal noting that he &ldquo;would like the Saskatchewan court to have the opportunity to address whether it will exercise jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, para 35, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> despite the fact that KPCL is in the process of having this Honourable Court consider the very same question.</P>
<P>155. Multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided. That is axiomatic. This basic principle, which reflects the inherent interest in efficiency, is embedded not only in the <EM>Rules</EM> but also in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2 (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). As confirmed in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, as a corollary to the principle that multiple proceedings regarding the same issues should be avoided, another of the Court's objectives is to ensure that all issues in controversy between the parties are determined as completely and finally as possible. This is the case in every province.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, ss 5(3)(f) and 8, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 36</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>156. In these circumstances, the twin objectives of avoiding multiple proceedings and allowing all issues to be determined as completely and finally as possible militates in favour of allowing this Action to proceed in Alberta, where all of the likely parties to the claim are already parties to the Action, four of the defendants have consented to the Court's jurisdiction, and the remaining two are not only defendants to CP's Statement of Claim but also respondents to a Notice to Co-defendants.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Efficiency</UNDER></TI>
<P>157. CP wasted no time in proceeding with its claim in Alberta. KPCL, in contrast, waited 5 months to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, to which it now points as a parallel proceeding warranting transfer of the within Action to Saskatchewan, until CP's Action had been filed and served, and even then served the KPCL Saskatchewan Action only two days before KPCL's defence was due in this Action. KPCL then served a further proceeding against CP by way of Originating Application, which overlaps significantly with the issues in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and this claim.</P>
<P>158. This Action has, from the outset, included Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact as Defendants. KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, is against only CP. To bring this Action within the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, CP would have to initiate a Counterclaim against KPCL and claim against Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, Altus and Intact as parties, but this is already underway in this Action.</P>
<P>159. Then, of course, the question will arise about the propriety of dragging Altus and Thurber to Saskatchewan, when they have defended in Alberta. On the other hand, if the Action proceeds in Alberta, the issues will all be addressed, against all relevant parties, in one Action</P>
<P>160. Allowing this Action to proceed will also allow determination of the issues in the Saskatchewan Actions, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplicative proceedings. The issues are, in substance, the same, as they relate to issues arising from the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. KPCL should not be rewarded for having waited to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action or for filing a further duplicative claim by being allowed to rely on the Saskatchewan Actions as reason to transfer this Action out of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>161. While CP recognizes that juridical advantage is of less weight in assessing jurisdiction as between provinces than in an international context, in this instance proceedings in Alberta, CP's chosen forum, offer two juridical benefits. There is no basis upon which to deprive CP of either.</P>
<P>162. One is a benefit to all parties in the context of this litigation. Under the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, there is no formal limit to the number of corporate witnesses who may be questioned. In contrast, under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, parties are entitled to question only one representative of a corporation in the absence of a Court Order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., filed March 29, 2018, para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While CP expects that this would be addressed by agreement amongst counsel, given the complex and highly technical nature of the subject matter of this claim, it is important to ensure that fulsome questioning is available.</P>
<P>163. Further, if this Action is stayed or set aside, the defendants may attempt to argue that CP is barred from proceeding with an action in Saskatchewan by virtue of <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, which may be the actual motivation behind KPCL's multiplicity of actions and applications. In contrast, there is no question that CP's Statement of Claim in this Action was filed and served within the appropriate time. It would, to put it mildly, be a significant loss of the juridical advantage of proceeding in Alberta if CP were to find itself time barred in an alternate forum.</P>
<P>164. If this Court determines that CP's choice of forum and the submission to jurisdiction of Thurber and Altus should be disregarded, and concludes that the jurisdictional provisions in the contracts between CP and Hatch and CP and Clifton need not be honoured, any resulting transfer of this Action should be undertaken pursuant to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Attornment to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>165. Taking steps to contest the substantive merits of a claim is the principal hallmark of attornment. Filing an application to object to the jurisdiction of the forum is not attornment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Manson v Canada (Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 212</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 37</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>166. The suggestion that this Action be stayed or set aside in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan appears to ignore the fact that a portion of CP's claim will remain within the jurisdiction. CP's Statement of Claim against Thurber and Altus is separate and apart from the Jurisdiction Applications. These claims, as well as any claims arising under the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, will need to be addressed in any event.</P>
<P>167. CP intentionally has not, to this point, taken any steps to contest the merits of either of the Saskatchewan Actions. Rather, CP has sought only to address initial matters preliminary to potential applications in respect of jurisdiction. This does not constitute attornment.</P>
<P>168. In <CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC></CASEREF>, the defendant brought a motion to stay the Plaintiff's action in Ontario, and submitted that Quebec was the more appropriate forum for the action. The plaintiff filed his action in Ontario, then the defendant brought a parallel action in Quebec. After both actions had commenced, the plaintiff brought a motion for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief. That relief was granted. In the course of granting a stay of the Ontario action, the Court explained that:
<QUOTE><P>the defendant has not attorned to the Ontario Court's jurisdiction but <UNDER>was required to respond to the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief</UNDER> because the plaintiff refused the defendant's request for an adjournment of the plaintiff's motion and to permit her first to bring a motion to contest the forum. As such, <UNDER>the defendant came before [the justice hearing the injunction motion] under duress</UNDER>, after clearly signalling her intention to contest jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>169. Similarly, in this case CP was required to respond to KPCL's Originating Application, as KPCL had amply demonstrated its unwillingness to adjourn pending the hearing of its existing Jurisdiction Application. CP has, from its first interactions with KPCL, signalled its intention to contest jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and has taken no steps to contest the merits of either matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>Go to the end of this document to see what else you can do and when you must do it.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Remedy claimed or sought:</TI>
<P><P1>1. An Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of the Plaintiff, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;) as against the Defendant Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;) for want of jurisdiction.</P1>
<P1>2. Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying this Action in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan.</P1>
<P1>3. An Order, if necessary, abridging the time for service of this Application and supporting Affidavit.</P1>
<P1>4. Costs of this Application on a solicitor and own client, full indemnity, basis, or such other basis as this Honourable Court may allow, in favour of Hatch.</P1>
<P1>5. Such further and other relief as Hatch may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Grounds for making this Application:</TI>
<P><P1>6. Hatch supports the applications of its Co-Defendants, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;) and Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;), filed on February 8, 2018 and February 23, 2018, respectively, to set aside the Statement of Claim filed by CP for want of jurisdiction or to stay this Action on the basis that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. To the extent that the grounds raised by KPCL or Clifton ar applicable, Hatch restates and relies upon them in making this Application.</P1>
<P1>7. There is no real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which the claims made in CP's Statement of Claim are based, including in particular those claims against Hatch.</P1>
<P1>8. While the Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch (the &ldquo;Master Agreement&rdquo;) contains a &lsquo;forum selection&rsquo; provision (the &ldquo;Forum Selection Clause&rdquo;), such provision explicitly identifies that the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts is nonexclusive.</P1>
<P1>9. Further, or in the alternative, the Foum Selection Clause is invalid, unclear, and unenforceable. Furthermore, the Forum Selection Clause does not apply to any cause of action unrelated to the interpretation and alleged breach of the Master Agreement.</P1>
<P1>10. In the event that the Forum Selection Clause is found to be valid, clear, enforceable, and applicable to some or all of CP's claims against Hatch, which is not admitted but expressly denied, Hatch states that there is strong cause not to enforce the Forum Selection Clause because:
<P2>a. The Master Agreement was drafted by CP without an ability or opportunity for Hatch to negotiate the Forum Selection Clause;</P2>
<P2>b. Not all of the current or potential parties to this Action are bound by similar forum selection clauses in favour of Alberta; and</P2>
<P2>c. KPCL has commenced an action against CP in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench related to the same construction project, in which it is expected Hatch will be involved as a witness or otherwise.</P2></P1>
<P1>11. Further, or in the alternative, if the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction over the Action or Hatch, which is denied, Alberta is not an appropriate or convenient, or the clearly most appropriate or convenient, forum for the adjudication of the disputes raised in or related to the matters raised in this Action; Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P1>
<P1>12. Saskatchewan is the most appropriate and convenient, or the clearly most appropriate and convenient, forum for the adjudication of the disputes raised in or related to the matters raised in this Action; Saskatchewan is the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>.</P1>
<P1>13. It is fair, just, efficient and convenient for this Action to be stayed in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan.</P1>
<P1>14. Hatch has not filed a Statement of Defence in this matter or otherwise attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts.</P1>
<P1>15. Such further and other grounds as counsel for Hatch may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Material or evidence to be relied on:</TI>
<P><P1>16. The pleadings and proceedings filed in this Action;</P1>
<P1>17. The Affidavit of Andrew Paton, sworn March 29, 2018, filed;</P1>
<P1>18. The Affidavit of Kely Panteluk, filed February 8, 2018;</P1>
<P1>19. The Affidavit of Wayne Clifton, to be filed;</P1>
<P1>20. Any other Affidavits filed in this Action; and</P1>
<P1>21. Such further and other material as counsel for Hatch may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Applicable Rules:</TI>
<P><P1>22. Rules 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 3.30, 3.68, 6.2, 6.3, 10.29, 10.31, 11.25, 11.31 and 13.5 of the Alberta <EM>Rules of Court</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Applicable Acts and Regulations:</TI>
<P><P1>23. <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> (AR 124/2010) and amendments thereto.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Any irregularity complained of or objection relied on:</TI>
<P><P1>24. Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> with respect to the within Action.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>25.</BOLD> Hatch brings this Application expressly without attorning to the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>How the Application is proposed to be heard or considered:</TI>
<P><P1>26. In person with one, some, or all parties or their counsel present.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>WARNING</TI>
<P>If you do not come to Court either in person or by your lawyer, the Court may give the applicant what they want in your absence. You will be bound by any order that the Court makes.</P>
<P>If you want to take part in this application, you or your lawyer must attend Court on the date and at the time shown at the beginning of the form. If you intend to rely on an affidavit or other evidence when the application is heard or considered, you must reply by giving reasonable notice of the material to the applicant.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF WAYNE CLIFTON Sworn (or Affirmed) on June 15, 2018</TI>
<P>I, WAYNE CLIFTON, of Regina, Saskatchewan, SWEAR/AFFIRM AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<EM>Clifton</EM>&rdquo;). I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein, except where stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated I believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. This Affidavit is supplemental to my Affidavit sworn on March 29, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>March Clifton Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms in this Affidavit have the same meaning ascribed in the March Clifton Affidavit.</P>
<P>3. The purpose of this Affidavit is to correct a mistake in paragraph 15 of the March Clifton Affidavit. Paragraph 15 of my Affidavit sworn on March 29, 2018 states that the Clifton Agreement was executed by Justin Meyer of CP in Calgary on April 15, 2018 and was then emailed to me. Upon further review of my records, I have determined that I executed the Clifton Agreement on behalf of Clifton on April 16, 2015. The Clifton Agreement had not yet been executed by CP when I executed it. It appears from the fully executed version of the Clifton Agreement in Clifton's files that Justin Meyer of CP executed the Clifton Agreement on April 30, 2015.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF ANDREW PATON Sworn (or Affirmed) on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> day of March, 2018</TI>
<P>I, Andrew Paton, of the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, SWEAR AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a Project Manager of the Defendant, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;), and as such have knowledge of the contents hereinafter deposed to, save where based upon information and belief, and where so based, I do verily believe same to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have reviewed the Statement of Claim filed in this Action, which was filed on December 1, 2017.</P>
<P>3. This Action relates to the construction of a 30.4 km. railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo; located near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;), a village between Regina and Moose Jaw. The purpose of the Project was to connect Canadian Pacific Railway Company's (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;) main rail line to a potash mine owned by K+S Potash Canada General Partnership.</P>
<P>4. As part of the Project an embankment was constructed on the either side of the Qu'Appelle River in Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Embankment&rdquo;). On or about December 5, 2015, the Embankment began to fail during construction and ultimately almost a full kilometer of construction works were affected (the &ldquo;Embankment Foundation Failure&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. I have been personally involved in the Project on behalf of Hatch since 2014, and was Hatch's Project Manager on the Project at the time the Embankment Foundation Failure occurred.</P>
<P>6. As a result of the foregoing, I have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, except where stated to be based upon information and belief, and where so stated I do verily believe the same to be true. I am authorized to swear this Affidavit on behalf of Hatch.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Agreement for Hatch to Provide Services on the Project</TI>
<P>7. Hatch, formerly known as Hatch Mott MacDonald Ltd., is an engineering company that provides engineering, project and construction, business consulting and operational services to clients across Canada.</P>
<P>8. Hatch is the Canadian subsidiary of Hatch Associates Inc., an American corporation. Hatch is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of an Alberta corporate registry search of Hatch.</P>
<P>9. Hatch's head office is located in Ontario, with satellite offices across Canada including Regina and Saskatoon.</P>
<P>10. On or about January 1, 2012 CP and Hatch entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;Master Agreement&rdquo;) whereby Hatch would be available to provide professional engineering consulting services to CP as required by CP. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit is a true copy of the Master Agreement.</P>
<P>11. The Master Agreement was subsequently amended in writing on February 17, 2014 and December 5, 2014. True copies of those amendments are attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>Exhibit&rdquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit.</P>
<P>12. In or about August, 2012, Hatch prepared a proposal for the Project (the &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;). The Proposal was subsequently updated on or about November 29, 2013. A true copy of the November 29, 2013 update is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit.</P>
<P>13. Subsequent to the Proposal being issued, CP and Hatch engaged in conversation and correspondence to modify certain terms of the Proposal. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit is correspondence between CP and Hatch, dated December 12, 2013 and January 8, 2014.</P>
<P>14. On January 21, 2014 the Proposal was accepted by CP on the terms set out in the Master Agreement. A true copy of the award letter is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit.</P>
<P>15. Upon review of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk, filed in this action, I understand and do verily believe, all discussions about the Proposal and the agreement for Hatch to perform work on the Project were with Mr. Glenn Whitham of CP's Strategic Sourcing Group. Mr. Whitham worked out of CP's Mississauga, Ontario office.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Performance of Work on the Project</TI>
<P>16. While the initial design work performed by Hatch in respect of the Project was primarily done through Hatch's Calgary office, I would attend the Project site in Saskatchewan to view construction progress.</P>
<P>17. At all times the physical Project site was located entirely within Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>18. Construction on the Project commenced in the Spring of 2015.</P>
<P>19. At the beginning of the construction phase CP and Hatch entered into a Work Order Proposal setting out Hatch's scope of work during the construction phase. A true copy of that Work Order Proposal is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit.</P>
<P>20. When face-to-face meetings relating to the Project occurred between the parties involved in this litigation, they would generally be held in Saskatchewan, either at the Regina offices of Clifton Associates Ltd. or at the Project site.</P>
<P>21. Due to the number of parties involved, and their various locations, often meetings would often be held by way of teleconference, headquartered through Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>22. When a meeting required the attendance of participation of a Hatch representative in Saskatchewan, I would be that representative.</P>
<P>23. In respect of the work being performed by the various parties, I understood their scopes of work included the following:
<P1>(a) Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;) was the general contractor responsible for the actual construction on the Project;</P1>
<P1>(b) Clifton Associates. Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;) managed and monitored the Project, directing the work performed by KPCL and performing quality control. Clifton was also the geotechnical engineer of record as of April, 2015, having replaced Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;Thurber&rdquo;). Once Clifton replaced Thurber, Clifton provided geotechnical recommendations for embankment design, undertook additional geotechnical investigations and were responsible for geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring during construction;</P1>
<P1>(c) Thurber Engineering Ltd. acted as geotechnical consultant for the Project until approximately April, 2015; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership performed surveying services for the Project.</P1></P>
<P>24. I have reviewed the lists of individuals involved in the Project that are described in the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk. Based on my involvement with the Project, and to the best of my recollection and knowledge, I believe:
<P1>(a) That the names, roles, and locations of those individuals involved in the Project on behalf of CP as described at paragraphs 19, 44, and 46 of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 are accurate, with the following exceptions:
<P2>(i) I have no knowledge of the role or location of Martin Quintel.</P2>
<P2>(ii) I am not aware of Justin Meyer's role as a replacement for Chris Bunce.</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) That the names, roles, and locations of those individuals involved in the Project on behalf of Clifton Associates Ltd. as described at paragraphs 53 to 55 of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 are accurate, with the following exceptions:
<P2>(i) I have no knowledge of roles and locations of Kyle Mason or Heather Duncan.</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) That the names, roles, and locations of those individuals involved in the Project on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership as described at paragraphs 67 to 69 of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 are accurate, with the following exceptions:
<P2>(i) I am not aware of roles or locations of Aaron Bitterman and Dave Gurnsey; and</P2></P1>
<P1>(d) That the list of key witnesses and their locations as described at paragraph 78 of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 is accurate, with the following exceptions:
<P2>(i) I have no knowledge of the individuals listed other than Kelly Panteluk, Scott Mason, Riley Panteluk and Evan Powel.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Appropriate Forum</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Subject Matter of the Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. The Project to which this Action relates is the construction of a railway spur located in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Location of the Parties, Witnesses and Evidence</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. As mentioned above, I do verily believe that the list of key witnesses and their location set out at paragraph 78 of the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 is accurate. The vast majority of those witnesses do not reside in Alberta.</P>
<P>27. In addition to the witnesses of the parties identified in the Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018, I have had correspondence with Kelly McGarry and Barry Singer, fellow Hatch employees, and have been advised by counsel for Hatch, Mr. Shane B. King, of McLeod Law LLP, and do verily believe that it will also be necessary to call witnesses from the Saskatchewan and Canadian governmental and regulatory bodies to provide evidence on the regulatory requirements and standards prescribed for work performed within the Province of Saskatchewan, and on the project itself. These would include, but are not limited to, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Transport Canada, the Canadian Transportation Agency, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and the Highway Traffic Board, all of whom would have local representatives, out of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>28. The Project site where construction took place and the Embankment Foundation Failure occurred is located entirely within Saskatchewan. I would expect that any physical evidence relating to the Embankment Foundation Failure or its causes would be located at the Project site.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Other Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. I have been advised by counsel for Hatch, Shane B. King of McLeod Law LLP, and do verily believe, that on or about August 28, 2017, KPCL commenced an action in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench against CP seeking damages for work performed on the Project by KPCL.</P>
<P>30. I am advised by counsel for Hatch, Shane B. King of McLeod Law LLP, and do verily believe, that counsel for KPCL has advised that they expect to call representatives of Hatch as witnesses in the Saskatchewan proceedings commenced by KPCL.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Convenience and Location of Parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>31. Save for the Plaintiff, to my knowledge none of the parties to this Action are incorporated under the laws of Alberta or have a head office in Alberta.</P>
<P>32. All of the parties involved in this Action are either based in, or have offices in, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>33. I can advise that employees of the Calgary office of Hatch, including myself, travel to the Saskatchewan offices for various projects. Travel to Saskatchewan to attend questioning for discovery or give evidence at trial would be a relatively minor inconvenience to the employees of Hatch who may be called as witnesses in this matter.</P>
<P>34. I swear this Affidavit in support of an application seeking that the Statement of Claim of CP be set aside as against Hatch for want of jurisdiction or, alternatively, a declaration that Alberta is a <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an Order staying the Action in its entirety against Hatch, and for no improper purpose</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;Hatch&rdquo;) seeks to set aside the Statement of Claim of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;) in this action (the &ldquo;Action&rdquo;) for want of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, seeks a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> (the &ldquo;Application&rdquo;). Three of the other Defendants in this Action, Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;KPCL&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;Clifton&rdquo;) and Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;Intact&rdquo;) have filed similar applications challenging this Honourable Court's jurisdiction and asserting Alberta is not the appropriate forum for this Action. Hatch supports those applications, and relies upon their respective pleadings, as applicable.</P>
<P>2. Due to expected and anticipated significant overlap between these Applications, this Brief on behalf of Hatch will focus on unique and particular facts as related to Hatch, and will not repeat anticipated and expected arguments from co-Applicants, but will rely upon same in argument at the Application itself.</P>
<P>3. The main connection to Alberta is the corporate office of the Plaintiff, CP. The majority of witnesses and parties are from Saskatchewan, and most importantly, the construction itself took place in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>4. Hatch respectfullysubmits CP has not established this Honourable Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>. In the alternative, if CP is able to do so, it is respectfully submitted this Honourable Court ought to stay this Action in favour of the Courts of Saskatchewan on the grounds the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The Project</TI>
<P>5. This Action relates to the construction of a 30.4 kilometres railway spur, known as the &ldquo;Belle Plaine Railway Spur&rdquo; located near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;), a village between Regina and Moose Jaw. The purpose of the Project was to connect CP's main rail line to a potash mine owned by K+S Potash Canada General Partnership.</P>
<P>6. As part of the Project, an embankment was constructed on either side of the Qu'Appelle River in Saskatchewan (the &ldquo;Embankment&rdquo;). On or about December 5, 2015, the foundation of the Embankment began to fail during construction and ultimately almost a full kilometre of construction works were affected (the &ldquo;Embankment Foundation Failure&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. In this Action, CP is seeking damages and costs it alleges it suffered as a result of various alleged breaches of contract, negligence or misrepresentations relating to the Project. The Defendants KPCL, Hatch, Clifton, Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;Thurber&rdquo;) and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;Altus&rdquo;) are contractors or subcontractors retained with respect to some portion of the Project. Intact is an insurance company that provided a Performance Bond and a Labour and Material Payment Bond with respect to the Project.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Parties</TI>
<P>8. CP is a publicly-owned railway company, incorporated pursuant to the laws of Canada, and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta and Saskatchewan. CP carries on business across Canada as a provider of rail transportation services and has offices across Canada, including in Saskatchewan. CP is the owner of the Project.</P>
<P>9. Hatch, formerly known as Hatch Mott MacDonald Ltd., is an engineering company which provides engineering, project and construction, business consulting and operational services to clients across Canada, and is the Canadian subsidiary of Hatch Associates Inc., an American corporation. Hatch is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario, where its head office is located, and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta, with satellite offices across Canada, including Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
<P1>[Affidavit of A. Paton, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;]</P1></P>
<P>10. On or about January 1, 2012, CP and Hatch entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;Hatch Master Agreement&rdquo;) whereby Hatch would be available to provide professional engineering consulting services to CP as required by CP. The Master Agreement was subsequently amended in writing on February 17, 2014 and December 5, 2014.</P>
<P>11. The Hatch Master Agreement contains, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following <BOLD><UNDER>non-exclusive</UNDER></BOLD> provision:
<QUOTE><P>25. <BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the <BOLD><UNDER>non-exclusive jurisdiction</UNDER></BOLD> of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
(the &ldquo;Hatch Forum Selection Clause&rdquo;).
<P1>[Affidavit of A. Paton, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;]</P1></P>
<P>12. KPCL is a private corporation, incorporated pursuant to the laws of Saskatchewan, with its registered office in Estevan, Saskatchewan, and is in the business of providing excavation services. KPCL's construction work on the Project was done pursuant to a supply and services agreement with CP executed May 21, 2015 and dated effective March 12, 2015 (the &ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;). The KPCL Contract does not contain a jurisdiction or forum clause.</P>
<P>13. Clifton is a federal corporation, incorporated pursuant to the laws of Canada, with its registered office in Regina, Saskatchewan, with offices in Regina, Saskatoon, North Battleford, Lloydminster, Calgary and Edmonton. Clifton performed geotechnical-related work on the Project pursuant to a Supply and Services Agreement dated April 8, 2015 (the &ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;).</P>
<P>14. Intact is an insurance company and surety, which provided certain bonds on the Project, executed by a broker, Marsh Canada Limited, out of its offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>15. Thurber is a corporation, duly incorporated pursuant to the laws of British Columbia, with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia. Thurber has offices across Canada, including in Saskatoon, and provided geotechnical work to CP.</P>
<P>16. Altus is a limited partnership, registered in Alberta, with a registered office in Edmonton, Alberta, and provided monitoring work on the Project.</P>
<P>17. While the initial design work performed by Hatch in respect of the Project was primarily done through Hatch's Calgary office, the actual construction of the Project, which commenced in Spring, 2015, and overseeing of same, took place at the Project site in Saskatchewan to view construction progress.
<P1>[Affidavit of A. Paton]</P1></P>
<P>18. There are other proceedings relating to the Project that are currently underway in Saskatchewan. On August 28, 2017, KPCL filed a Statement of Claim against CP in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench (the &ldquo;Saskatchewan Action&rdquo;) and on March 5, 2018 filed a separate Originating Application in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench relating to CP's refusal to pay out a holdback to KPCL relating to the Project (the &ldquo;KPCL Holdback Application&rdquo;).</P>
<P>19. On or around December 5, 2015, there was a failure of the foundation on the Project (the &ldquo;Foundation Failure&rdquo;), which occurred in Saskatchewan. Prior to the Foundation Failure, Hatch was no longer involved in the day to day operations of the Project, having been replaced by Clifton in or about April, 2015, once Clifton replaced Thurber.</P>
<P>20. Hatch has had no involvement with the Project since the Foundation Failure.</P>
<P>21. KPCL's Saskatchewan Claim relates to damages allegedly suffered by KPCL as a result of work it performed on the Project after the Embankment Foundation Failure occurred.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. ISSUES</TI>
<P>22. Hatch respectfully submits the issues to be determined are as follows:
<P1>1. Does the non-exclusive Hatch Forum Selection Clause apply?</P1>
<P1>2. Does the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the causes of action alleged?</P1>
<P1>3. If so, should the non-exclusive Hatch Forum Selection Clause be enforced, or is the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. BRIEF ANSWER</TI>
<P>23. Hatch respectfully submits the Hatch Forum Selection Clause does not apply, and this Honourable Court is not the <EM>forum conveniens</EM>, and this Action is more appropriately heard in the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>24. In all of the circumstances, CP has not established this Honourable Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, and, in the alternative, if it has, this Court ought to stay the Action in favour of Saskatchewan on grounds of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>25. The Hatch Forum Selection Clause pertains to the <BOLD><UNDER>interpretation</UNDER></BOLD> of the Hatch Master Services Agreement, but does not refer to the services performed by Hatch. Again, for ease of reference:
<QUOTE><P>25. <BOLD>Governing Law: <UNDER>This Agreement shall be</UNDER></BOLD> governed and <BOLD><UNDER>interpreted</UNDER></BOLD> in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CPR to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. As the Hatch Master Services Agreement was drafted and prepared by CP, the onus is on CP to ensure all items it wished to include, were in fact included in same. As it did not include a forum selection clause for the actual performance of the services, it cannot now suggest same is required. There is an Entire Agreement clause within the Hatch Master Services Agreement, at clause 29 therein.
<P1>[Affidavit of A. Paton, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;]</P1></P>
<P>27. While Hatch submits this is not ambiguous, in the alternative, if the Hatch Forum Selection Clause is ambiguous, it should be interpreted against Hatch, under the doctrine of <EM>contra proferentum</EM>. Had CP wished for the services performed by Hatch to be subject to the Hatch Forum Selection Clause, it should have inserted same. The Hatch Forum Selection Clause solely governs the <BOLD><UNDER>interpretation of the Hatch Agreement</UNDER></BOLD>, and the cause of Action alleged in this Action does not pertain to the interpretation of the Hatch Agreement. Thus, it is respectfully submitted by Hatch the Hatch Forum Selection Clause does not apply to this Action.
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 1:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Limited v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Company</SOC><CITE>[1980] 1 SCR 888</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. For CP to have ensured the Alberta Courts governed <BOLD><UNDER>all</UNDER></BOLD> aspects between the parties, it should have said so. A statement as follows might have been sufficient:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement, <UNDER><EM>and the provision of services hereunder, and any disputes relating thereto</EM>,</UNDER> shall be governed by the courts of the Province of Alberta.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. Of course, as we are aware, CP did not do so, thus, Hatch should not be bound by something which CP did not include in the Agreement. This is distinguishable from the clause as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Zi Corporation v. Steinberg</SOC></CASEREF>, wherein Wittmann C.J. held that the phrase &ldquo;any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement&rdquo; was sufficient to encapture all manners of disputes. The similar analysis here should follow that failing to use such phrasing is insufficient to force the forum to be Alberta.
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 2:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Zi Corporation v. Steinberg</SOC><CITE>2006 ABQB 92</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. If the Hatch Forum Selection Clause does not apply, does the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench have jurisdiction over this Claim?</P>
<P>31. In order to establish jurisdiction, there needs to be a &ldquo;real and substantial connection&rdquo; to the jurisdiction suggested, by satisfying the list of presumptive connecting factors, as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>To recap, in a case concerning a tort, the following factors are presumptive connecting factors that, <EM>prima facie</EM>, entitle a court to assume jurisdiction over a dispute:</P>
<P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 3:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</SOC><CITE>[2012] 1 S.C.R.</CITE><PARANUM>90</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>]</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>(a)</N><TI>Is Hatch Domiciled in Alberta?</TI>
<P>32. Hatch is domiciled in Ontario, with its head office located in Mississauga. Hatch is extra-provincially registered in Alberta. All Directors are located in Mississauga, while its voting shareholder is located in Delaware. The location of a Calgary office may make this a weak connection, at best, but the bulk herein establishes Hatch as not being domiciled in Alberta, thus this connection is not met.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(b)</N><TI>Does Hatch Carry on Business in Alberta?</TI>
<P>33. It is acknowledged Hatch carries on business in Alberta, although the subject matter is not related to Alberta. This is not a strong connecting factor to Alberta, and can be rebutted by the fact the subject matter is not related to Alberta, but is related to Saskatchewan.
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 3: <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 96]</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(c)</N><TI>Was the Alleged Tort Committed in Alberta?</TI>
<P>34. This is unequivocally no. The Embankment Foundation Failure supporting any cause of action occurred in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. This is a strong factor against a connection to Alberta.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(d)</N><TI>Was the Contract Made in Alberta?</TI>
<P>35. There is simply no evidence the Hatch Master Agreement was made in Alberta, thus there is no connecting factor to Alberta.</P>
<P>36. Based upon the above, the <BOLD><UNDER>only</UNDER></BOLD> connecting factor is that Hatch does carry on business in Alberta. That is it. This can be rebutted by the fact the cause of action is not connected to the business performed in Alberta. As such, it is respectfully submitted there is no presumptive connection to Alberta.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></TI>
<P>37. Hatch respectfully submits Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.</P>
<P>38. It is acknowledged the burden is on Hatch to show why this Honourable Court should displace the forum chosen by the Plaintiff, and, in this instance, why Saskatchewan should be the proper forum.
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 3: <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 103]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. From the outset, it is indisputable that the issue complained of by CP, and that which brings about the cause of action itself, is the Embankment Foundation Failure, which took place in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. Thus the Courts of Saskatchewan have territorial competence to hear such an action, as is required pursuant to Section 9 of the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> of Saskatchewan.
<QUOTE><SEC><N>9.</N><SECP>Without limiting the right of the plaintiff to prove other circumstances that constitute a real and substantial connection between Saskatchewan and the facts on which a proceeding is based, a real and substantial connection between Saskatchewan and those facts is presumed to exist if the proceeding: &ellipsis;
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>concerns contractual obligations and:
<SPARA><N>(i)</N><SPARAP>the contractual obligations were to be performed, to a substantial extent, in Saskatchewan; &ellipsis;</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(g)</N><PARAP>is brought for a tort committed in Saskatchewan...</PARAP></PARA></SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 4: <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997, c. C-41.1, at para. 9]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>40. Once this is established, the onus is on Hatch and the other co-Applicants to establish why Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and why this matter is best heard in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>41. Again, from <EM>Van Breda</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>A party applying for a stay on the basis of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> may raise diverse facts, considerations and concerns. Despite some legislative attempts to draw up exhaustive lists, I doubt that it will ever be possible to do so.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>As I mentioned above, the factors that a Court may consider in deciding whether to apply <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> may vary depending upon:</P>
<P>(a) the location of the parties;</P>
<P>(b) the location of the witnesses;</P>
<P>(c) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P>
<P>(d) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P>
<P>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P>
<P>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 3: <EM>Van Breda</EM>, at paras. 103 and 110]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>42. Hatch will address each of these, in turn.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>(a)</N><TI><UNDER>The location of the parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>43. In reviewing the respective Affidavits, all of the parties operate in Saskatchewan, two of the parties, being KPCL and Intact, are incorporated in Saskatchewan, and two of the parties have their head offices in Saskatchewan. Only Altus is an Alberta based partnership, with its head office also in Alberta. This factor is thus in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(b)</N><TI><UNDER>The location of the witnesses</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. There are in excess of fifty witnesses expected at this trial. Of these, pertaining to Hatch, there were ten involved in the Project. Of these ten, three are known to be in Alberta, four are known to be outside Alberta, while the location of the remaining three is unknown. Pertaining to those witnesses of Clifton and KPCL, the majority, over 92%, are from Saskatchewan. It is also expected there will be witnesses from Governmental Agencies at this trial, and as the incident occurred in Saskatchewan, those will be from Saskatchewan. There are only seven expected witnesses who are known tobe resident in Alberta. This factor is thus strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.
<P1><BOLD>[Tab 5: Response to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch]</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(c)</N><TI><UNDER>The cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay</UNDER></TI>
<P>45. There is no expected cost in the action occurring in Saskatchewan. The litigation is in its infancy, with Statements of Defense not having been filed by most parties. Affidavits of Records have not been exchanged. There will be no duplication required with the stay of this Alberta Action. Due to the location of witnesses, with the majority being in Saskatchewan, including all ten from Clifton and all but two of KPCL's anticipated seventeen witnesses, the cost to have these witnesses travel to Alberta for Questioning and trial is excessive, and strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>The impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>46. As known, KPCL has commenced an Action in Saskatchewan. There is no Application known to Hatch to have this Saskatchewan Action stayed for the Alberta Action. Should both actions be permitted, there would be multiplicity of actions, and could be different results in the two actions. This factor is strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>Problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. There are no problems with the recognition or enforcement of the judgment of a Saskatchewan judgment within Alberta, British Columbia, or Ontario, being the home jurisdictions of the Defendants, via the each provinces' respective <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>. There are thus no problems to suggest this Action should not be heard in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>The relative strengths of the connections of the parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. All parties have operations in Saskatchewan, with all but KPCL having operations also in Alberta. Again, only one party, Altus, has both its partnership registered and head office in Alberta, while federally incorporated Clifton has its head office in Saskatchewan, as does KPCL, which is also incorporated in Saskatchewan. Hatch is incorporated and has its head office in Ontario, with offices in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, while Thurber is incorporated and holds its head office in British Columbia, but does have operations in each of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Finally, federally incorporated CP has its head office in Calgary and has offices throughout Saskatchewan. When adding all of these factors together, the majority strongly favours Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>49. Other important factors are now addressed.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>Where the services were provided</UNDER></TI>
<P>50. As has been set out throughout, the action pertains to the construction of a rail spur in Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. While the initial drafting by Hatch took place in Calgary, the services were for a site in Saskatchewan, and repeated trips to Saskatchewan were required to commence, and for the fulsome performance of, the services, including site visits and finalisation of design specifications. This factor is strongly in favour of Saskatchewan.
<P1>[Affidavit of A. Paton, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;]</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Where the Alleged Tort or Breach of Contract Arose</UNDER></TI>
<P>51. This is unequivocal. The Foundation Failure took place at the site of the Project, being Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan. Of this there can be no debate. Further, it is likely experts will have to attend the site itself, to observe and gather evidence. It is possible attendance upon the site will be required during the trial. This factor is incredibly strong in favour of Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Timeliness</UNDER></TI>
<P>52. The timeliness, or lack thereof, for trial scheduling in Alberta is extremely slow. Mr. Panteluk has set out the booking dates for trials in the respective jurisdictions, being 2021 in Alberta, and 2019 in Saskatchewan. This factor thus favours Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>53. It is thus the respectful submission of Hatch, in these circumstances, taking into account all factors, this dispute should to be dealt with in Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. RELIEF REQUESTED</TI>
<P>54. Hatch respectfully seeks the following relief:
<P1>(a) An Order setting aside the Statement of Claim of thePlaintiff, CP as against the Defendant, Hatch for want of jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>(b) Further, or in the alternative, a declaration that Alberta is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> and an order staying this action in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan;</P1>
<P1>(c) Costs of this application on a Solicitor and his own client, full indemnity basis; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED THIS 15<SUP>th</SUP> DAY OF JUNE, 2018.</BOLD></P>

</TBLROW>
</TBLROWS>
</TBLBODY>
</SGMLTBL></TABLE></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. At issue in this application is whether this claim, which was appropriately filed by Canadian Pacific Railway Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>CP</BOLD>&rdquo;) in the Alberta Courts and which has a real and substantial connection to Alberta, should nonetheless be transferred to Saskatchewan to suit the interests of the single defendant formally domiciled there.</P>
<P>2. CP, a federal corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, filed the Statement of Claim in this Action on December 1, 2017. In its Statement of Claim, CP sets out causes of action against defendants spread across Canada. The claim involves allegations of breach of contract and negligence arising out of the design and construction of a rail spur near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan that forms part of CP's national rail network (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Belle Plaine Project</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP moved forward with the litigation, serving its Statement of Claim on the various defendants between January 8 and January 19, 2018.</P>
<P>3. The defendants are located across Canada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Four of the six defendants have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, with two of those having filed defences and one filing Notices to Co-defendants.</P>
<P>4. Despite this, certain of the defendants&mdash;including two who have contractually attorned&mdash;have chosen to challenge the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Jurisdiction Applications</BOLD>&rdquo;), presumably in an effort to create delay and inconvenience to CP in the handling of this Action.</P>
<P>5. There is, however, no basis upon which to set aside this claim in which two defendants have already defended and have brought no motions to challenge jurisdiction or strike the claim. There is a real and substantial connection between Alberta and the facts on which this Action is based, and the parties not resident in Alberta are necessary and proper parties to this Action</P>
<P>6. While the Belle Plaine Project was constructed in Saskatchewan, the bulk of the design and engineering work was completed in Alberta. The majority of those <UNDER>likely</UNDER> to be questioned or to appear as witnesses at trial are either in Alberta or are in jurisdictions other than Saskatchewan, with the result that comparative convenience either favours proceeding in Alberta, or is a neutral factor. The law applicable to several of the contracts at issue is the law of Alberta, where all but one of the parties to this Action carry on business and where many of the physical records regarding this claim are located.</P>
<P>7. Efficiency and fairness also favour proceeding in Alberta. All of the principal actors involved in the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project are parties to this Action, and the most reasonable means to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings is to allow this Action to proceed in the usual course. Further, given the number of individuals the parties have already identified as likely to be required for Questioning, Alberta's more robust Rules regarding Questioning are better suited to allowing the complex facts underlying this claim to be brought to light, which will assist in the assessment and potential resolution of the claims.</P>
<P>8. The fact that the Saskatchewan Courts also have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> over the subject matter of this claim does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court and, given the strong connection of the parties and the subject matter of this litigation to Alberta, Saskatchewan cannot be shown to be a clearly more appropriate forum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>9. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project was underway from 2012 to 2017. To facilitate construction, CP contracted with the defendants, Hatch Corporation (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch</BOLD>&rdquo;), Thurber Engineering Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Thurber</BOLD>&rdquo;), Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL</BOLD>&rdquo;), Clifton Associates Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Altus</BOLD>&rdquo;) to provide engineering and construction services.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the failures on the part of Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL and Altus (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendant Contractors</BOLD>&rdquo;) to engineer, design and/or construct the Belle Plaine Project properly, a significant earthwork embankment adjacent to the Qu'Appelle River collapsed (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Embankment Failure</BOLD>&rdquo;). CP was required to redesign the affected segment of the Belle Plaine Project and to reconstruct the entirety of the damaged earthworks.</P>
<P>11. CP initiated the within Action to recover the damages it suffered as a result of the Embankment Failure. CP's Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Defendant Contractors is liable to CP for breach of contract and in negligence. The Statement of Claim also alleges negligent misrepresentation as against Clifton and advances a breach of contract claim against Intact Insurance Company (&ldquo;<BOLD>Intact</BOLD>&rdquo;), which issued a performance bond in respect of KPCL's work.</P>
<P>12. CP is a federal corporation with its registered office and headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. With few exceptions, the majority of the CP personnel involved in the Belle Plaine Project were based in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk sworn February 7, 2018 (&ldquo;Panteluk Affidavit&rdquo;), paras 18 and 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Hatch was the main engineering and procurement contractor for the Belle Plaine Project. CP's allegations as against Hatch in respect of the deficiencies in Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project sound in both contract and tort.</P>
<P>14. Hatch is an Ontario corporation with its registered office in Mississauga, Ontario and is extra-provincially registered in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Andrew Paton sworn March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Paton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 8 and Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Effective January 1, 2012, CP entered into a Supply of Services Agreement with Hatch (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Hatch contracted to provide professional engineering services as required by CP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 10 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Although Hatch initially sought to have its work on the Belle Plaine Project formalized through a distinct contract between itself and CP, it subsequently <UNDER>requested</UNDER> that its work on the Belle Plaine Project be brought within the existing Hatch Contract. CP's acceptance of the Hatch proposal was expressly subject to Hatch's work on the Belle Plaine Project being undertaken pursuant to the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, Exhibits F, G and H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Hatch carries on business in Alberta, with offices in both Calgary and Edmonton,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Hatch Corporation, dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 12 to the Affidavit of Katherine McArdle sworn June 22, 2016 (&ldquo;McArdle Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and conducted the initial design work for the Belle Plaine Project at its office in Calgary, Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This was in keeping with the proposal Hatch provided for the work on the Belle Plaine Project (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hatch Proposal</BOLD>&rdquo;), which identified 11 individuals as the personnel who would be working on the design and engineering of the Belle Plaine Project, all but two of whom were in Alberta (with none in Saskatchewan).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, para 6 and Schedule A at pages 20&ndash;32, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The Hatch Contract reflects the express agreement between Hatch and CP as to the law that would govern and the forum in which disputes would be determined, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Hatch dated January 1, 2012 (&ldquo;Hatch Contract&rdquo;), section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The vast majority of the Hatch employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project, including the Project Managers, Directors and Engineers, were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only one of ten identified employees was not in Alberta as Hatch was performing its work&mdash;that individual was resident in British Columbia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Hatch's Project Manager for the Belle Plaine Project was based in Calgary throughout the period while Hatch was performing the work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, including at the time of the Embankment Failure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 5; Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. As set out in the Hatch Proposal, although Hatch was to be the &ldquo;prime consultant&rdquo; and would rely on its &ldquo;strong, multi-discipline Calgary-based team&rdquo;, Hatch also proposed retaining its &ldquo;exclusive subconsultants&rdquo;, including Thurber, to assist with work on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit at para 6 and Schedule A at page 33, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its contractual obligations to CP under the Hatch Contract, Hatch was required to ensure that any subcontractors strictly adhered to all of the terms of the Hatch Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 6 of Schedule A, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Thurber, which is a British Columbia corporation with its registered office in Victoria, British Columbia,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 61 and Exhibit 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was retained by Hatch pursuant to a Subcontract Agreement dated November 27, 2012 as a subconsultant to provide geotechnical services with respect to the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd., filed April 5, 2018 at para 4. Copies of the Statement of Defence and Notice to Co-Defendants filed on behalf of Thurber Engineering Ltd. are attached as Appendix A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Thurber carries on business in Alberta and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP/Thurber Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of Thurber Corporation dated June 19, 2018 (&ldquo;Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 1, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Thurber employees identified to this point as having been involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Thurber Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit; Thurber Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 13 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On April 5, 2018, Thurber filed a Statement of Defence and Notices of Claim against Co-Defendants in this Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix A: Statement of Defence of Thurber Engineering Ltd. and Notice to Co-defendants filed April 5, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Through its Notices to Co-defendants, Thurber is seeking contribution and indemnity from each of the other defendants in this Action: Hatch, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact.</P>
<P>23. Clifton was also involved in providing geotechnical and environmental engineering services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Wayne Clifton filed March 29, 2018 (&ldquo;Clifton Affidavit&rdquo;), para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Clifton provided construction supervision for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Clifton is a federal corporation which maintains its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan and has offices in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, paras 2 and 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. CP retained Clifton to provide engineering oversight and review of Thurber's geotechnical work on the Belle Plaine Project pursuant to a Supply of Services Retainer into which CP and Clifton had entered effective January 1, 2010 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Retainer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 6 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Correspondence between CP and Clifton in respect of the Clifton Retainer was exchanged between their respective offices in Calgary and Regina. After having been executed on behalf of Clifton, the Clifton Retainer was executed and accepted by CP in Calgary and returned to Clifton by mail or courier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The Clifton Retainer prescribes the applicable law and jurisdiction:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Later, on April 8, 2015, CP and Clifton entered into a Supply of Services Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Clifton Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) under which Clifton was to provide professional geotechnical and environmental engineering services and construction supervision services for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Affidavit, para 11; Supply of Services Agreement between CP and Clifton dated April 8, 2016 (&ldquo;Clifton Contract&rdquo;), Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. Like the Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract reflects the express agreement between CP and Clifton prescribing the law applicable to the Clifton Contract and the forum in which disputes would be adjudicated, stating:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Governing Law:</BOLD> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any conflict of laws rules that may apply therein. The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. Construction of the Belle Plaine Project involved a significant earthworks component, in respect of which CP contracted with KPCL.</P>
<P>31. KPCL provides both construction and earthmoving services and was the main construction contractor for the Belle Plaine Project.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 5, 7 and 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> KPCL's contractual responsibilities pursuant to the contract in place between it and CP included the construction of the Qu-Appelle River crossing and adjacent embankments,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> one of which is the subject matter of this Action.</P>
<P>32. Throughout the course of its work on the Belle Plaine Project and, indeed, until approximately one month after KPCL was served with the Statement of Claim in this Action, KPCL was registered in Alberta as an extra-provincial corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; First Reply to Notice to Admit Facts of KPCL dated April 23, 2018 (&ldquo;KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 6, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. Altus, which is registered as a limited partnership in Alberta and maintains its head office within Alberta, provided survey services throughout the design and construction of the Belle Plaine Project under an agreement between CP and Altus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, paras 3 and 4. A copy of the Statement of Defence filed on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership is attached as Appendix B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On April 27, 2018, Altus filed a Statement of Defence to this Action. While Altus has not filed Notices to Co-defendants, in its Statement of Defence, Altus pleads and relies upon the <EM>Contributory Negligence Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c C-27 and the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c T-5.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appendix B: Statement of Defence on behalf of Altus Geomatics Limited Partnership, filed April 27, 2018, para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. Intact is the only defendant to this Action not directly involved in the design and/or construction of the Belle Plaine Project. The Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL required KPCL to provide CP with a performance bond through a duly licensed surety company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supply of Services Agreement between CP and KPCL dated March 12, 2015 (&ldquo;KPCL Contract&rdquo;), section GC35, Exhibit 8 to the Panteluk Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Intact was selected as that company.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Panteluk Affidavit, para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Intact, a federally regulated company,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit 19 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> carries on business and maintains offices in Alberta and is licensed to provide insurance in Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories dated June 12 2018 (&ldquo;Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories&rdquo;), paras 1&ndash;3, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. On or about May 28, 2015, Intact issued performance bond number XXXXXXXXXX KPCL (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Performance Bond</BOLD>&rdquo;), under which Intact bound itself as surety to CP for the performance of KPCL's work in connection with the KPCL Contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Performance Bond issued by Intact to KPCL on May 28, 2015, Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Trent Percy sworn March 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Percy Affidavit&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Despite having guaranteed the performance of KPCL's obligations with respect to the Belle Plaine Project, which included construction of the embankment that failed, Intact has refused to act upon the bond to address KPCL's defaults. Intact's failure to honour its obligations under the performance bond left CP in the position of having to fund all of the work in connection with KPCL's failures, without the benefit of the bond provided.</P>
<P>39. KPCL alleges that proceedings in Alberta will have a detrimental impact on KPCL's finances and its operations,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See, e.g. Panteluk Affidavit, paras 85 and 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet has remarkably refused to provide any of its financial information,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second CP/KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 28, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to Second Notice to Admit Facts dated June 8, 2018, para 5, Exhibit 15 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the inference being that the financial information would not support the allegations. In a similar vein, Intact initially provided sworn evidence that this dispute is presently having an impact on the bonding support Intact is able to provide to KPCL,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Percy Affidavit, para 9 and Exhibit C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> yet both KPCL and Intact have since confirmed that no such impact has been felt.</P>
<P>40. KPCL, for its part, concedes that it has not turned down any jobs, or declined to bid on any jobs, due to unavailability of bonding support or limitations on the scope of bonding available to it, whether through Intact or any other surety provider.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Responses to Written Interrogatories dated May 11, 2018, para 3, Exhibit 5 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, Intact has confirmed that at no time between January 1, 2016 and April 2018 has it refused any request for bonding from KPCL, nor has it reduced the amount of any bond issued to KPCL or otherwise limited the scope of bonding available to KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Intact Responses to Written Interrogatories, paras 4 and 6, Exhibit 10 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Therefore, the allegations of financial impact have no substantiation.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. CP's Statement of Claim was served soon after it was filed, as follows:
<P1>(a) KPCL was served in Estevan, Saskatchewan on January 10, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(b) Thurber was served in Victoria, British Columbia on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(c) Hatch was served in Mississauga, Ontario on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(d) Intact was served in Calgary, Alberta on January 11, 2018;</P1>
<P1>(e) Altus was served in Edmonton, Alberta on January 11, 2018; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Clifton was served in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 19, 2018.</P1></P>
<P>42. On February 6, 2018, almost a full month after service of the Statement of Claim in this Action, counsel for KPCL sought confirmation that an extension would be granted in respect of KPCL's Statement of Defence and that CP would not take any steps against KPCL in the interim. It is surely not a coincidence that until February 6, 2018, KPCL was registered with Alberta Registries as an extra-provincial corporation in the province of Alberta.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule A, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, paras 6 and 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Unbeknownst to CP, KPCL had previously filed a Statement of Claim against CP in Regina in Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 2177/2017 (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Saskatchewan Action</BOLD>&rdquo;). Like the within Action, KPCL's Saskatchewan Action concerns the Belle Plaine Project.</P>
<P>44. Although KPCL's Saskatchewan Action was filed in August 2017, KPCL took no steps to serve the claim at that point, but instead waited more than five months, including almost a full month <UNDER>after</UNDER> CP served the Statement of Claim in this Action upon KPCL.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 1, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 5, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Interestingly, it was not until February 7, 2018, after having secured CP's agreement to an extension in respect of its own Statement of Defence, that KPCL served CP with the KPCL Saskatchewan Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule B, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Upon receipt of KPCL's Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, CP immediately advised KPCL that it considered jurisdiction to be an issue in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action. Indeed, KPCL already knew that, as CP had initiated this Action in Alberta. On February 9, 2018, in the interests of efficiency and practicality, CP proposed that the jurisdictional issues in respect of KPCL's Saskatchewan Action be addressed as part of KPCL's planned application in respect of jurisdiction before this Court, obviating the need for a duplicate application before the Saskatchewan Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule C, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and thereby minimizing the cost and time associated with trying to deal with similar motions in separate jurisdictions.</P>
<P>46. KPCL refused. Rather, KPCL insisted that it was unable to consider CP's proposal until CP had filed an application of its own challenging jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, presumably for strategic reasons. KPCL also refused CP's request for an extension of time in respect of CP's Statement of Defence in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, a matter of courtesy regularly extended in the normal course.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First CP/KPCL Notice to Admit, para 3, Schedule D, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit; KPCL Reply to First Notice to Admit, para 7, Exhibit 14 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. Indeed, although KPCL filed its application challenging jurisdiction on February 8, 2018, it subsequently took the position that it was unable to even set its application down for a date certain, which would only serve to delay matters.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, Exhibits N-II, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Only after forcing a court appearance to address scheduling were the Jurisdiction Applications set down for July 4 and 5, 2018.</P>
<P>48. Despite the existence of not only CP's claim in the within Action, but its own claim in the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, both of which raise issues in respect of the obligations between CP and KPCL on the Belle Plaine Project and the performance of those obligations, on March 5, 2018 KPCL filed yet another claim against CP by way of Originating Application under Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench Action No. 655/2018, seeking payment of holdback funds relating to the Belle Plaine Project (&ldquo;<BOLD>KPCL Originating Application</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit dated May 11, 2018 (&ldquo;CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit&rdquo;), para 2, Exhibit 16 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. CP sought a stay of the need to challenge jurisdiction in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and KPCL's Originating Application (together, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Saskatchewan Actions</BOLD>&rdquo;), pending the determination of the Jurisdiction Applications. CP's application was heard before the Honourable Justice D.C. Chow in Regina on March 20 and 21, 2018. The Court reserved its decision and has not, as of the date of this brief, delivered its decision on those applications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>CP Reply to KPCL Notice to Admit, paras 4 - 5 .</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Indeed, Justice Chow was advised of KPCL's pending jurisdictional challenge before the Alberta Courts. CP argued that the need to bring an application in Saskatchewan to challenge jurisdiction was contrary to the foundational Rules in Saskatchewan and Alberta of trying to address matters in an efficient and cost effective manner, when the precise issue was to be determined in Alberta on July 4 and 5. KPCL, through its opposition to that and in filing further claims in Saskatchewan, seems opposed to the suggestion of efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>50. CP has not yet filed an application challenging jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and, accordingly, such applications&mdash;should they become necessary&mdash;have not yet been set down, let alone heard. It follows that neither of the Saskatchewan Actions have yet been set down for hearing.</P>
<P>51. On December 1, 2017, CP also filed a claim as against Marsh Canada Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh</BOLD>&rdquo;) in QB Action No. 1701-16251 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Marsh Action</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A copy of the Statement of Claim filed on behalf of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in QB Action No. 1701-16251 is attached as Appendix C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Marsh Action also concerns the Belle Plaine Project, but is specific to CP's allegations that breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of Marsh, which provided insurance brokerage services to CP, including in respect of insurance on the Belle Plaine Project, have resulted in damages to CP.</P>
<P>52. Marsh has undertaken to defend in the March Action and will not be challenging jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. DISCUSSION</TI>
<P>53. The analysis of the jurisdictional questions raised in respect of this Action has two distinct parts: the first addresses the jurisdiction of the Court <EM>simpliciter</EM>, while the second concerns the issue of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Haaretz.com v Goldhar</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 28</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Haaretz</EM></BOLD>], para 27, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 1</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>101&ndash;105</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Van Breda</EM></BOLD>] <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 2</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>54. Jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> is based upon the existence of a real and substantial connection between the forum and the subject matter of an action, as demonstrated by the presence of one or more presumptive connecting factors. To rebut a presumed real and substantial connection, the party challenging jurisdiction must establish that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter of the claim is such that it would &ldquo;not be reasonable to expect that the defendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction.&rdquo; The factors upon which the party seeking to rebut a presumed real and substantial connection should not be those considered during the second stage of the analysis, as the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is, and must remain, distinct.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 43, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 56, 81, 92 and 97</P1></P>
<P>55. Once jurisdiction is established through the real and substantial connection test, the claim will proceed in that jurisdiction unless a party challenging jurisdiction is able to show that exceptional circumstances exist such that another jurisdiction is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate.&rdquo; The bar is high&mdash;the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that:
<QUOTE><P>The use of the words &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo; should be interpreted as an acknowledgment that the normal state of affairs is that jurisdiction should be exercised once it is properly assumed. ... The court should not exercise its discretion in favour of a stay solely because it finds, once all relevant concerns and factors are weighed, that comparable forums exist in other provinces or states. It is not a matter of flipping a coin. A court hearing an application for a stay of proceedings must find that a forum exists that is in a better position to dispose fairly and efficiently of the litigation. ...</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 46, citing <EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 109</P1></P>
<P>56. Assessment of <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> is multi-factorial and requires a Court to consider the overall fairness and efficiency of proceeding in one jurisdiction as opposed to another, as determined based on factors ranging from the law applicable to the dispute to the location of physical evidence to the comparative convenience and expense for the parties and likely witnesses.</P>
<P>57. In this instance, the presumptive connecting factors between this claim and Alberta ground the jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> of the Alberta courts and there is no sound basis upon which the applying defendants may rebut this presumption.</P>
<P>58. Further, the applying defendants have failed to show that this matter invokes the exceptional circumstances that justify a determination that Saskatchewan is a clearly more appropriate forum in which to have this Action heard.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction <EM>Simpliciter</EM> by Consent</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. In this instance, four of the six defendants (Thurber, Altus, Clifton and Hatch) have consented to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. That fact, in itself, is sufficient to resolve the question of whether the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, to the extent that any such question truly arose. The real and substantial connection is between the forum and the subject of the action, not a particular or specific party.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><UNDER>Governing Principles</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. Parties are always at liberty to consent to a Court's jurisdiction. As confirmed by this Honourable Court, consent:
<QUOTE><P>permits jurisdiction over an extra-provincial defendant who consents, whether by voluntary submission, <UNDER><EM>attornment by appearance and defence</EM>, or prior agreement</UNDER> to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the domestic court.</P>
<P><CASEREF><SOC>Norex Petroleum Limited v Chubb Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 ABQB 442</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Norex</EM></BOLD>], para 49, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Muscutt et al v Carcelles et al</SOC><CITE>2002 OJ No 2128</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 19 [italicized emphasis in original, underline emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 3</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. If a party attorns, or consents contractually or otherwise to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court has jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> to hear the matter.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Meta4Hand Inc v Research In Motion Ltd</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 23</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Meta4Hand</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 4</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. Participation in the litigation process also constitutes attornment, and it is well established that when a party defends a lawsuit on the merits, it has implicitly submitted or attorned to the jurisdiction of the court in which the action was brought.
<P1><EM>Norex</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bansal v Ferrara Pan Candy Co</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 384</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>63. It is also open to parties to enter into commercial agreements regarding the forum in which disputes between them are to be adjudicated, and it is &ldquo;essential that courts give full weight to the desirability of holding contracting parties to [such] agreements.&rdquo; Where there is a valid agreement that includes an agreement as to jurisdiction, consideration of whether there is a real and substantial connection to the forum is redundant.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>ZI Pompey Industrie v ECU-Line NV</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>ZI Pompey</EM></BOLD>], paras 20 and 21, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 6</BOLD></P1>

<P>64. Forum selection clauses are a distinct element in consideration of jurisdiction, and should not be subsumed within the <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis. Further, forum selection clauses should be enforced unless there is &ldquo;strong cause&rdquo; not to do so. In this respect, the burden is on the party challenging jurisdiction to &ldquo;show sufficiently strong reasons to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just in the circumstances to require the [challenging party] to adhere to the terms of the clause.&rdquo;

<P>65. Inconvenience does not amount to strong cause. It is, for example, not open to parties who have entered into a contractual agreement with respect to forum to complain later that the evidence and witnesses may not be within that jurisdiction. Such facts either were or ought to have been known prior to entering into the agreement containing the forum selection provision and, to the extent that posed a concern, the appropriate time to raise the issue is at the time of contract negotiation. Allowing the location of witnesses and evidence to be raised after the fact would undermine commercially negotiated agreements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Atlantic Cement Carriers Ltd v Atlantic Towing Ltd</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 761</CITE><PARANUM>21 and 24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. In terms of their substance, forum selection clauses fall along a spectrum, from contracts which contain no such provisions to those which contain exclusive jurisdiction provisions under which the parties choose a single forum for the adjudication of disputes.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sugar v Megawheels Technologies Inc</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 4493</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Megawheels</EM></BOLD>], para 19, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 9</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. While even an exclusive attornment provision does not oust the jurisdiction of a local court, courts give significant weight to exclusive attornment provisions and should not interfere with the parties' selection of forum attornment provisions &ldquo;unless it is shown that the matter cannot be properly dealt with in the foreign court.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 20</P1></P>
<P>68. Non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions also carry significant weight. In <CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp. v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Virtue described such clauses as &ldquo;important consideration[s]&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;non-exclusive jurisdiction&rdquo; in the context of a forum selection clause means that the parties have attorned to that jurisdiction &ldquo;except in matters where some extraordinary condition or reason would require that the matter be determined elsewhere.&rdquo; Once a suit arises in the selected jurisdiction, the parties will be required to attorn.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>PWA Corp v Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>136 AR 73</CITE><COURTJUR>ABQB</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 28, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 10</BOLD></P1>

<P>69. Unsurprisingly, the operation of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is more limited in scope than that of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Essentially, under a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, &ldquo;either party may sue the other wherever it has the right to do so&rdquo;, but once one party initiates a suit in the named jurisdiction, the other party must keep its bargain by attorning to that jurisdiction.
<P1><EM>Megawheels</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 28</P1></P>
<P>70. While a forum selection clause must be applicable to the dispute in question in order to be given effect, it is inappropriate to parse the wordings of forum selection clauses too closely to determine whether they apply to the claims as pleaded, as this can foster &ldquo;dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute resolution.&rdquo; Courts interpret jurisdiction clauses broadly, and have rejected an approach in which fine distinctions are drawn based upon the language used.
<P1>Rafferty and Pitel, <EM>Conflict of Laws</EM>, 2nd ed (Irwin law: Toronto, 2010) at 131-132, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 12</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12</P1></P>
<P>71. Where a claim of negligence has arisen in a contractual relationship based upon an agreement which contains a forum selection clause, the forum selection is equally applicable to a claim in tort unless the clause clearly does <UNDER>not</UNDER> cover the dispute.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at 11-12-11-13</P1></P>
<P>72. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Kozicz v Preece</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered a claim in which the plaintiff had entered into two contracts with the defendants, one of which contained a forum selection clause through which the parties agreed that &ldquo;any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this Agreement&rdquo; was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware courts and the other of which contained no forum selection clause. The plaintiff sued in Ontario for negligent misrepresentation based upon the second contract. The defendants successfully sought a stay based upon the forum selection provision in the other contract, with the Court concluding that the claims in negligence were intertwined with the contract, making it inevitable that the contract would be before the court as part of the factual narrative and through the reliance of the defendants upon the contract in their defences, such that there was no basis not to enforce the forum selection provision.

<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><UNDER>Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>73. Thurber and Altus, having filed Statements of Defence that address the substance of the claims against them, have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts. The claims against them arising from the Belle Plains Project will proceed in Alberta. As well, the notices for contribution and indemnity will also, presumably, proceed.</P>
<P>74. Hatch and Clifton have also attorned, through their respective contracts with CP, to the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts in respect of this Action.</P>
<P>75. The validity of the Clifton Retainer, Clifton Contract and Hatch Contract is unchallenged, and there is no suggestion that this matter cannot properly be dealt with by the Alberta Courts.</P>
<P>76. Clifton and CP attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts through the Clifton Retainer and the Clifton Contract. Under the Clifton Retainer, CP and Clifton &ldquo;attorn[ed] to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Retainer, section 25, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Clifton Contract, for its part, stipulates that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Clifton Contract, section 26, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> reflecting Clifton's attornment to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts.</P>
<P>77. Both Hatch and CP attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts through the Hatch Contract, which states that &ldquo;[t]he parties hereby attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta, without prejudice to the rights of CP to take proceedings in any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, section 25, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The attornment provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Retainer and Clifton Contract contain no limitation as to subject matter scope. Certainly, they contain nothing that would suggest that they &ldquo;clearly [do] not&rdquo; cover claims in either breach of contract or tort, and it would be absurd to suggest that these provisions do not apply to breaches of the very contracts in which they appear.</P>
<P>79. This is consistent with the wording of the attornment provisions. In each of these Contracts, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is a long and detailed contract, expressly including not just the portion containing the terms in which the forum selection provisions are set out, but associated schedules providing descriptions of services, minimum requirements for personnel, security requirements, and other details regarding the work to be performed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Contract, page 1, Exhibit B to the Paton Affidavit; Clifton Retainer, page 1, Exhibit B to the Clifton Affidavit; Clifton Contract, page 1, Exhibit C to the Clifton Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More importantly, through the Hatch Contract, the Clifton Contract and the Clifton Retainer, Clifton and Hatch expressly agreed to provide services, meaning their engineering and design work in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; bringing not only contractual interpretation but the performance of the contract squarely within <UNDER>all</UNDER> of the terms of the Agreements, including the forum selection provision.</P>
<P>80. The proper interpretation of a forum selection clause was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the plaintiff sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the contractual duty of good faith, and alternatively for breach of agency duty and wrongful dismissal. The defendant applied for a stay of the action in British Columbia based upon the forum selection provision in the contract between the parties, which read:
<QUOTE><P>This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Saskatchewan in respect of its interpretation or breach.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hans v Volvo Trucks North America Inc</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1700</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 14</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>81. The claim launched was almost wholly unrelated to either the interpretation or breach of the contract that contained the jurisdiction clause, with the Court noting that it was not a case in which the parties &ldquo;had a difference of opinion over the interpretation of the contract or alleged the other to be in breach of it&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Volvo Trucks</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 53</P1></P>
<P>82. That is in sharp contrast to the present situation.</P>
<P>83. Here, there is no limitation upon the scope of the attornment provisions. Clifton and Hatch suggest that the absence of a limitation somehow indicates that the provisions are limited to interpretation. This, with respect, is a transparent effort to create ambiguity where none exists and should not be permitted.</P>
<P>84. CP, Clifton and Hatch have attorned (either exclusively or nonexclusively) to the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts&mdash;full stop. That attornment is, as suggested by the whole of each provision, in respect of the &ldquo;Agreements.&rdquo; CP's claims against both Hatch and Clifton expressly allege that those defendants are in breach of their respective Agreements with CP, bringing the claims directly within the scope of the forum selection provisions in the Hatch Contract, Clifton Contract and Clifton Retainer.</P>
<P>85. The Clifton Contract contains an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, as there is no suggestion that this claim cannot be properly dealt with by the Alberta Courts, there is no reason to interfere with this contractual provision.</P>
<P>86. The Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer contain non-exclusive jurisdiction provisions. Given that CP has filed the Statement of Claim in the within Action in Alberta&mdash;the selected forum&mdash;both Clifton and Hatch are contractually bound to the jurisdiction.</P>
<P>87. To the extent that this Honourable Court finds that the wording of the forum selection provision in the Clifton Contract allowed CP to begin proceedings in other jurisdiction affects the exclusivity of the provision in respect of Clifton (rather than CP alone, per the wording of the clause), the only result would be to transform the provision into one in which both parties had attorned to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts. The provision would then operate in the same way as the provisions within the Hatch Contract and the Clifton Retainer, meaning that Clifton would be required to attorn to CP's Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>88. In addition to the breach of contract claims set out in CP's Statement of Claim, claims of negligence have arisen within CP's contractual relationships with both Hatch and Clifton. CP's claims in contract and tort are intertwined, making this a situation in which the contractual attornment provisions are applicable to both.</P>
<P>89. For the foregoing reasons, the Alberta Courts have jurisdiction <EM>simplicter</EM> based upon the consent of Thurber, Altus, Hatch and Clifton. There is no reason, let alone strong cause, to oust this jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Jurisdiction Via Real and Substantial Connection</UNDER></TI>
<P>90. A court has jurisdiction over an action if there is a real and substantial connection between the action and the court's territory. The assumption of jurisdiction is justified under the real and substantial connection test where objective factors, as identified by the courts, connect the plaintiff's claim to the chosen forum. It is not necessary to show the <UNDER>most</UNDER> real and substantial connection, only that such a connection exists.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>&Ea;ditions &Ea;cosoci&ea;t&ea; Inc v Banro Corp</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 4</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 15</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ayles v Arsenault</SOC><CITE>2011 ABQB 493</CITE><PARANUM>21, 23 and 27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Ayles</EM></BOLD>] citing <CASEREF><SOC>Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye</SOC><CITE>[1990] 3 SCR 1077</CITE><PARANUM>43-44</PARANUM></CASEREF> amongst others, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>91. Further, a real and substantial connection between one alleged cause of action and the jurisdiction is sufficient to ground a Court's jurisdiction over the whole. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, Justice LeBel was explicit on this point, stating that:
<QUOTE><P>it is possible for a case to sound both in contract and in tort or to invoke more than one tort. Would a court be limited to hearing the specific part of the case that can be directly connected with the jurisdiction? Such a rule would breach the principles of fairness and efficiency on which the assumption of jurisdiction is based. The purpose of the conflicts rules is to establish whether a real and substantial connection exists between the forum, the subject matter of the litigation and the defendant. If such a connection exists in respect of a factual and legal situation, the court must assume jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. The plaintiff should not be obliged to litigate a tort claim in Manitoba and a related claim for restitution in Nova Scotia. That would be incompatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 99</P1></P>
<P>92. The following factors were identified in <EM>Van Breda</EM> as giving rise to a presumptive real and substantial connection:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) the tort was committed in the province; and</P>
<P>(d) a contract connected with the dispute was made in the province.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 90</P1></P>
<P>93. Where one of the factors giving rise to a real and substantial connection is present, the defendant bears the burden of rebutting the presumed connection. Rebutting the presumption, however, requires the party challenging jurisdiction to show that the connection is so weak that it would not be reasonable for that party to expect to be called to answer proceedings in the forum with which the real and substantial connection exists.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 95 and 97</P1>
<P1><EM>Ayles</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 27</P1></P>
<P>94. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada also recognized that, where there is a real and substantial connection for the purpose of satisfying the applicable rule for service <EM>ex juris</EM>, a real and substantial connection may be presumed to exist. While procedural directives such as the <EM>Rules of Court</EM> do not <UNDER>establish</UNDER> jurisdiction, they &ldquo;represent an expression of wisdom and experience drawn from the life of the law&rdquo; and &ldquo;are based on objective facts that may also indicate when courts can properly assume jurisdiction.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at paras 43 and 83</P1></P>
<P>95. In Alberta, the factors to be considered in assessing whether service <EM>ex juris</EM> is appropriate are set out in Rule 11.25(3), which states in part that:
<QUOTE><P>... in the following circumstances a real and substantial connection is presumed to exist: ...</P>
<P>(b) the claim relates to a contract or alleged contract made, performed or breached in Alberta;</P>
<P>(c) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta;...</P>
<P>(d) the claim relates to a tort committed in Alberta;...</P>
<P>(g) the defendant is resident in Alberta; ...</P>
<P>(i) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, Alta Reg 124/2010, rule 11.25(3) [<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 17</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>96. The analysis of jurisdiction simpliciter set out in <EM>Van Breda</EM> and the procedural rules for service <EM>ex juris</EM> are to be integrated in reaching a decision as to jurisdiction. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court concluded that for the purpose of service, the &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; connecting factor is a presumptive connecting factor where the subject matter of the action is connected to Alberta and the other principal players in the dispute are Alberta corporations. This only makes sense, otherwise different claims, involving different parties would need to be litigated in different jurisdictions even though they arise from a common set of facts. That could not, to use Justice Lebel's words, be compatible with any notion of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Incorporated v Arcis Seismic Solutions Corp</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 88</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD>Arcis</BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 18</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>97. In <CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc. v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Farrington relied upon <EM>Arcis</EM> as a post-<EM>Van Breda</EM> case that specifically retains &ldquo;necessary and proper party&rdquo; as a presumptive connecting factor, grounding a finding that the Court had jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM> in part on the necessary and proper party connection.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Geophysical Service Inc v Jebco Seismic UK Ltd</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 402</CITE><PARANUM>26-27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Jebco</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 19</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>98. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility</SOC></CASEREF> this Court affirmed that the factors set out in Rule 11. 25(3), including whether a defendant is a proper and necessary party, constitute presumptive real and substantial connections for the purpose of a jurisdictional analysis.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Turner v Bell Mobility Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ABQB 36</CITE><PARANUM>54 and 59</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 20</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>99. Accordingly, factors establishing a presumptive real and substantial connection include:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the defendant is domiciled or resident in the province;</P>
<P>(b) the defendant carries on business in the province;</P>
<P>(c) a contract connected with the dispute was made, performed or breached in the province;</P>
<P>(d) the tort was committed in the province;</P>
<P>(e) the claim is governed by the law of Alberta; and</P>
<P>(f) the defendant, although outside Alberta, is a necessary or proper party to the action brought against another person who was served in Alberta.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>100. In addition, while the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not a <EM>prima facie</EM> connecting factor, in <EM>Van Breda</EM> the Court suggested that the plaintiff's location is nonetheless relevant, stating that the:
<QUOTE><P>... presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction is not, <UNDER>on its own</UNDER>, a sufficient connecting factor. ... <UNDER>Absent other considerations,</UNDER> the presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction will not create a presumptive relationship between the forum and either the subject matter of the litigation or the defendant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 86 [emphasis added]</P1></P>
<P>101. In this case, while CP's presence in Alberta does not, on its own, establish the jurisdiction of the Alberta Courts, the fact that CP is resident and carries on business in Alberta is a further factor in favour of maintaining Alberta jurisdiction.</P>

<P>108.

<P>110. The Thurber Contract was made in Alberta and is connected to the subject matter of this dispute&mdash;this amounts to another presumptive real and substantial connection with Alberta.</P>
<P>111. Performance of a contract in Alberta is, equally, a presumptive real and substantial connection factor. Performance of a contract involves the fulfillment of an obligation or a promise under that contract.
<P1><EM>Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary</EM>, 7th ed., <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 22</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>112. In this case, both Hatch and Thurber had contractual obligations to perform engineering and geotechnical work on behalf of CP as part of the Belle Plaine Project. That work was carried out in Alberta.</P>
<P>113. Hatch employees involved in the Belle Plaine Project were located in Alberta while working on the Belle Plaine Project,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hatch Reply to Notice to Admit, paras 2 - 3, Exhibit 12 to the McArdle Affidavit.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the initial design work performed by Hatch was done within its office in Calgary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Paton Affidavit, para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>115. The work of engineering and designing the Belle Plaine Project, which was the driving purpose underlying the Hatch Contract, was performed in Alberta. Likewise, Thurber's work under the Thurber Contract, through which it provided engineering and geotechnical work for the Belle Plaine Project, occurred within Alberta. The performance of these contracts in Alberta constitutes a further real and substantial connection between Alberta and this Action.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>117. The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs where the representation is received or acted upon. It is, moreover, foreseeable that misrepresentations sent to a plaintiff's office in one jurisdiction would be received and relied upon by the plaintiff in another province. If the defendant foresees that its representations will be received or acted upon within a particular jurisdiction, it should expect to be called to account in proceedings in that jurisdiction. As explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal, &ldquo;[i]n the modem world where corporations have various offices in various locations, corporate defendants should not escape liability simply because they send studies [the studies being the source of the alleged misrepresentation] to an office of the plaintiff outside Ontario with the clear understanding that it will be acted on in Ontario.&rdquo;

<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 11.25(3)</P1></P>
<P>120. The Clifton Retainer, the Clifton Contract, and the Hatch Contract are all governed by the law of Alberta, pursuant to the following stipulation:

<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Necessary and Proper Parties to the Alberta Action</UNDER></TI>
<P>122. The test for determining whether an extra-territorial defendant is a necessary and proper party to a claim so as to confer jurisdiction turns on whether:
<QUOTE><P>supposing both parties had been within the jurisdiction would they both have been proper parties to the action? If they would, and only one of them is in this country, then the rule says that the other may be served, just as if he had been within the jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>

<P>123. The &ldquo;necessary or proper party&rdquo; factor is a presumptive connecting factor for the purposes of determining jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.

<P>124. Altus is an Alberta corporation and was served in Alberta. The only question under this factor in the analysis is whether the other defendants, had they been in Alberta, would have been proper parties to the claim.</P>
<P>125. The answer to this question in respect of each of the other defendants is resoundingly yes.</P>
<P>126.

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Forum Non Conveniens</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>127. The <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis is distinct from, and irrelevant to, the question of jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>.
<P1><EM>Haaretz</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 27-28</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 101</P1></P>
<P>128. Where a Court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a real and substantial connection, it retains a residual discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the basis that it is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>, and that another forum is preferable. The onus is on the party seeking a stay on this basis to show that an alternate forum is &ldquo;clearly more appropriate&rdquo;, based not upon the preferences of the parties as KPCL suggests,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>KPCL Brief, paras 133&ndash;136.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but upon the requirements of fairness and efficiency.
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 105 and 108</P1></P>
<P>129. A proper <EM>forum non conveniens</EM> analysis does not dissect the claims in an effort to separate constituent causes of action or claims against individual parties that might, in the absence of the larger proceeding, be outside the jurisdiction of the court in which an action has been filed. Rather, where multiple claims are brought within one proceeding, the action is to be considered as a whole to assess whether a jurisdiction is <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>.
<P1><EM>Canadian Conflict of Laws</EM>, supra at 13&ndash;23</P1></P>
<P>130. As with jurisdiction <EM>simpliciter</EM>, there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing a challenge to jurisdiction based on <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>. In <EM>Van Breda</EM>, the Court identified the following as potentially relevant, depending on the context:
<P1>(a) the locations of parties and witnesses;</P1>
<P1>(b) the cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay;</P1>
<P1>(c) the impact of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the possibility of conflicting judgments;</P1>
<P1>(e) problems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the relative strengths of the connections of the two parties.</P1>
<P1><EM>Van Breda</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 110</P1></P>
<P>131. The factors identified in the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's <EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> are also relevant to assessing forum <EM>non conveniens</EM>, even where, as here, the forum challenged has not adopted that type of legislation.
<P1><EM>Uniform Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM> [<BOLD><EM>CJPTA</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 26</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breeden v Black</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 19</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Breeden</EM></BOLD>], para 23, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 27</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>132. Accordingly, the following <EM>CJPTA</EM> factors are also relevant when assessing <EM>forum non conveniens</EM>:
<P1>(a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum;</P1>
<P1>(b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding;</P1>
<P1>(c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings;</P1>
<P1>(d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts;</P1>
<P1>(e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole.</P1>
<P1><EM>Breeden</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 23, citing section 11(2) of the <EM>CJPTA</EM></P1></P>
<P>133. In cases involving more than one potentially appropriate forum, there is a presumption in favour of the forum selected by the plaintiff, which &ldquo;wins by default if there is no clearly preferable alternative.&rdquo;

<P>135. As this shows, of 48 likely witnesses CP has identified to date, 18 (or 33%) are in Saskatchewan, 16 are in Alberta, and the remainder are either outside both jurisdictions or in unknown locations.</P>
<P>136. Regardless of the jurisdiction in which this Action is heard, it will undoubtedly be inconvenient for witnesses to travel from one jurisdiction to another for questioning and, eventually, trial. Moreover, there will be expenses associated with that process. CP is certainly prepared to assist in minimizing both the cost and inconvenience by attending upon witnesses in their own jurisdictions for questioning, as may be reasonable.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>141. Regardless of where this Action proceeds, witnesses and parties will be inconvenienced. Expenses will be incurred. There is no basis upon which to assume that travel from Saskatchewan to Alberta is more expensive or inconvenient than travel in the other direction, and the parties, witnesses and records are balanced as between Alberta and Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>Cost of Transfer</UNDER></TI>
<P>142. At this stage, there would be little cost associated with a transfer of either the Saskatchewan Actions to Alberta or with transferring this Action to Saskatchewan, recognizing that two defendants have already defended the Alberta action and they may have issues with being somehow forced into Saskatchewan.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(e)</N><TI>Comparative Convenience/Expense</TI>
<P>143. However, the comparative convenience of proceeding in Alberta as opposed to Saskatchewan cannot be considered without reference to the forum selection clauses that apply to Hatch and Clifton, as outlined above. As explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd. v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>it must be the rare case where [balance of convenience and expense] alone is so overwhelming as to be determinative if all other considerations are largely neutral or would dictate that the parties' agreement be upheld. That must be particularly so when, as here, the choice is between two common law jurisdictions in this country. A party who resides or carries on business in British Columbia but who agrees to litigate disputes in the courts of another province must be taken to have accepted at the time the agreement was made that there could be a significant measure of inconvenience and expense associated with geographical distances. That party should not then, without more, be easily relieved of the contractual obligation it agreed to bear.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Reuna Ventures Ltd v Refco Futures (Canada) Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1996] BCJ No. 2148</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 29</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>144. If only the locations of the likely witnesses, the parties and the records regarding this claim were taken into account, the assessment of comparative convenience weighs slightly in favour of Alberta. However, once the jurisdiction clauses are also considered, as they must be, it is clear that neither Hatch nor Clifton ought to be relieved of any additional inconvenience or expense associated with the contractual agreements they accepted. As a result, on the whole, this factor weighs strongly in favour of Alberta's jurisdiction over this Action.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>Law to be Applied</UNDER></TI>
<P>145. The law to be applied to the claims in breach of contract as against Hatch and Clifton is unquestionably the law of Alberta, which is also applicable to the claim of negligent misrepresentation against Clifton and claims in relation to the Thurber Contract. There is, moreover, no reason that if an Alberta court was required to apply Saskatchewan law it could not do so, even in respect of claims requiring interpretation of Saskatchewan legislation such as <EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, which CP says has no application in any event in the within matters.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kerr Interior Systems Ltd v Kenroc Building and Materials Co Ltd</SOC><CITE>2009 ABCA 240</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 30</BOLD></P1>
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, SS 1984-85-86, c B-7.1, [<BOLD><EM>Builders' Lien Act</EM></BOLD>], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 31</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>146. While the law of Saskatchewan may apply to some of CP's claims in tort depending on how the Court construes the place where the tort occurred, and potentially to CP's claims in contract as against KPCL and Intact, Alberta courts could apply that law without issue, which would be no different than the Saskatchewan courts being called upon to apply Alberta law in accordance with the choice of law provisions if this Action were to be transferred to Saskatchewan.</P>
<P>147. In either event, the general law of contract and tort are essentially the same in both places, rendering this a neutral factor.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Yara Belle Plaine Inc v Ingersoll-Rand Company et al</SOC><CITE>2014 SKQB 254</CITE><PARANUM>76</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 32</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments</UNDER></TI>
<P>148. This factor is neutral, as a judgment granted by either the Saskatchewan or Alberta courts would be recognized in the other jurisdiction. Enforcement will be facilitated by the <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c R-6 and <EM>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act</EM>, RSS 1978, c R-3.

<BLOCK4><N>(h)</N><TI><UNDER>Avoiding Multiplicity of Legal Proceedings</UNDER></TI>
<P>149. Rule 1.2(2) of the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM> highlights the importance of efficiency in Court proceedings, a goal that is even more important in view of the scarcity of judicial resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Generally, avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings is more efficient in terms of the proceedings themselves and in the use of judicial resources.
<P1><EM>Rules</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, rule 1.2(2)</P1></P>
<P>150. In this case, KPCL itself has, it appears, intentionally created a multiplicity of actions by filing the Originating Application in the face of its own Saskatchewan Action, seeking through both claims further payments in respect of KPCL's work on the Belle Plaine Project and corresponding determinations of KPCL's alleged rights under the KPCL Contract, all of which are raised squarely in this Action in Alberta.</P>
<P>151. It is questionable whether KPCL's second action was commenced genuinely or reflects an effort to bootstrap the current jurisdiction motion. KPCL, if it was looking for efficiency or cost-effectiveness or to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, could equally have simply added its claim in respect of holdback funds under the KPCL Contract to the KPCL Saskatchewan Action or, of course, to the present claim.</P>
<P>152. In addition to <UNDER>creating</UNDER> a multiplicity of claims, seemingly for the sake of multiplicity, the substance of the KPCL Originating Application is also questionable. No lien can arise in respect of the Belle Plaine Project, which constitutes a federal undertaking.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canadian National Railway Co v Nor-Min Supplies Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1977] 1 SCR 322</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 35</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>153. In the absence of a lien, KPCL is not a &ldquo;lien claimant&rdquo;, as defined within the Builders' Lien Act, and so is not entitled to the remedies available to lien claimants thereunder. Moreover, it is not a trustee or the beneficiary of a trust within the meaning of the Builders' Lien Act. As a result, the remedies KPCL seeks in the KPCL Originating Application are simply unavailable to it, which again begs the question of why KPCL decided to file yet another action for such in Saskatchewan, given its jurisdictional challenge was, in February of this year, set for hearing in early July.
<P1><EM>The Builders' Lien Act</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at ss 6(2), 17(1)(a), 38(6) and (7)</P1></P>
<P>154. In addition to having launched multiple actions regarding essentially the same subject matter, which in the usual course would amount to an abuse of process, KPCL has appeared to insist on multiple jurisdiction applications in different provinces, with its principal noting that he &ldquo;would like the Saskatchewan court to have the opportunity to address whether it will exercise jurisdiction,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Kelly Panteluk filed March 5, 2018, para 35, Schedule F to KPCL Notice to Admit to CP dated May 11, 2018.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> despite the fact that KPCL is in the process of having this Honourable Court consider the very same question.</P>
<P>155. Multiplicity of proceedings is to be avoided. That is axiomatic. This basic principle, which reflects the inherent interest in efficiency, is embedded not only in the <EM>Rules</EM> but also in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2 (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Judicature Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). As confirmed in the <EM>Judicature Act</EM>, as a corollary to the principle that multiple proceedings regarding the same issues should be avoided, another of the Court's objectives is to ensure that all issues in controversy between the parties are determined as completely and finally as possible. This is the case in every province.
<P1><EM>Judicature Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c J-2, ss 5(3)(f) and 8, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 36</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>156. In these circumstances, the twin objectives of avoiding multiple proceedings and allowing all issues to be determined as completely and finally as possible militates in favour of allowing this Action to proceed in Alberta, where all of the likely parties to the claim are already parties to the Action, four of the defendants have consented to the Court's jurisdiction, and the remaining two are not only defendants to CP's Statement of Claim but also respondents to a Notice to Co-defendants.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness and Efficiency</UNDER></TI>
<P>157. CP wasted no time in proceeding with its claim in Alberta. KPCL, in contrast, waited 5 months to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action, to which it now points as a parallel proceeding warranting transfer of the within Action to Saskatchewan, until CP's Action had been filed and served, and even then served the KPCL Saskatchewan Action only two days before KPCL's defence was due in this Action. KPCL then served a further proceeding against CP by way of Originating Application, which overlaps significantly with the issues in KPCL's Saskatchewan Action and this claim.</P>
<P>158. This Action has, from the outset, included Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, KPCL, Altus and Intact as Defendants. KPCL's Saskatchewan Action, in contrast, is against only CP. To bring this Action within the KPCL Saskatchewan Action, CP would have to initiate a Counterclaim against KPCL and claim against Hatch, Thurber, Clifton, Altus and Intact as parties, but this is already underway in this Action.</P>
<P>159. Then, of course, the question will arise about the propriety of dragging Altus and Thurber to Saskatchewan, when they have defended in Alberta. On the other hand, if the Action proceeds in Alberta, the issues will all be addressed, against all relevant parties, in one Action</P>
<P>160. Allowing this Action to proceed will also allow determination of the issues in the Saskatchewan Actions, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplicative proceedings. The issues are, in substance, the same, as they relate to issues arising from the construction of the Belle Plaine Project. KPCL should not be rewarded for having waited to serve the Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Action or for filing a further duplicative claim by being allowed to rely on the Saskatchewan Actions as reason to transfer this Action out of Alberta.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(j)</N><TI><UNDER>Juridical Advantage</UNDER></TI>
<P>161. While CP recognizes that juridical advantage is of less weight in assessing jurisdiction as between provinces than in an international context, in this instance proceedings in Alberta, CP's chosen forum, offer two juridical benefits. There is no basis upon which to deprive CP of either.</P>
<P>162. One is a benefit to all parties in the context of this litigation. Under the <EM>Alberta Rules of Court</EM>, there is no formal limit to the number of corporate witnesses who may be questioned. In contrast, under the Saskatchewan <EM>Queen's Bench Rules</EM>, parties are entitled to question only one representative of a corporation in the absence of a Court Order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Gibbings, Q.C., filed March 29, 2018, para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While CP expects that this would be addressed by agreement amongst counsel, given the complex and highly technical nature of the subject matter of this claim, it is important to ensure that fulsome questioning is available.</P>
<P>163. Further, if this Action is stayed or set aside, the defendants may attempt to argue that CP is barred from proceeding with an action in Saskatchewan by virtue of <EM>The Limitations Act</EM>, SS 2004, c L-16.1, which may be the actual motivation behind KPCL's multiplicity of actions and applications. In contrast, there is no question that CP's Statement of Claim in this Action was filed and served within the appropriate time. It would, to put it mildly, be a significant loss of the juridical advantage of proceeding in Alberta if CP were to find itself time barred in an alternate forum.</P>
<P>164. If this Court determines that CP's choice of forum and the submission to jurisdiction of Thurber and Altus should be disregarded, and concludes that the jurisdictional provisions in the contracts between CP and Hatch and CP and Clifton need not be honoured, any resulting transfer of this Action should be undertaken pursuant to the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, SS 1997 c C-41.1.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Attornment to Saskatchewan</UNDER></TI>
<P>165. Taking steps to contest the substantive merits of a claim is the principal hallmark of attornment. Filing an application to object to the jurisdiction of the forum is not attornment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Manson v Canada (Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 ABCA 212</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 37</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>166. The suggestion that this Action be stayed or set aside in favour of proceedings in Saskatchewan appears to ignore the fact that a portion of CP's claim will remain within the jurisdiction. CP's Statement of Claim against Thurber and Altus is separate and apart from the Jurisdiction Applications. These claims, as well as any claims arising under the <EM>Tort-Feasors Act</EM>, will need to be addressed in any event.</P>
<P>167. CP intentionally has not, to this point, taken any steps to contest the merits of either of the Saskatchewan Actions. Rather, CP has sought only to address initial matters preliminary to potential applications in respect of jurisdiction. This does not constitute attornment.</P>
<P>168. In <CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC></CASEREF>, the defendant brought a motion to stay the Plaintiff's action in Ontario, and submitted that Quebec was the more appropriate forum for the action. The plaintiff filed his action in Ontario, then the defendant brought a parallel action in Quebec. After both actions had commenced, the plaintiff brought a motion for interim and interlocutory injunctive relief. That relief was granted. In the course of granting a stay of the Ontario action, the Court explained that:
<QUOTE><P>the defendant has not attorned to the Ontario Court's jurisdiction but <UNDER>was required to respond to the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief</UNDER> because the plaintiff refused the defendant's request for an adjournment of the plaintiff's motion and to permit her first to bring a motion to contest the forum. As such, <UNDER>the defendant came before [the justice hearing the injunction motion] under duress</UNDER>, after clearly signalling her intention to contest jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Jafarzadehahmadsargoorabi v Sabet</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 5827</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2012 ONCA 391</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> [emphasis added], <BOLD>Authorities at Tab 38</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>169. Similarly, in this case CP was required to respond to KPCL's Originating Application, as KPCL had amply demonstrated its unwillingness to adjourn pending the hearing of its existing Jurisdiction Application. CP has, from its first interactions with KPCL, signalled its intention to contest jurisdiction in respect of the Saskatchewan Actions and has taken no steps to contest the merits of either matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
