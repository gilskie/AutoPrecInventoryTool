<P>This is an application for judicial review in respect of</P>
<P>Two letters received from the Canada Revenue Agency International tax services office:</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>1<SUP>st</SUP> letter on August 23, 2012</UNDER></TI>
<P>This letter declined my appeal for relief from the application of penalty for late filing of my 2010 nonresident income tax return.</P>
<P>The letter gave me the option to appeal the decision based on section 18.1, which I did (court file no. T-116-13).</P>
<P>This application/proceedings had reached the stage where I had submitted written cross examination to the respondent.</P>
<P>However the respondents counsel at the time Mr Ricky Tang called me to say that I had produced some valid arguments in my cross examination and he verily believes that my appeal should be granted. So he does not see any benefit in taking this matter any further and will send the file back to Revenue Canada to make the necessary adjustments.</P>
<P>He did mention that in order to do this, I would have to sign a notice of discontinuance, which I did on or around May 6<SUP>th</SUP> 2013.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>2<SUP>nd</SUP> letter on July 23, 2013</UNDER></TI>
<P>This letter once again declined my appeal for relief from the application of penalty for late filing of my 2010 nonresident income tax return.</P>
<P>The letter has once again given me the option to appeal the decision based on section 18.1, which means I will now have to start the entire process all over.</P>
<P>The applicant makes application for:</P>
<P>I am asking that the Honorable Judge of the Federal Court of Canada grant me relief from the application of penalty for late filing of my 2010 nonresident income tax return.</P>
<P>The grounds for the application are:
<P1>1. Failed to observe a principle of procedural fairness.</P1>
<P1>2. Did not adequately consider extraordinary circumstances.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF NICHOLAS PERON</TI>
<P>I, NICHOLAS PERON, of the City of Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am an officer with the International Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) and made the decision to deny the applicant's request for an extension of time to file Ms 2010 Subsection 216(4) Income Tax Return (the &ldquo;S.216(4) Return&rdquo;) pursuant to subsections 216(4) and 220(3) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.), as amended (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;). As such, I have personal knowledge of the matters deposed to, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief. Where I have referred in my affidavit to information obtained from specific sources, I believe that information to be true. Where I have referred in my affidavit to information without disclosing the source, the information was derived either from my first-hand knowledge or from my review of the CRA file for the applicant.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Failure to File Return: Notifications</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. By letter dated March 30, 2009, the CRA notified the applicant that he was considered a non-resident and may be subject to non-resident withholding tax on rental income received from a Canadian source. A true copy of this letter dated March 30, 2009 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P>
<P>3. By letter dated January 21, 2010, the CRA informed the applicant that his submission for an &ldquo;Undertaking to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty&rdquo; for the 2010 taxation year (the &ldquo;NR6 Form&rdquo;) was incomplete and was being returned to him. A true copy of this letter dated January 21, 2010 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P>
<P>4. By letter dated February 9, 2010, the CRA acknowledged receipt of the Applicant's NR6 Form and deemed it to apply for the 2010 taxation year. A true copy of this letter dated February 9, 2010 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P>
<P>5. By letter dated December 31, 2010 and received by the CRA on January 16, 2011, the applicant attempted to advise the CRA that he had returned to Canada and was no longer a non-resident by submitting the form &ldquo;Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada&rdquo; (the &ldquo;NR4 Form&rdquo;). The applicant also indicated that he had attached a cheque in the amount of $180 and requested that his non-residency account be closed. A true copy of the letter dated December 31, 2010 and NR4 Form is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</P>
<P>6. On February 16, 2011, Horace Sailsman, who was acting as the applicant's representative (the &ldquo;Representative&rdquo;) telephoned the CRA to see if the NR4 Form was received and also asked to close the non-residency account once it was processed. An officer of the CRA advised the Representative that the CRA had received the NR4 Form but had not yet processed it A true copy of the Account Notes for Account XXXXXXXXXX is attached here to as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</P>
<P>7. By letter dated September 26, 2011, the CRA advised the Representative that the applicant failed to file a S.216(4) Return as undertaken by his NR6 Form by the June 30, 2011 deadline. The CRA further advised the applicant that a 25% non-resident tax was thus payable. A true copy of this letter dated September 26, 2011 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P>
<P>8. By letter dated October 9, 2011, the Representative advised the CRA that the applicant was not aware that he was required to file a S.216(4) Return for the 2010 taxation year as he had already filed a NR4 Form with a letter indicating that he had reclaimed residency status and had requested that the non-resident account be closed. The applicant also attached to the letter a S.216(4) Return. A true copy of this letter dated October 9, 2011 and S.216(4) Return is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P>
<P>9. By letter dated February 2, 2012, the CRA acknowledged receiving the applicant's letter of October 9, 2011, and informed the applicant that the matter would be referred to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration (the &ldquo;Request&rdquo;). A true copy of this letter dated February 2, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;First Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. By letter dated March 1, 2012, the CRA informed the applicant that it had treated the applicant's letter of October 9, 2011 as a request for an extension of time to file a S.216(4) Return under subsection 220(3) of the <EM>Act</EM> (the &ldquo;First Request&rdquo;). The CRA further informed the applicant that it had sent the submission to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration. A true copy of this letter dated March 1, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</P>
<P>11. Rajah Nithiya, a Taxpayer Relief Officer with the CRA, reviewed and considered the First Request As a result of the review, Mr. Nithiya recommended to deny the request for an extension of time to file and cancellation of the Part XIII assessment. Mr. Nithiya noted that the applicant was not a first time non-resident tax filer and had filed his 2009 non-resident return on time so should have been aware of the filing requirements for the 2010 taxation year. Further, Mr. Nithiya noted that the only reason given for the late filing was that the applicant misunderstood the process as he believed his letter requesting the non-resident account be closed would obviate the need to file a S.216(4) Return for the 2010 taxation year. However, Mr. Nithiya stated that negligence or carelessness do not validate circumstances that were beyond a taxpayer's control in meeting their filing requirement and thus recommended to deny the applicant's request. A true copy of the memorandum dated March 7, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;.</P>
<P>12. Mr, Nithiya's recommendation to deny relief was approved by Rhonda Pommainville, a Team Leader with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the memorandum dated March 7, 2012.</P>
<P>13. By letter dated March 12, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the request for extension of time to file and cancellation of the Part XIII assessment (the &ldquo;First Level Decision&rdquo;). A true copy of the First Level Decision is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;Second Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. By fax dated March 28, 2012, the applicant applied to the Director of International Tax Services of the CRA for reconsideration of the CRA's decision to deny his request for extension of time to file his 2010 S.216(4) Return (the &ldquo;Second Request&rdquo;). This letter was treated as a request for an administrative review of the First Level Decision. A true copy of the Second Request dated March 28, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;.</P>
<P>15. By letter dated April 16, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant that it had received the Second Request and had sent his submission to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration. A true copy of the letter dated April 16, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;.</P>
<P>16. Beryl Hobbs, a Taxpayer Relief Officer of the International Tax Services Office of the CRA was assigned the task of reviewing the applicant's request for administrative review of the First Level Decision (the &ldquo;Second Level Decision&rdquo;).</P>
<P>17. During her review of the applicant's Second Request, Ms. Hobbs reviewed and considered the following:
<P1>(a) all records pertaining to the applicant available on the CRA's online computer system;</P1>
<P1>(b) all of the facts as represented by the applicant set out in the paragraphs above; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant's submission that he was undergoing family difficulties, his representative is his father who was 79 years old, and that he believed submitting an NR4 form along with a cheque and letter notifying of his change in status would make him compliant with his S.216(4) obligations.</P1></P>
<P>18. Ms. Hobbs' analysis of the applicant's submission is contained in her report dated July 16, 2012 (the &ldquo;Second Level Report&rdquo;). A true copy of the Second Level Report as well as CRA computer printouts &ldquo;Account Notes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tax Filing History&rdquo; is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;. In summary, she noted the following:
<P1>(a) it was not the applicant's first time for filing a S.216(4) Return as he had filed one for the 2009 taxation year on time;</P1>
<P1>(b) the applicant was notified by letter dated February 9, 2010 advising him of his filing requirements and the deadline of June 30, 2011; and</P1>
<P1>(c) there was no indication of any extraordinary circumstances which prevented the applicant from filing the required return for the 2010 taxation year on time.</P1></P>
<P>19. Based on the above, Ms. Hobbs therefore recommended that the Second Request be denied.</P>
<P>20. Ms. Hobbs' recommendation to deny relief was reviewed and recommended by the. following CRA officers:
<P1>(a) Dragan Milasin, a Team Leader with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Second Level Report dated July 16, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(b) Elaine Whiteman, a Manager with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 16, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(c) Adnan Khan, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Second Level Report dated July 17, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(d) Kathleen Butler, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 20, 2012; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Gillian Pranke, a Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 24, 2012. The director had the ultimate signing authority and her word is final.</P1></P>
<P>21. By letter dated August 23, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the Second Request for relief (the &ldquo;Second Level Decision&rdquo;). A true copy of the Second Level Decision dated August 23, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Judicial Review of the Second Level Decision</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. On January 16, 2013, the applicant made an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the Second Level Decision.</P>
<P>23. On May 5, 2013, the applicant discontinued the application as the respondent agreed to refer the Request for reconsideration by another officer of the CRA not previously involved in the matter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;Third Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. I was assigned the task of reviewing the applicant's request for administrative review of the Second Level Decision (the &ldquo;Third Request&rdquo;).</P>
<P>25. During my review of the applicant's Request, I reviewed and considered, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following:
<P1>(a) all records pertaining to the applicant available on the CRA's online computer system;</P1>
<P1>(b) all of the facts as represented by the applicant set out in the paragraphs above as well as the First Level Decision and Second Level Decision; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant's submission that he was undergoing family difficulties, his representative is his father who was 79 years old, and that he believed submitting an NR4 form along with a cheque and letter notifying of his change in status would make him compliant with his S.216(4) obligations.</P1></P>
<P>26. My analysis of the applicant's submission is contained in my report dated June 17, 2013 (the &ldquo;Third Level Report&rdquo;). A true copy of the Third Level Report is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;. In summary, I noted the following:
<P1>(a) the phone calls the Agent made to the CRA on February 16, 2011 as well as when the applicant returned to Canada in 2011 would not have prompted a CRA phone agent to advise him of the applicant's tax filing requirements unless he volunteered the information that he was collecting rental income as a non-resident. This is because a CRA phone agent would not know the requirements of each taxpayer's specific situation;</P1>
<P1>(b) the applicant not knowing his filing requirements is not a valid reason as per the Self-Assessment Policy;</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant and his agent were advised of the filing requirement on the NR6 form and the approval letters issued to them when the NR6 was approved;</P1>
<P1>(d) in regards to the divorce and custody battle, the events outlined by the applicant all occurred in the 2010 tax year. He had returned to Canada in 2011 and the S.216(4) Return was due months after the events as described;</P1>
<P1>(e) the applicant stated that when he was in Canada he had to start all over and that his son was traumatized and he needed to focus on that but does not elaborate how this prevented him from filing; and</P1>
<P1>(f) despite the above claims, the applicant filed an immigrant/emigrant income tax return on May 17, 2011 which demonstrated that he was able to file a return during the period, two months prior to the due date for the S.216(4) Return. A true copy of the Income Tax Return filed on May 17, 2011 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>27. Based on the above, I therefore recommended that the Second Request be denied.</P>
<P>28. My recommendation to deny relief was reviewed and recommended by the following CRA officers:
<P1>(a) Derrick Ward, a Team Leader with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Third Level Report dated June 28, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(b) Andrea Schieda for Elaine Whiteman, a Manager with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Third Level Report dated July 2, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(c) Krista Dease for John Paisley, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Third Level Report dated July 2, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(d) Brian Rae, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Third Level Report dated July 3, 2013; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Gillian Pranke, a Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Third Level Report. The director had the ultimate signing authority and her word is final.</P1></P>
<P>29. By letter dated July 23, 2013, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the Third Request for relief (the &ldquo;Third Level Decision&rdquo;). A true copy of the Third Level Decision dated July 23, 2013 is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</P>
<P>30. I make this affidavit in response to the applicant's application for judicial review of the CRA's Third Level Decision and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The applicant failed to file a subsection 216(4) Income Tax Return for the 2010 taxation year by the required deadline. In exercising the discretion conferred under subsection 220(3) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended [<EM>Income Tax Act</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, the Minister of National Revenue refused to exercise his discretion to accept the applicant's request for an extension of time. The Minister considered all of the relevant facts and exercised its discretion in a reasonable manner in the circumstances of this case. There is no basis to interfere with the Minister's decision.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART I&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Failure to File Return: Notifications</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. By letter dated March 30, 2009, the CRA notified the applicant that he was considered a non-resident and may be subject to non-resident withholding tax on rental income received from a Canadian source.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. By letter dated January 21, 2010, the CRA informed the applicant that his submission for an &ldquo;Undertaking to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty&rdquo; for the 2010 taxation year (the &ldquo;NR6 Form&rdquo;) was incomplete and was being returned to him.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. By letter dated February 9, 2010, the CRA acknowledged receipt of the Applicant's NR6 Form and deemed it to apply for the 2010 taxation year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. By letter dated December 31, 2010 and received by the CRA on January 16, 2011, the applicant attempted to advise the CRA that he had returned to Canada and was no longer a non-resident by submitting the form &ldquo;Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada&rdquo; (the &ldquo;NR4 Form&rdquo;). The applicant also indicated that he had attached a cheque in the amount of $180 and requested that his non-residency account be closed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. On February 16, 2011, Horace Sailsman, who was acting as the applicant's representative (the &ldquo;Representative&rdquo;), telephoned the CRA to inquire if the NR4 Form was received and also asked to close the non-residency account once it was processed. An officer of the CRA advised the Representative that the CRA had received the NR4 Form but had not yet processed it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. By letter dated September 26, 2011, the CRA advised the Representative that the applicant failed to file a S.216(4) Return as undertaken by his NR6 Form by the June 30, 2011 deadline. The CRA further advised the applicant that a 25% non-resident tax was thus payable on Canadian rental income received by the applicant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. By letter dated October 9, 2011, the Representative advised the CRA that the applicant was not aware that he was required to file a S.216(4) Return for the 2010 taxation year as he had already filed a NR4 Form with a letter indicating that he had reclaimed residency status and had requested that the non-resident account be closed. The applicant also attached to the letter a S.216(4) Return.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. By letter dated February 2, 2012, the CRA acknowledged receiving the applicant's letter of October 9, 2011, and informed the applicant that the matter would be referred to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration (the &ldquo;Request&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;First Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. By letter dated March 1, 2012, the CRA informed the applicant that it had treated the applicant's letter of October 9, 2011 as a request for an extension of time to file a S.216(4) Return under subsection 220(3) of the <EM>Act</EM> (the &ldquo;First Request&rdquo;). The CRA further informed the applicant that it had sent the submission to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. Rajah Nithiya, a Taxpayer Relief Officer with the CRA, reviewed and considered the First Request. As a result of the review, Mr. Nithiya recommended that the request for an extension of time to file and cancellation of the Part XIII assessment be denied. Mr. Nithiya noted that the applicant was not a first time non-resident tax filer and had filed his 2009 non-resident return on time so should have been aware of the filing requirements for the 2010 taxation year. Further, Mr. Nithiya noted that the only reason given for the late filing was that the applicant misunderstood the process as he believed his letter requesting the non-resident account be closed would obviate the need to file a S.216(4) Return for the 2010 taxation year. However, Mr. Nithiya stated that negligence or carelessness do not constitute circumstances that were beyond a taxpayer's control in meeting their filing requirement and thus recommended to deny the applicant's request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Mr. Nithiya's recommendation to deny relief was approved by Rhonda Pommainville, a Team Leader with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the memorandum dated March 7, 2012.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. By letter dated March 12, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the request for extension of time to file and cancellation of the Part XIII assessment (the &ldquo;First Level Decision&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;Second Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. By fax dated March 28, 2012, the applicant applied to the Director of International Tax Services of the CRA for reconsideration of the CRA's decision to deny his request for extension of time to file his 2010 S.216(4) Return (the &ldquo;Second Request&rdquo;). This letter was treated as a request for an administrative review of the First Level Decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. By letter dated April 16, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant that it had received the Second Request and had sent his submission to the Taxpayer Relief Committee for consideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Beryl Hobbs, a Taxpayer Relief Officer of the International Tax Services Office of the CRA, was assigned the task of reviewing the applicant's request for administrative review of the First Level Decision (the &ldquo;Second Level Review&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. During her review of the applicant's Second Request, Ms. Hobbs reviewed and considered the following:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) all records pertaining to the applicant available on the CRA's online computer system;</P1>
<P1>(b) all of the facts as represented by the applicant set out in the paragraphs above; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant's submission that he was undergoing family difficulties, his representative is his father who was 79 years old, and that he believed submitting an NR4 form along with a cheque and letter notifying of his change in status would make him compliant with his S.216(4) obligations.</P1></P>
<P>18. Ms. Hobbs' analysis of the applicant's submission is contained in her report dated July 16, 2012 (the &ldquo;Second Level Report&rdquo;). In summary, she noted the following:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) it was not the applicant's first time for filing a S.216(4) Return as he had filed one for the 2009 taxation year on time;</P1>
<P1>(b) the applicant was notified by letter dated February 9, 2010 advising him of his filing requirements and the deadline of June 30, 2011; and</P1>
<P1>(c) there was no indication of any extraordinary circumstances which prevented the applicant from filing the required return for the 2010 taxation year on time.</P1></P>
<P>19. Based on the above, Ms. Hobbs therefore recommended that the Second Request be denied.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Ms. Hobbs' recommendation to deny relief was reviewed and recommended by the following CRA officers:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) Dragan Milasin, a Team Leader with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Second Level Report dated July 16, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(b) Elaine Whiteman, a Manager with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 16, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(c) Adnan Khan, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Second Level Report dated July 17, 2012;</P1>
<P1>(d) Kathleen Butler, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 20, 2012; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Gillian Pranke, a Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Second Level Report dated July 24, 2012.</P1></P>
<P>21. By letter dated August 23, 2012, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the Second Request for relief (the &ldquo;Second Level Decision&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Judicial Review of the Second Level Decision</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. On January 16, 2013, the applicant made an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the Second Level Decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. On May 5, 2013, the applicant discontinued the application as the respondent agreed to refer the Request for reconsideration by another officer of the CRA not previously involved in the matter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Taxpayer Relief Review Procedure&mdash;Third Level</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. Mr. Peron of the CRA was assigned the task of reviewing the applicant's request for administrative review of the Second Level Decision (the &ldquo;Third Review&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. During his review of the applicant's request, Mr. Peron reviewed and considered, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) all records pertaining to the applicant available on the CRA's online computer system;</P1>
<P1>(b) all of the facts as represented by the applicant set out in the paragraphs above as well as the First Level Decision and Second Level Decision; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant's submission that he was undergoing family difficulties, his representative is his father who was 79 years old, and that he believed submitting an NR4 form along with a cheque and letter notifying of his change in status would make him compliant with his S.216(4) obligations.</P1></P>
<P>26. Mr. Peron's analysis of the applicant's submission is contained in his report dated June 17, 2013 (the &ldquo;Third Level Report&rdquo;). In summary, he noted the following:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) the phone calls the Agent made to the CRA on February 16, 2011 as well as when the applicant returned to Canada in 2011 would not have prompted a CRA phone agent to advise him of the applicant's tax filing requirements unless he volunteered the information that he was collecting rental income as a non-resident. This is because a CRA phone agent would not know the requirements of each taxpayer's specific situation;</P1>
<P1>(b) the applicant not knowing his filing requirements is not a valid reason as per the Self-Assessment Policy;</P1>
<P1>(c) the applicant and his agent were advised of the filing requirement on the NR6 form and the approval letters issued to them when the NR6 was approved;</P1>
<P1>(d) in regards to the divorce and custody battle, the events outlined by the applicant all occurred in the 2010 tax year. He had returned to Canada in 2011 and the S.216(4) Return was due months after the events as described;</P1>
<P1>(e) the applicant stated that when he was in Canada he had to start all over and that his son was traumatized and he needed to focus on that but does not elaborate how this prevented him from filing; and</P1>
<P1>(f) despite the above claims, the applicant filed an immigrant/emigrant income tax return on May 17, 2011 which demonstrated that he was able to file a return during the period, two months prior to the due date for the S.216(4) Return.</P1></P>
<P>27. Based on the above, Mr. Peron therefore recommended that the request for relief be denied.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. Mr. Peron's recommendation to deny relief was reviewed and recommended by the following CRA officers:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>

<P1>(d) Brian Rae, an Assistant Director with the CRA, as evidenced by his signature on the Third Level Report dated July 3, 2013; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Gillian Pranke, a Director with the CRA, as evidenced by her signature on the Third Level Report.</P1></P>
<P>29. By letter dated July 23, 2013, the CRA advised the applicant of its decision to deny the Third Request for relief (the &ldquo;Third Level Decision&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Nicholas Peron, para. 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART II&mdash;POINTS IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>30. The issues in this Application are:
<P1>(a) whether there are grounds to review the Minister's decision not to exercise her discretion to approve the applicant's request for an extension of time to file his Subsection 216(4) Income Tax Return for the 2010 taxation year; and</P1>
<P1>(b) if there is a ground to review, whether the decision is reasonable.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART III&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>NO GROUND TO REVIEW DECISION</TI>
<P>31. In an application for judicial review, section 18.1 of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM> prescribes that this court may only grant relief if it is satisfied that the Minister has committed one of the errors set out in subsection 18.1 (4) of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>:
<QUOTE><PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused to exercise its jurisdiction;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>erred in law in making a decision or an order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(d)</N><PARAP>based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(e)</N><PARAP>acted, or failed to act, by reason of fraud or perjured evidence; or</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(f)</N><PARAP>acted in any other way that was contrary to law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Subsection 18.1(4) of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended [<EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></PARAP></PARA></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. In evaluating whether there is a ground of review under subsection 18.1(4) of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, a reviewing court must consider whether discretion was &ldquo;exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and whether reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[1982] 2 S.C.R. 2</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Maple Lodge</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If a reviewing court concludes that that the above is answered in the affirmative, no reviewable ground exists in respect of the decision and a reviewing court cannot grant relief.</P>
<P>33. A reviewing court is not to substitute its own decision for that of the Minister merely because the court would have exercised the Minister's discretion differently.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 40</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Mugesera</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The court's review is limited to the manner in which the Minister exercised his discretion, and not to reweigh the evidence. A court may intervene and set aside the discretionary decision under review only if that decision was &ldquo;made in bad faith, if its author clearly ignored some relevant facts or took into consideration irrelevant facts or if the decision is contrary to law&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Her Majesty the Queen v. Barron</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>97 D.T.C. 5121</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. On questions of fact, the reviewing court can only intervene if it determines that the Minister based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that the Minister made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Mugesera</EM>, at paras. 38&ndash;40; Paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. In the present case, the Applicant contends that the Minister failed to observe a principle of procedural fairness but does not identify what that principle is. All of the facts raised in the applicant's factum were considered by the Minister, including the circumstances he says prevented him from filing on time. The Applicant has neither pointed to any unreasonable finding of fact on the evidence nor identified any facts that were not considered. The Applicant merely disagrees with the outcome of the review. A disagreement with the decision does not raise a reviewable error.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>STANDARD OF REVIEW</TI>
<P>36. If the reviewing court concludes that a ground of review exists pursuant to subsection 18.1(4) of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, the reviewing court must determine what standard of review it should apply to that decision. There are only two standards of review applicable to judicial reviews of administrative decisions&mdash;correctness and reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>34-35</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On questions of law, the correctness standard will usually be applied. When the decision being reviewed is one of fact, discretion or policy, deference will usually apply automatically and a reasonableness standard will apply.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at paras. 53-54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. In <EM>Sixgraph</EM>, this Court found that the standard of review applicable to subsection 220(3) cases is patent unreasonableness, as the standard existed then.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sixgraph Informatique Lt&ea;e v. Minister of National Revenue</SOC><CITE>2004 FC 759</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed by FCA</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2005 FCA 86</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This points towards the most deferential standard, that of reasonableness today.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>THE MINISTER'S DECISION IS REASONABLE</TI>
<P>38. Subsection 212(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> states that every non-resident shall pay an income tax of 25% on every amount that a person resident in Canada pays or credits to the non-resident person.</P>
<P>39. However, subsection 216(4) allows a non-resident to choose another method of payment if the non-resident undertakes (on prescribed Form NR6) to file within six months after the end of his taxation year an income tax return under Part I instead of Part XIII (a &ldquo;S.216(4) Return&rdquo;). Under subsection 216(4), a Canadian agent would be able to withhold amounts based on the net rental income instead of withholding amounts based on the gross rental income.</P>
<P>40. The applicant chose this option and undertook to file a S.216(4) Return within six months after the end of his 2010 taxation year. He did not do so. Instead, he filed a &ldquo;Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada&rdquo; (a &ldquo;NR4 Form&rdquo;), which he erroneously thought would be sufficient to discharge his subsection 216(4) obligations.</P>
<P><EM>41.</EM> The Applicant seeks to invoke the Minister's discretion under subsection 220(3) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> to grant him an exemption from the fundamental principles of a self-assessing tax system in which the responsibility lies with the taxpayer to ensure that income tax returns are filed. The Canadian income tax system is a self-assessing and self-reporting system that requires taxpayers to file annual returns. It is the duty of taxpayers to comply with the law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 627</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. Further, the extraordinary circumstances which the applicant says prevented him from filing his return on time occurred well before the date on which his return was due.</P>
<P>43. The applicant has sought and obtained three separate reviews of the decision not to extend the time for making a S.216(4) Return. In doing so, the relevant factors and the considerations were taken into account and applied. The Ministerial discretion was appropriately exercised and the decision to decline to extend the time for making a S.216(4) Return was entirely reasonable.</P>
<P>44. The Minister's decision-making process in this case was justifiable, transparent and intelligible. The Minister exercised its statutory discretion in good faith and observed the principles of natural justice, and made a reasonable decision based on the relevant facts and considerations before it. The Applicant was permitted the opportunity to make representations and those representations were fully reviewed and considered by the Minister. The reasons for the Minister's decision were then clearly communicated to the Applicant. The Minister's decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible. Deference should be shown to its decision.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
