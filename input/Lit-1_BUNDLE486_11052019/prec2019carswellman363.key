<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I: OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. This appeal is about the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the administration of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRRSA&rdquo;) and, more specifically, the Independent Assessment Process (&ldquo;IAP&rdquo;) formed pursuant to the IRRSA to compensate residential school survivors who were victims of sexual or severe physical abuse.</P>
<P>2. The appellant, J.W., is a survivor of an Indian Residential School who made an application in the IAP. The adjudicator who heard his claim decided that, while J.W. was a credible witness, and while a supervising nun had indeed grabbed J.W.'s penis and events had occurred as J.W. had described them, he was nevertheless not entitled to compensation pursuant to the IAP Compensation Rules because he failed to prove sexual purpose on the part of the nun.</P>
<P>3. The Honourable Justice Edmond of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench (&ldquo;MBQB&rdquo;), the Supervising Judge for the implementation of the IRRSA in Manitoba, ruled that, by requiring J.W. to prove sexual purpose, the adjudicators' interpretation of the Compensation Rules was &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, <CASEREF><CITE>2016 MBQB 159</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;MBQB&rdquo;) at para. 40 [Record, Tab 4]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, he ordered that J.W.'s case be reconsidered by another adjudicator in accordance with an interpretation of the Compensation Rules that did not require sexual purpose to be proven.</P>
<P>4. On appeal by Canada to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (&ldquo;MBCA&rdquo;), the MBCA decided that the Supervising Judge did not have the jurisdiction to make an Order requiring a reasonable interpretation of the Compensation Rules. Rather, Justice Beard, writing for the MBCA, ruled that the Supervising Judge's supervisory authority is restricted to determining whether the adjudicators had applied the correct compensation category.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, <CASEREF><CITE>2017 MBCA 54</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;MBCA&rdquo;) at para 72 [Record, Tab 6]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. The appellant's position in this appeal is that the MBCA's decision is irreconcilable with the superior court orders that approved and implemented the IRRSA. These orders are meant to ensure that the administration of the IRRSA, including the IAP, results in a delivery to residential school survivors of the benefits they bargained for. The MBCA decision, by contrast, entails that unreasonable interpretations of the Compensation Rules by which claimants are denied the benefits they bargained for are not reviewable by the superior courts.</P>
<P>6. This appeal is also about the Rule of Law. The jurisdiction of the superior courts to supervise the administration of the IAP to ensure that the promises made in the IRRSA are respected cannot be diminished by the superior or appellate courts of the provinces, for that amounts to an abrogation of the Rule of Law.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Statement of Facts</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>(i)</N><TI>History of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and the IAP</TI>
<P>7. The IRSSA is the settlement agreement whereby class actions brought by residential school survivors in several provinces were resolved in principle. The IAP is constituted pursuant to Article Six of the IRRSA which in turn makes reference to Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, which forms part of the IRSSA:
<QUOTE><P>All applications to the IAP which have been delivered prior to the IAP Application Deadline will be processed within IAP as set out in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; of this Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRRSA&rdquo;) at p. 50 [Record, Tab 10]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; lays out the compensation rules by which claims made by residential school survivors respecting sexual and severe physical abuse, and the resulting harms, are to be adjudicated. At page 7 of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, the IRRSA provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Standards for compensable wrongs and for the assessment of compensation have been defined for this IAP. The adjudicator is bound by those standards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the IRRSA (&ldquo;Schedule &lsquo;D&rsquo;&rdquo;) at p. 7 [Record, Tab 11A]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; compensates victims of sexual abuse in proportion with the severity of the sexual abuse inflicted and the harms that resulted from abuse. At page 3 of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, there is a chart which sets out the number of &ldquo;Compensation Points&rdquo; to be awarded based upon categories of sexual abuse&mdash;from the most severe forms of sexual abuse, which are awarded the most &ldquo;Points&rdquo;, to less severe forms of sexual abuse, which are awarded less &ldquo;Points&rdquo;.</P>

<P>13. As explained in more detail below, the superior court orders approving and implementing the IRRSA provide that the IAP is supervised by superior courts. The approval order in Manitoba is found in <CASEREF><SOC>Semple et al v. The Attorney General of Canada et al</SOC><CITE>2006 MBQB 285</CITE></CASEREF>, Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Schulman, Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, December 15, 2006 (&ldquo;Schulman Approval Order&rdquo;) [Record, Tab 8].

<BLOCK4><N>(a)</N><TI><EM>The undisputed facts of J.W.'s case</EM></TI>
<P>14. There is no dispute between the parties about the facts of this case. As a child, J.W., attended an Indian Residential School. While at residential school, on its premises, a nun deliberately grabbed J.W.'s penis while he was in line for the shower. J.W. reacted with embarrassment, as well as anger. He pushed the nun's hand away. When he did this, the nun responded with violence, hurting J.W. by grabbing and twisting his ear.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(b)</N><TI><EM>Hearing Adjudicator's Decision, dated April 7, 2015</EM></TI>
<P>15. J.W. made a claim in the IAP respecting the nun's conduct at the Indian Residential School. He claimed that the actions of the nun constituted compensable abuse under the Compensation Rules of the IAP. In Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; of the Compensation Rules, it is provided that the following conduct is compensable sexual abuse:
<QUOTE><P>Any touching of a student, including touching with an object, by an adult employee or other adult lawfully on the premises which exceeds recognized parental contact and violates the sexual integrity of the student.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; at p. 3 [Record, Tab 11A]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
This category of sexual abuse is, relatively speaking, considered less severe under the Compensation Rules and is awarded a lower number of &ldquo;Points&rdquo;. The category has been referred to as &ldquo;SL1.4&rdquo; in this case.</P>
<P>16. J.W.'s claim in the IAP was heard on May 26, 2014. The Hearing Adjudicator rendered her decision denying J.W.'s claim on April 7, 2015. She concluded that J.W. was a credible witness and that the incident with the nun happened as J.W. described. Nevertheless, the Hearing Adjudicator held that the incident did not constitute compensable sexual abuse because she was not satisfied the nun's act had a sexual purpose.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision in IAP File No. W-15603, dated April 7, 2015 at para. 24 [Record, Tab 1]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Hearing Adjudicator construed the sexual purpose of the perpetrator as a technical requirement for establishing sexual assault in the IAP.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(c)</N><TI><EM>Review Adjudicator's Decision, dated July 5, 2015</EM></TI>
<P>17. J.W. requested that another adjudicator review the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator. On the review, J.W. argued that, by requiring him to establish that his abuser had a sexual purpose, the Hearing Adjudicator misapplied the clear language of the Compensation Rules of IAP Model, specifically, SL1.4 of the Compensation Rules, and thereby failed to properly apply the IAP Model.</P>
<P>18. In his decision, dated July 5, 2015, the Review Adjudicator confirmed the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator and denied that the Hearing Adjudicator had misapplied the IAP Model. The Review Adjudicator did not take issue with the Hearing Adjudicator's requirement that J.W. is required to establish sexual purpose.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Review Decision in IAP File No. W-15603, dated July 5, 2015 at paras. 14-18 and 21-22 [Record, Tab 2]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P>20. In her decision, dated November 22, 2015, the Re-Review Adjudicator affirmed the Review Decision, deciding that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not misapply the IAP Model. The Re-Review Adjudicator concluded that the Reviewing Adjudicator was not mistaken in finding that the sexual motivation of the perpetrator was an essential consideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Re-Review Decision in IAP File No. W-15603, dated November 22, 2015 at p. 5 [Record, Tab 3]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P>21. In addition to the Schulman Approval Order, the Manitoba court, like the other superior courts, made identical approval orders implementing various procedures related to the IRRSA. The Manitoba implementation Order is found in <CASEREF><SOC>Semple et al v. The Attorney General of Canada et al</SOC><CITE>2006 MBQB 285</CITE></CASEREF>, Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Schulman, Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, March 8, 2007 (&ldquo;Schulman Implementation Order&rdquo;), [Record, Tab 9]. Pursuant to the Schulman Implementation Order,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schulman Implementation Order at para. 20 and Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; [Record, Tab 9]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> J.W. made a Request for Direction (&ldquo;RFD&rdquo;) to the judge appointed as Supervising Judge for the IRSSA in Manitoba (by this time, Justice Edmond had succeeded Justice Schulman as the Supervising Judge for Manitoba). J.W. argued that, by failing to correct the misapplication of the IAP Model by the Review Adjudicator, the Re-Review Adjudicator had herself misapplied the IAP Model. J.W. further argued that the plain language of the Compensation Rules does not require&mdash;and in fact excludes&mdash;the requirement to prove sexual purpose on the part of the abuser.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended Request for Direction, dated May 4, 2016 (&ldquo;RFD&rdquo;) at paras. 7&ndash;19 and 22&ndash;25 [Record, Tab 11]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. J.W. requested, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Supervising Judge order that the IAP claim of J.W. be sent back to an adjudicator with the direction that the adjudicator determine whether abuse took place based upon the correct interpretation of SL1.4 and award compensation accordingly, and that the Supervising Judge declare that the determination of whether sexual abuse pursuant to SL1.4 occurred does not require proving sexual purpose.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFD at paras. 27 and 29 [Record, Tab 11]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The Supervising Judge delivered his decision, dated August 3, 2016, reasoning as follows:
<QUOTE><P>I accept that an unreasonable interpretation of SL1.4 could, in fact, amount to a failure to comply with the terms of the IRSSA, if an unreasonable interpretation results in claimants being denied the compensation that the IRSSA intended them to receive.</P>
<P>[40] Accordingly, I find that my jurisdiction in reviewing the substantive decisions of IAP adjudicators is confined to ensuring that the Re -Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation t hat is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case.</P>
<P>[41] Put another way, on the facts of this particular case, the Adjudicator herself found that the only reason J.W.'s claim was not compensable was because it was a &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP that J.W. had to prove that the nun had grabbed his penis for a sexual purpose. If her interpretation of this &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP is not legally tenable, then in my view, it is not reasonable for the Chief Adjudicator to fail to correct that error so as to ensure that the IRSSA has been properly implemented.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 39&ndash;41 [Record, Tab 4]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. The Supervising Judge declared that the Re-Review Adjudicator had failed to properly implement the IRRSA by failing to correct the Hearing Adjudicator's decision that SL1.4 claims could only be compensable if the claimant proved that the perpetrator had a sexual purpose and, further, ordered that J.W.'s claim be sent back to a first-level adjudicator to reconsider J.W.'s claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB, para. 60 [Record, Tab 4]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK5><N>(e.1)</N><TI><EM>Reconsideration Adjudicator's Decision</EM></TI>
<P>25. As a result of the Supervising Judge's decision, the Chief Adjudicator directed a &ldquo;Reconsideration Adjudicator&rdquo; to decide J.W.'s claim in accordance with the Supervising Judge's reasons. The Reconsideration Adjudicator delivered her decision, dated September 30, 2016, awarding compensation to J.W. for the abuse he suffered at the hands of the nun<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reconsideration Decision in IAP File No. W-15603, paras. 48&ndash;51 [Record, Tab 13]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and for the harm that he experienced as a result.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reconsideration Decision in IAP File No. W-15603, paras. 67-68 [Record, Tab 13]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As J.W. was awarded compensation pursuant to a category of sexual abuse at the lower end of the range of Compensation Points, the quantum of his award was relatively modest.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(a)</N><TI><EM>Manitoba Court of Appeal</EM></TI>
<P>26. Before the Reconsideration Decision was implemented (i.e., before the award made by the Reconsideration was paid to J.W.), Canada appealed the decision of the Supervising Judge to the Manitoba Court of Appeal and obtained an Order from the Supervising Judge, dated December 22, 2016, staying the Order he had made sending J.W.'s claim back to an adjudicator for reconsideration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench (Stay Order), dated December 22, 2016 [Record, Tab 14]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. Canada appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal on the grounds that, firstly, the Supervising Judge exceeded his jurisdiction and, secondly, that the Supervising Judge misinterpreted the terms of IRRSA, including the Compensation Rules of the IAP, thereby improperly amending the IRRSA. On May 30, 2017 the MBCA delivered its decision, granting Canada's appeal and reinstating the decision of the Re-Review Adjudicator denying J.W.'s claim, with the result that J.W.'s application for compensation in the IAP was dismissed.</P>
<P>28. In the MBCA Decision, the MBCA reasoned as follows:
<QUOTE><P>In my view, his [the Supervising Judge's] jurisdiction was limited to determining whether the adjudicator implemented the provisions of the IAP in the narrow sense of determining whether she considered the correct terms. Once it was determined that she considered the correct terms, being category SL1.4, his jurisdiction ended and he should have dismissed the RFD. Instead, he considered whether she erred by not properly interpreting that category, which was outside his jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA at para. 72 [Record, Tab 6]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. The narrow supervisory jurisdiction articulated by the MBCA is based, in part, upon its reasoning that the supervising courts cannot conduct a judicial review adjudicator decisions in the IAP. The notion that there is no judicial review of adjudicators' decisions in the IAP appears to have entered the jurisprudence in 2012, when a decision of the Supervising Judge in Ontario was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Schachter</EM>&rdquo;). The Ontario Court of Appeal commented as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The Administrative Judge rejected the suggestion that judicial review of the decision of the Chief Adjudicator is available. He explained... that the Chief Adjudicator acts pursuant to the terms of the implementation orders issued by the court and, therefore, cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision that is subject to judicial review.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Schachter</EM> at para. 30</P1></P>
<P>30. Before the Supervising Judge, J.W. had argued that the Hearing Adjudicator denied compensation to J.W based, firstly, upon an interpretation of SL1.4 that is completely unsupportable on its plain language and, secondly, upon a stark misapplication of the jurisprudence on sexual assault, specifically <CASEREF><SOC>R. v Chase</SOC><CITE>[1987] 2 SCR 293</CITE></CASEREF>. The consequence of the MBCA decision is that, no matter how egregiously an adjudicator misinterprets the Compensation Rules, there is no court review or court supervision available to the IAP claimant denied compensation via the misinterpretation&mdash;as long as the adjudicator has purported to apply the applicable compensation rule.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II: STATEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN ISSUE</UNDER></TI>
<P>31. The MBCA decision in this case raises the following interrelated legal issues:
<P1>(i) Is judicial review of adjudicators' decisions in the IAP available to claimants who have been unreasonably denied compensation and, if so, what is the applicable standard of review?</P1>
<P1>(ii) Is there any general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review of administrative tribunals that are formed pursuant to the terms of a settlement in a class proceeding?</P1>
<P1>(iii) In the event that no judicial review of IAP decisions is available and judicial supervision of IAP decisions is restricted to the basis set out in <EM>Schachter</EM>, is there &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; for a claimant who was denied compensation based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA?</P1>
<P1>(iv) Does the IRRSA and its implementation engage the honour of the Crown?</P1>
<P1>(v) Was the MBCA correct when it held that claimants whose IAP claims are denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRRSA have no recourse to the courts supervising the administration of the IRSSA?</P1></P>
<P>32. The appellant submits that all of the foregoing issues are plainly issues of law, and therefore subject to the standard of review of correctness.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>PART III: ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The IAP is a creature of statute, agreement and court order</TI>
<P>33. There are two interrelated grounds that support the appellant's position that judicial review of the administrative tribunal in the IAP is available. The first ground is <EM>The Class Proceedings Act</EM>, C.C.S.M. c. C130 of Manitoba which, in section 12, provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>12 The court may at any time make any order that it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of a class proceeding to ensure its fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose on one or more of the parties the terms it considers appropriate.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Class Proceedings Act</EM>, C.C.S.M. c. C130 of Manitoba (&ldquo;<EM>CPA</EM>&rdquo;), s. 12</P1>
This section grants robust jurisdiction to the courts to ensure the fairness of the determination of a class proceeding &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;.</P>
<P>34. Furthermore, section 35 of the <EM>CPA</EM> provides as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>35.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>A class proceeding may be settled, discontinued or abandoned only
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>with the approval of the court; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>on the terms the court considers appropriate.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>A settlement may be concluded in relation to the common issues affecting a subclass only
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>with the approval of the court; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>on the terms the court considers appropriate.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>CPA</EM>, s. 35</P1></P>
<P>35. Secondly, the superior courts that approved the IRRSA as a settlement of the class actions brought by residential school survivors set out the terms upon which the IRRSA was approved in judgments that incorporated identical approval orders, including the following terms:
<QUOTE><P>12. THIS COURT ORDERS that the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and which is expressly incorporated by reference into this judgment, including the definitions included therein, is hereby approved and shall be implemented, in accordance with this judgment and any further order of this Court.</P>
<P>13. THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that this Court shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment.</P>
<P>31. THIS COURTS DECLARES that the Representative Plaintiffs, Defendants, Released Church Organizations, Class Counsel, the National Administration Committee, or the Trustee, or such other person or entity as this Court may allow, after fully exhausting the dispute resolution mechanisms contemplated in the Agreement, may apply to the Court for directions in respect of the implementation, administration or amendment of the Agreement or the implementation of this judgment on notice to all affected parties, all in conformity with the terms of the Agreement.</P>
<P>36. THIS COURT DECLARES that the provisions of the applicable class proceedings law shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of the Agreement and this judgment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schulman Approval Order, paras. 12-13, 31 and 36 [Record, Tab 8]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. Per paragraph 36 of the Schulman Approval Order, quoted immediately above, the provisions of the <EM>CPA</EM> &ldquo;shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of this Agreement [IRRSA].&rdquo; Recall that s. 12 of the <EM>CPA</EM> provides that &ldquo;the court may at any time make any order that it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of a class proceeding to ensure its fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose on one or more of the parties the terms it considers appropriate.&rdquo; Paragraph 36 of the Schulman Approval Order makes s. 12 of the <EM>CPA</EM> applicable to the implementation of the IRRSA. The Schulman Approval Order therefore orders that the Supervising Judge in Manitoba may make orders to ensure that the IAP is operated and implemented fairly.</P>
<P>37. It is noteworthy that, in the later Schulman Implementation Order, there is a Preamble which states, in one of its recitals, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>AND UPON hearing further and supplementary submissions from counsel for the parties, reading the supplementary materials filed by the parties, and having regard for the steps required to oversee the implementation of the Agreement pursuant to this court's supervisory jurisdiction pursuant to the applicable class proceedings law and its inherent jurisdiction to control its own process, in order to ensure the Agreement is administered in a fair and impartial manner and to assist the Courts in their supervision over implementation of and administration of the Agreement...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schulman Implementation Order, p. 3 [Record, Tab 9]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
Here, the supervisory authority of the superior courts to ensure the continued implementation of the IRRSA in a fair manner is also grounded in the court's &ldquo;inherent jurisdiction to control its own processes&rdquo;.</P>
<P>38. The appellant submits that the IAP is not simply the creature of the IRRSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Note that he IRRSA itself provides that it &ldquo;will not be effective unless and until it is approved by the Courts&rdquo;. See IRRSA at section 4.11 and 4.09(4) [Record, Tab 10]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, as explained above, the IAP is a <EM>hybrid</EM> creation of statute, court order, and agreement: The Schulman Approval Order by which the IRRSA was approved provides explicitly that the IRRSA is incorporated by reference into that Order, and &ldquo;that the provisions of the applicable class proceedings law shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of the Agreement and this judgment.&rdquo;</P>
<P>39. The supervising courts in the provinces have commented on the role of the courts. In the Ontario Superior Court decision approving the IRSSA, <CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2006] O.J. No. 4968</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>83 OR (3d) 481</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Baxter&rdquo;), Justice Winkler reasoned as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The court has an obligation under the <EM>Class Proceedings Act</EM>, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (&ldquo;CPA&rdquo;) to protect the interests of the absent class members, both in determining whether the settlement meets the test for approval and in ensuring that the administration and implementation of the settlement are done in a manner that delivers the promised benefits to the class members. In seeking the approval of the court, the plaintiffs and defendants essentially seek the benefits of having the court sanction the settlement. Such approval cannot be divorced from the obligation it entails. Once the court is engaged, it cannot abdicate its responsibilities under the CPA.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Baxter</EM> at para. 12</P1></P>
<P>40. In a later decision of the Administrative Judge for the IAP in Western Canada, in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE></CASEREF>, Madam Justice Brown articulated the responsibility of the supervising courts in language that echoes <EM>Baxter</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>The court supervision aims to ensure that legitimate claims are compensated to the full extent available under the settlement terms and that the process by which those claims are adjudicated has the integrity, impartiality and transparency expected of any other court process.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>41. On these delineations of the judicial supervision function of the supervising courts, not only is judicial supervision of the courts available to claimants who have been denied delivery of the benefits promised in the IRRSA, the courts are &ldquo;obligated&rdquo; to supervise the settlement to ensure that such delivery is made. However, these judicial interpretations of the court's supervisory responsibility by the supervising courts in Ontario and British Columbia are inconsistent with the reasoning of the MBCA.</P>
<P>42. This Court has recently confirmed the supervisory jurisdiction of superior courts over the implementation of the IRRSA, in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 47</CITE></CASEREF>, noting that the supervising courts have &ldquo;a vital role&rdquo;, &ldquo;broad powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;must have generous discretion&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 47</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;SCC Records Decision&rdquo;), paras. 31 and 32</P1></P>
<P>43. The SCC Records Decision also grounds the supervisory courts' authority over the implementation of the IRRSA in the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts:
<QUOTE><P>Further, in any instance where the scope of superior courts' powers granted by class action legislation does not expressly contemplate certain supervisory functions, superior courts retain residual supervisory powers under their inherent jurisdiction. Removing the inherent jurisdiction of superior courts requires &ldquo;clear and precise statutory language&rdquo; (<CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Rose</SOC><CITE>[1998] 3 S.C.R. 262</CITE><PARANUM>133</PARANUM></CASEREF>; see also Endean, at paras. 24, 56 and 60).</P></QUOTE>
<P1>SCC Records Decision, para. 33</P1></P>
<P>44. The appellant's position is that, even if the availability of judicial review cannot be grounded in the court orders approving and implementing the IRRSA and the class proceedings statutes, it is nevertheless firmly grounded in the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts, which, as the Supreme Court has confirmed, has not been ousted by the settlement of the residential schools class action.</P>
<P>45. The appellant's view is that the ouster of the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts to review IAP decisions&mdash;if it is possible at all&mdash;would have to occur by explicit terms ousting its jurisdiction and by the explicit approval of such terms by the superior courts themselves.</P>
<P>46. The Chief Adjudicator appears to agree with the appellant that the IAP is an administrative tribunal and that it is subject, in some respects, to Canadian administrative law. In a document titled &ldquo;The Chief Adjudicator's Responsibility to Promote Consistency, Coherence and Quality in IAP Decisions&rdquo;, dated June 2009 and found presently on the IAP Adjudication Secretariat's website, Chief Adjudicator Daniel Ish, as he then was, explained:
<QUOTE><P>The purpose of this document is to review the responsibility of the Chief Adjudicator to develop and implement mechanisms to promote coherence, consistency and quality in decisions rendered by adjudicators in the Independent Assessment Process. The IAP contemplates such a role for the Chief Adjudicator (CA) as do the principles of law applied to administrative tribunals, one of which the Settlement Agreement has created by providing for a cadre of adjudicators overseen by a Chief Adjudicator. As with other administrative tribunals, the IAP was &ldquo;created to increase the efficiency of the administration of justice and... called upon to handle heavy caseloads&rdquo;. (<CASEREF><SOC>IWA v. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1990 Can LII 132</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>).</P>
<P>This document will first outline the need for internal mechanisms, including internal review mechanisms, and the practice that has evolved within the IAP. It will also review the general principles of administrative law that are applicable to administrative tribunals in implementing internal mechanisms and making allowance for consultation by individual adjudicators with colleagues, legal counsel and staff.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;The Chief Adjudicator's Responsibility to Promote Consistency, Coherence and Quality in IAP Decisions&rdquo; (June 2009)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
Throughout this paper, Chief Adjudicator Ish, as he then was, refers to the IAP as an &ldquo;administrative tribunal&rdquo;, and he applies general principles of administrative law to the IAP.</P>
<P>47. There are other references to the IAP as an administrative tribunal which may be found presently on the Adjudication Secretariat's website. In his introduction to the Adjudication Secretariat's Annual Report of 2009, Chief Adjudicator Dan Ish, as he then was, refers to the IAP as an &ldquo;administrative tribunal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat 2009 Annual Report&rdquo; (at pp. 3, 4 and 12<BOLD>)</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, in an &ldquo;IAP Fact Sheet&rdquo; on the &ldquo;IAP and Self-Represented Claimants&rdquo;, dated March 2014 and found presently on the Adjudication Secretariat's website, the IAP is again described as &ldquo;an administrative tribunal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;IAP Fact Sheets: IAP and Self-Represented Claimants&rdquo; (March 2014)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>The Rule of Law</TI>
<P>48. In her concurring reasons in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF>, Justice Deschamps articulated the constitutional basis of judicial review in Canada:
<QUOTE><P>By virtue of the Constitution, superior courts are the only courts that possess inherent jurisdiction. They are responsible both for applying the laws enacted by Parliament and the legislatures and for insuring that statutory bodies respect their legal boundaries. Parliament and the legislatures cannot totally exclude judicial oversight without overstepping the division between legislative or executive powers and judicial powers. Superior courts are, in the end, the protectors of the integrity of the rule of law and the justice system. Judicial review of administrative action is rooted in these fundamental principles and its boundaries are largely informed by the roles of the respective branches of government.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>&rdquo;), para. 159</P1></P>
<P>49. The appellant's position is that, viewed correctly, the administrative tribunal of the IAP is a hybrid creation of statute, agreement and court order. Its &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo;&mdash;in the sense of Justice Deschamp in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>&mdash;must be drawn by reference to, on the one hand, the specific terms of the IRRSA, including the Compensation Rules in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; and, on the other hand, the specific provisions of the superior court approval orders and the class proceedings statutes of the provinces.</P>
<P>50. Nothing in the IRRSA or the Schulman Approval Order requires or implies an exclusion of the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts, including the jurisdiction to control their own processes. Nor is there any basis for the suggestion that court supervision of the IAP must be on some exotic, <EM>sui generis</EM> standard of review&mdash;or &ldquo;recourse&rdquo;&mdash;that is outside of scope of <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> and administrative law. In view of the jurisprudence following <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, it is unnecessary for the courts to fashion a <EM>sui generis</EM> and <EM>ad hoc</EM> basis for judicial review in the IAP.</P>
<P>51. In <CASEREF><SOC>Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers' Association</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 61</CITE></CASEREF>, this Court explained that, <EM>post-Dunsmuir</EM>, reasonableness is the presumptively applicable standard of review:
<QUOTE><P>When considering a decision of an administrative tribunal interpreting or applying its home statute, it should be presumed that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers' Association</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 61</CITE><PARANUM>39</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>52. The appellant submits that, for the purpose of applying this authority to the administrative tribunal of the IAP, the IRRSA (including Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;), in conjunction with the superior court approval orders and the applicable class actions statute should be considered as the analogue of the &ldquo;home statute&rdquo; of other administrative tribunals. Accordingly, the administrative tribunal of the IAP is interpreting the analogue of its &ldquo;home statute&rdquo;, and the reasonableness standard applies.</P>
<P>53. If the reasonableness standard does not apply presumptively, then the factors to be applied are articulated in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[55] A consideration of the following factors will lead to the conclusion that the decision maker should be given deference and a reasonableness test applied:
<ITEM><P>A privative clause: this is a statutory direction from Parliament or a legislature indicating the need for deference.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>A discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision maker has special expertise (labour relations for instance).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The nature of the question of law. A question of law that is of &ldquo;central importance to the legal system . . . and outside the . . . specialized area of expertise&rdquo; of the administrative decision maker will always attract a correctness standard (<CASEREF><SOC>Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E.</SOC></CASEREF>, at para. 62). On the other hand, a question of law that does not rise to this level may be compatible with a reasonableness standard where the two above factors so indicate.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>[56] If these factors, considered together, point to a standard of reasonableness, the decision maker's decision must be approached with deference in the sense of respect discussed earlier in these reasons. There is nothing unprincipled in the fact that some questions of law will be decided on the basis of reasonableness. It simply means giving the adjudicator's decision appropriate deference in deciding whether a decision should be upheld, bearing in mind the factors indicated.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Dunsmuir</EM> at paras. 55-56</P1></P>
<P>54. There is, in the IRRSA, one provision which excludes access court supervision in very limited circumstances. As part of Article Four governing the administration of the IRRSA, Section 4.10 constitutes the National Administration Committee (&ldquo;NAC&rdquo;), which is composed of counsels representing parties to the Agreement. The NAC is tasked with supervising several aspects of the implementation of the IRRSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRRSA at section 4.11 and 4.09(4) [Record, Tab 10]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. At 4.11(9) to 4.11(11) of the IRRSA, the decision-making procedure of the NAC is constituted as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(9) Decisions of the NAC will be made by consensus and where consensus can not be reached, a majority of five (5) of the seven (7) members is required to make any decision. In the event that a majority of five (5) members can not be reached the dispute may be referred by a simple majority of four (4) NAC members to the Appropriate Court in the jurisdiction where the dispute arose by way of reference styled as <CASEREF><SOC>In Re Residential Schools</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>(10) Notwithstanding Section 4.11(9), where a vote would increase the costs of the Approval Orders whether for compensation or procedural matters, the representative for Canada must be one (1) of the five (5) member majority.</P>
<P>(11) There will not be reference to the Courts for any dispute arising under Section 4.11(10).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRRSA at sections 4.11(9) to 4.11(11) [Record, Tab 10]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>56. Apart from these provisions on a very specific detail of the procedure of one committee created by the IRRSA&mdash;which shows that the parties did turn their minds to the exclusion of access to the courts&mdash;there is no privative clause, nor any provision or clause analogous to a privative clause to be found anywhere in the governing class proceeding statute, in the IRRSA, or in the approval and implementation orders of the superior courts which would purport to remove the jurisdiction of the superior courts to review the decisions of adjudicators in the IAP. In fact, as we have seen, the <EM>CPA</EM> approval and implementation orders explicitly provide for the ongoing supervision by the courts of the administration of the IAP. On its own, the &ldquo;privative clause&rdquo; factor would tend to support a relatively low level of deference to decisions in the IAP.</P>
<P>57. The appellant acknowledges, however, that the IAP is a discrete and special administrative regime wherein adjudicators have special expertise. This specialization, and the existence, within the IAP, of one level of review where palpable and overriding errors are alleged, and two levels of review where the proper application of the IAP Model is at issue would tend to support some deference. It may be observed, however, that the adjudicators of the IAP are not required to have expertise specifically in the area of criminal law, which was at issue before the Supervising Judge in J.W.'s case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 49&ndash;54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. While the adjudicators' application of criminal law jurisprudence, as in J.W.'s claim, is outside their specialized area of expertise, it is unclear whether J.W.'s application for court review raises a question of law that is of central importance to the legal system.</P>
<P>59. It is the appellant's view that, even if the reasonableness standard do es not apply presumptively, the <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> factors taken together tend to support some deference and, therefore, judicial review of IAP decisions should be on the standard of reasonableness.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><EM>Schachter</EM></TI>
<P>60. The appellant is unaware of any authority or any rule of law that prevents the judicial review of decisions of administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions pursuant to the <EM>CPA</EM>, or the class proceedings statutes of other provinces. However, such a rule against judicial review seems to have been introduced into the jurisprudence on the judicial supervision of the IRRSA. When it comes to the denial of judicial review of IAP decisions, all roads lead to <EM>Schachter</EM>.</P>
<P>61. The reasoning for the denial of judicial review in the IAP is articulated in <EM>Schachter</EM> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Judicial review is not available to review the exercise of authority by a judicially created body, which has been given certain duties as provided by the terms of the S.A. and the implementation orders. The office of the Chief Adjudicator was created by order of the courts in approving the negotiated terms of settlement of class action litigation. The authority of that office is exercised in relation to those class members who have elected to advance claims through the IAP and their counsel. The terms of the S.A. and the implementation orders set out the process for reviewing decisions of the IAP Adjudicators. Recourse to the courts is only available if it is provided for in the S.A. or the implementation orders.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Schachter</EM>, at para. 52</P1></P>
<P>62. With respect, the appellant submits that, in this passage of <EM>Schachter</EM>, the rule against judicial review is simply asserted, without the citation of any authority for the rule and without any persuasive reasoning for it. Why is judicial review of the exercise of authority by a judicially created body &ldquo;not available&rdquo;? What about the inherent jurisdiction of the superior court, including the jurisdiction to control its own processes? How does the formation of the IAP negate the possibility of judicial review? Why is the supervisory authority set out in the approval orders, namely, the authority to make such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the IRRSA, inadequate to ground the judicial review of IAP decisions for reasonableness? There appear to be no answers to these questions in <EM>Schachter</EM>.</P>
<P>63. If the jurisprudential foundation and reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM> are, as the appellant respectfully maintain, deficient, then it may be helpful to recall that <EM>Schachter</EM> can be sharply distinguished on the facts: J.W. was denied compensation in his IAP claim based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA; whereas, the court application to the supervising court in <EM>Schachter</EM> was made by a lawyer who thought he should receive more legal fees from his client in the IAP.</P>
<P>64. <EM>Schachter</EM> upheld the decision of Winkler CJO, the then Eastern Administrative Judge, who reasoned as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Judicial review may be available where a statutory power of decision has been exercised by an inferior tribunal, but a superior court does not judicially review its own order. Here, where the Chief Adjudicator is acting pursuant to a term of the orders issued by superior courts, he cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision subject to judicial review.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (AG)</SOC><JUDGDATE>7 March 2011</JUDGDATE><DOCKET>File No. 00-CV-192059CP</DOCKET><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Direction) (&ldquo;Schachter ONSC&rdquo;), at para. 19</P1>
The reasoning here seems to be: If a court were to conduct a judicial review of a decision in the IAP, it would, in effect, be reviewing its own approval and/or implementation orders.</P>
<P>65. With respect, the appellant says that an IAP decision which denies relief to a claimant based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA cannot be identified with the court orders approving and implementing the IRRSA. To identify the court orders with the IAP decisions is to collapse the critical distinction between them which is required for <EM>any</EM> supervisory role the superior courts may be said to have. Moreover, if the superior courts are to fulfill their purpose, per <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, of protecting the integrity of the justice system, they cannot be categorically prevented from reviewing the unreasonable decisions of administrative tribunals on the obscure premise that there is no distinction between their orders and the decisions of those tribunals.</P>
<P>66. <EM>Schachter</EM> restricts court supervision in a manner that is untenable in view of the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts; the provincial class proceedings statute; the court orders approving the IRRSA; the reasons of court decisions approving the IRRSA and the non-existence of any rule of law preventing the judicial review of the decisions of administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions.</P>
<P>67. The Supervising Judge ruled that the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator in J.W.'s case was based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the Compensation Rules that form part of the IRRSA and further, that the Re-review Adjudicator had failed to correct this unreasonable interpretation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 42&ndash;58</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> More specifically, he found that the adjudicators' interpretation of SL1.4 was inconsistent with its plain language.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 44&ndash;48</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He also concluded that the adjudicators applied <EM>Chase</EM> to require a &ldquo;sexual purpose&rdquo; on the part of the alleged abuser; whereas, <EM>Chase</EM> actually provides the opposite: That the sexual purpose of the abuser is only one factor to be considered, and not a requirement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 49&ndash;53</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>68. However, the Supervising Judge did not purport to make his decision based upon an application of the ordinary reasonableness standard in a judicial review, as articulated in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>. Rather, the Supervising Judge reasoned that he was following <EM>Schachter</EM>. It is the appellant's view that the standard of review actually applied by the Supervising Judge is reconcilable with the <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> standard of reasonableness.</P>
<P>69. The Supervising Judge in Manitoba in this case concluded as follows respecting the standard of review:
<QUOTE><P>I find that my jurisdiction in reviewing the essential decisions of IAP adjudicators is confined to ensuring that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case... Put another way, on the facts of this particular case, the Adjudicator herself found that the only reason J.W.'s claim was not compensable was because it was a &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP that J.W. had to prove that the nun had grabbed his penis for a sexual purpose. If her interpretation of this &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP is not legally tenable, then in my view, it is not reasonable for the Chief Adjudicator to fail to correct that error so as to ensure that the IRSSA has been properly implemented.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at paras. 40-41</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>70. The MBCA construes the foregoing reasoning as tantamount to a resurrection of the patently unreasonable standard from the pre-<EM>Dunsmuir</EM> jurisprudence.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA at paras. 56-57</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appellant's position is that, in spite of the denial that he is performing an ordinary judicial review, the reasoning of the Supervising Judge may be accurately characterized as an application of the reasonableness standard that is contextually appropriate, when the question at issue is the interpretation of a provision in a settlement agreement by an adjudicator specializing in the interpretation of said agreement.</P>
<P>71. In <CASEREF><SOC>Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers' Association</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 61</CITE></CASEREF>, this court has ruled out the notion that there may be degrees of deference within the reasonableness standard:
<QUOTE><P>Once it is determined that a review is to be conducted on a reasonableness standard, there is no second assessment of how intensely the review is to be conducted. The judicial review is simply concerned with the question at issue. A review of a question of statutory interpretation is different from a review of the exercise of discretion. Each will be governed by the context. But there is no determination of the intensity of the review with some reviews closer to a correctness review and others not.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers' Association</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 61</CITE><PARANUM>47</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>72. The appellant submits that, in determining that the Hearing Adjudicator's decision was insupportable by the plain language of the settlement agreement, and by noting the failure of the Re-review decision to correct the Hearing Adjudicator's decision, the Supervising Judge was not applying a less &ldquo;intense&rdquo; mode of review. Rather, the Supervising Judge conducted a review that was governed by the context of the specialized administrative tribunal and the question at issue.</P>
<P>73. If the appellant is mistaken in construing the Supervising Judge's decision as reconcilable with a <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> reasonableness review, then the appellant says that the level of scrutiny applied by the Supervising Judge was too low, rather than too high. It is, moreover, arguable that it is the MBCA itself that articulates a variation on the patently unreasonable standard by requiring an adjudicator's decision to be unreasonable to the extent of involving the application of an incorrect compensation category before the supervisory authority of court is engaged.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>(i)</N><TI>2012 to 2016: Court review of IAP decisions continues</TI>
<P>74. The administrative tribunal of the IAP operated for several years before <EM>Schachter</EM>. There appears to be no evidence of a flood of judicial review applications to the supervising courts during this period. There are two phases of the post-<EM>Schachter</EM> jurisprudence of the supervising and appellate courts. The first phase, from 2012 to 2016, is characterized by supervising court decisions that continue to make determinations about the reasonableness of adjudicator decisions in the IAP, notwithstanding <EM>Schachter</EM>.</P>
<P>75. For example, in the 2014 decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF>, Justice Schulman, the then supervising judge for Manitoba, interpreted <EM>Schachter</EM> as being consistent with his own jurisdiction to provide &ldquo;the court's assistance in assuring that the terms of the agreement [IRRSA] are not abrogated.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Resident's Decision&rdquo;) at para. 51</P1></P>
<P>76. It is noteworthy that the potential &ldquo;abrogation&rdquo; at issue in that case involved a misinterpretation of the language of the IRRSA by which a claimant in the IAP had been denied compensation.
<P1>Resident's Decision at paras. 65&ndash;68</P1></P>
<P>77. In applying <EM>Schachter</EM>, Justice Schulman reasoned that the Request for Direction process provided for in the Schulman Implementation Order &ldquo;is not an appeal or a traditional judicial review of the Chief Adjudicator's decision, but rather a mechanism designed to ensure that the terms of the Settlement Agreement are properly implemented.&rdquo;
<P1>Resident's Decision at para. 54</P1></P>
<P>78. Nevertheless, in spite of purporting to follow <EM>Schachter</EM>, when he carried out his non traditional judicial review, Justice Schulman proceeded to establish reasonableness as the appropriate standard of review. Canada did not appeal the Residents Decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The MBCA rejected the reasoning of the Residents Decision of Justice Schulman (MBCA Decision, paras. 65&ndash;68)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>Resident's Decision, paras. 54&ndash;56</P1></P>
<P>79. In the 2016 decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Spanish Decision&rdquo;), the supervising judge for Ontario acknowledged that the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule was binding upon him and that it precluded judicial review in the usual sense. Nevertheless, he interpreted <EM>Schachter</EM> as providing for a &ldquo;means to review the decisions of the Chief Adjudicator&rdquo;, which he construed as &ldquo;a curial review jurisdiction&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE><PARANUM>43 and 41</PARANUM></CASEREF>, overturned in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 26</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>80. The 2016 decision of the Supervising Judge for Manitoba in J.W.'s Request for Direction falls within this line of post-<EM>Schachter</EM> cases, inasmuch as the Supervising Judge determined that the form of court review available to IAP claimants is consistent with his determination of a standard review.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>(ii)</N><TI>November 2016 to 2017: Closing the door</TI>
<P>81. In November of 2016, in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Bundled RFDs&rdquo;), Madam Justice Brown of the B.C. Supreme Court disagreed with the reasoning of the supervising judge of Ontario in the Spanish Decision:
<QUOTE><P>the phrase &ldquo;curial review&rdquo; suggests a right to seek review before the Courts and a standard of review, both of which are untenable given the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <EM>Shachter</EM> [<EM>sic</EM>].</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE><PARANUM>177</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>82. When the Spanish Decision was overturned in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 26</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Spanish Appeal&rdquo;), the Ontario Court of Appeal explicitly endorsed the B.C. court's rejection of the reasoning of the Ontario supervising judge.
<P1>Spanish Appeal at para. 52</P1></P>
<P>83. In comparison with the three post-<EM>Schachter</EM> decisions in the years immediately following the <EM>Schachter</EM>&mdash;in which a form or court review and the notion of a standard of review survived&mdash;the 2017 Spanish Appeal decision overturning the supervising court's Spanish Decision represents a narrowing of the superior courts' supervisory jurisdiction. However, notwithstanding the rejection of the applicability of a &ldquo;standard of re view&rdquo; to decisions in the IAP, the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Spanish Appeal refers favourably to the decision of the Manitoba supervising judge in the within leave application.
<P1>Spanish Appeal at para. 54</P1></P>
<P>84. There has not been a consistent application of <EM>Schachter</EM> to preclude court review of IAP decisions. In the years immediately following <EM>Schachter</EM>, reasonableness review of adjudicator decisions survived. However, as time passed, access to the supervising courts became more restricted.</P>
<P>85. The MBCA decision closes the door to the supervising courts even more than the Bundled RFDs and Spanish Appeal decisions, with a construal of the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule that seems to confine &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; to a very specific mode of non-compliance with the terms of the IRRSA whereby adjudicators would categorically fail to apply the applicable compensation rule. This very narrowly defined recourse cannot be reconciled with the reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM> that &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; is meant &ldquo;to ensure that the bargain to which they [the parties] consented is respected&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Schachter</EM> at para. 57</P1></P>
<P>86. It appears that, in argument before the B.C. supervising court, Canada has acknowledged that the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision in J.W.'s case modifies <EM>Schachter</EM>, as explained in the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1633</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Bundled RFDs #3&rdquo;):
<QUOTE><P>Canada agreed that in <EM>Reo</EM> [i.e., in MBCA], the Manitoba Court of Appeal appears to have modified the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold by narrowing the circumstances in which judicial recourse is available. Canada urged this court to adopt this modified standard and to conclude that neither Requestor met the standard.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Bundled RFDs #3 at para. 63</P1></P>
<P>87. Justice Brown reasoned that it was not necessary, in the case before her, to determine whether the MCA's decision narrowed the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold; however, she acknowledged that &ldquo;it is arguable in <EM>Reo</EM>, the Manitoba Court of Appeal reformulated the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, narrowing the circumstances in which judicial recourse can be invoked&rdquo;.

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>The MBCA decision is inconsistent with <EM>Schachter</EM></TI>
<P>88. For the reasons articulated above, it is the appellant's position that it was a mistake to introduce a rule against judicial review in the IAP. None of the reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM>, or in the MBCA Decision establishes that the parties to the IRRSA or the superior courts that approved the IRSSA intended to insulate decisions made by adjudicators in the IAP from judicial review. Moreover, the language of the orders approving the IRRSA indicates th e contrary. However, if the appellants are mistaken in holding that decisions in the IAP should be subject to judicial review, then the appellant nevertheless submits that the MBCA decision, with its result that J.W.'s IAP claim is dismissed, should be set aside on the grounds that it misapplies the <EM>Schachter</EM> test for judicial recourse in the IAP.</P>
<P>89. As we have seen, <EM>Schachter</EM> allows for judicial recourse in cases where the Re-review adjudicator's decision reflects a failure to comply with the terms of the IRRSA or the court orders. However, the MBCA decision erroneously restricts a failure to <UNDER>comply</UNDER> with the terms of the IRRSA to a failure to <UNDER>apply</UNDER> the terms of the IRRSA, in the narrow sense of failing &ldquo;to consider the correct terms&rdquo;. The appellant's position is that, if the adjudicator has interpreted the Compensation Rules of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;&mdash;which form part of the IRRSA&mdash;in a manner which completely subverts the plain language of those Rules, the he or she has not <UNDER>complied</UNDER> with the IRRSA in a meaningful sense.</P>
<P>90. According to the MBCA Decision, even the most untenable interpretation of the Compensation Rules by an IAP adjudicator can be said to &ldquo;comply&rdquo; with the IRRSA, and be insulated from judicial supervision, provided only that the adjudicator has purported to apply, or &ldquo;consider&rdquo; the applicable compensation rule. The appellant's position is that this is, at best, a sort of empty, formalistic sense of &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; that is not supported in the language of the approval orders&mdash;and certainly not supported by a purposive interpretation of the approval orders.</P>
<P>91. As we have seen, the approval orders require that the courts &ldquo;shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment&rdquo;. This language requires the superior courts to supervise the implementation of the IRRSA for <UNDER>meaningful</UNDER> compliance.</P>
<P>92. And where the issue is the meaningful compliance of adjudicators with the provisions of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, in particular the adjudicators' compliance with the Compensation Rules of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, an evaluation of reasonableness of the adjudicators' interpretation of the Compensation Rules will be inescapable.</P>
<P>93. However, if the appellant is mistaken that court supervision is supervision for meaningful compliance, then the appellant submits that the MBCA decision is still mistaken in holding that the adjudicators applied the correct provisions of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; i n adjudicating J.W.'s IAP claim. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Standards for compensable wrongs and for the assessment of compensation have been defined for this IAP. The adjudicator is bound by those standards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; at p. 7 [Record, Tab 11A]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>94. In his submissions to the Supervising Judge, J.W. argued that the adjudicators had failed to give effect to the clause of the compensation rule in SL1.4 that refers to touching &ldquo;which exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RFD at para. 14(b) [Record, Tab 11]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supervising Judge took up this submission when he reasoned that the adjudicators' interpretation of SL1.4 in J.W.'s claim implied that there could be sexual touching of a child that is within the bounds of recognized parental contact. But that implication, as the Supervising Judge notes, is clearly absurd.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB at para. 45</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>95. It is not consistent with the IRRSA's rule that adjudicators must be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by its standards for compensable wrongs to subvert those standards via an absurd interpretation of them. It follows that, by failing to be bound by the standards for compensable wrongs, as required by Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, the adjudicators in J.W.'s case failed to apply an applicable provision of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the IRRSA.</P>
<P>96. While the appellant submits that the Re-review Adjudicator's decision in his claim should be overturned even pursuant to the very narrow &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; articulated in the MBCA decision, the more significant result of the foregoing analysis is that the reasonableness standard is inescapable. Even judicial supervision that would purport only to determine whether an adjudicator has considered the correct terms of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; runs into the requirement of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; itself that adjudicators are &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by the Compensation Rules.</P>
<P>97. To be bound by rules is not to make an empty gesture of applying them, or to apply them in an irrational or absurd way. To be bound by rules means to follow them in a reasonable fashion. Consequently, even pursuant to the MBCA decision, supervising courts have the jurisdiction to determine whether a claimant was denied compensation by an interpretation that is inconsistent with the adjudicator's obligation under the IRRSA to be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by the rules&mdash;that is, to follow the rules reasonably.</P>
<P>98. Reasonableness is inescapable in a larger sense, inasmuch as any determination of whether a correct rule has been considered will require an analysis of the meaning of the rule in order to determine whether it was the rule that was considered, or some absurd interpretation in the guise of the rule.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>The Court of Appeal failed to show deference to the Supervising Judge</TI>
<P>99. In the SCC Records Decision, this Court set down a deferential standard for appellate court reviews of the decisions of the supervising judges of the superior courts:
<QUOTE><P>As for the supervising judge's decision to order destruction of the IAP Documents held by Canada following a 15-year retention period, a deferential standard is also appropriate. As explained above, supervisory courts have wide discretion to make appropriate orders to ensure the fair and expeditious determination of class proceedings. Such decisions are afforded deference on review (<CASEREF><SOC>Lavier v. MyTravel Canada Holidays Inc.</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 92</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>359 D. L.R. (4th) 713</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>). As regards the exercise of discretion, &ldquo;[a]ppellate intervention is warranted only if the judge has clearly misdirected himself or herself on the facts or the law, proceeded arbitrarily, or if the decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice&rdquo; (<CASEREF><SOC>P.

As this Court has said, where the judge at first instance has given sufficient weight to all relevant considerations and the exercise of discretion is not based on an erroneous principle, appellate reviewers must generally defer (<CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v.

<P1>SCC Records Decision, at para. 36</P1></P>
<P>100. The <EM>Schachter</EM> decision was not binding on the Manitoba Supervising Judge in this case. Nevertheless, the Supervising Judge considered the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule that &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; is available when an adjudicator fails to comply with the terms IRRSA, In the Supervising Judge's view, a misinterpretation of the IRRSA can be so unreasonable that it constitutes a failure to comply with the terms of IRRSA. He concluded that that is what occurred in the adjudication of J.W.'s claim.</P>
<P>101. The appellant submits it was within the discretion of the Supervising Judge to interpret the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule thusly. By substituting its own interpretation of the non-binding <EM>Schachter</EM> rule for the interpretation of the Supervising Judge, and thereby overturning the Supervising Judge's decision, the Manitoba Court of Appeal failed to show the deference that should have been accorded to the Supervising Judge.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>The Honour of the Crown</TI>
<P>102. In the SCC Records Decision, this Court dismissed an appeal by Canada of an Ontario Court of Appeal decision that substantially affirmed the Ontario Supervising Judge's decision respecting the IAP records of claimants. In his decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4585</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;ONSC Records Decision&rdquo;), the Ontario Supervising Judge commented on the applicability of the concept of the honour of the Crown. The Ontario Supervising Judge reasoned that the honour of the Crown is relevant to the IRRSA. He held that, while the honour of the Crown principle is &ldquo;not operative as a source of obligations independent of the IRSSA&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;helpful in interpreting the IRRSA.&rdquo;
<P1>ONSC Records Decision at para. 84</P1></P>
<P>103. The Ontario Supervising Judge asserts: &ldquo;The IRSSA is not a treaty between Canada and its Aboriginal peoples, but it is at least as important as a treaty.&rdquo; Therefore, as interpretive principle respecting the IRRSA, the honour of the Crown applies in a manner that is similar to its applicability in the interpretation of treaties between Canada and aboriginal peoples.
<P1>ONSC Records Decision at para. 88</P1></P>
<P>104. The Ontario Supervising Judge summarizes the relevance of the honour of the Crown for the IRRSA as follows:
<QUOTE><P>If an honourable interpretation and a dishonourable interpretation are both available, obviously it would be wrong to interpret the IRSSA in a way that does dishonor to Canada. As an interpretative principle, the honour of the Crown would also apply as an interpretative principle to the other signatories of the IRSSA, who can be taken to have intended an honourable interpretation over a dishonourable one.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>ONSC Records Decision at para. 90</P1></P>
<P>105. The MBCA has held that J.W. may be denied compensation in the IAP based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA's Compensation Rules, and yet has no recourse to the supervising courts. Such an interpretation finds no significance in the language of the IRRSA and the class proceedings statutes which make the IRRSA subject to court approval. In effect, the IRRSA is interpreted in abstraction from the approval orders and class proceedings statutes.</P>
<P>106. The appellant, on the other hand, submits that it is inconsistent with the honour of the Crown to ascribe to the parties to the IRRSA the intention of excluding judicial recourse to claimants who are denied the benefits promised in the IRRSA based upon unreasonable interpretations of its Compensation Rules. An interpretation that provides for judicial review or judicial recourse for J.W. is available to this Court, as an alternative to the MBCA interpretation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>H.</N><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>107. While the language of the IRRSA, the provisions of the <EM>CPA</EM> and the Schulman Approval Order all seem to support active court supervision of the IAP, a rule against judicial review entered the jurisprudence with <EM>Schachter</EM>. The decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal at issue in this appeal restricts access to the supervising courts even further. The appellant submits that the project of defining a mode of &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; that is unique to the IAP and establishing an <EM>ad hoc</EM> standard of &ldquo;recourse&rdquo; that is more restrictive, or deferential than the reasonableness standard was misguided.</P>
<P>108. In the courts below, there were submissions by Canada and the Chief Adjudicator to the effect that court recognition of a right to judicial recourse for residential school survivors who were denied compensation in the IAP based upon unreasonable interpretations of the Compensation Rules would result in disruption. The appellant is unsure what to make of these submissions, as the factual foundation presented for them was tenuous. However, the appellant has submitted that, in some cases, supervising courts purporting to follow <EM>Schachter</EM> have produced decisions that are, in the end, reconcilable with reasonableness review, per <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>. The &ldquo;disruption&rdquo;&mdash;at least in the jurisprudence&mdash;should not be overstated.</P>
<P>109. In both <EM>Schachter</EM> and the MBCA decision,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA at paras. 61, 63, 64 and 71</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> it is reasoned that the IRRSA was intended to be an &ldquo;expeditious&rdquo; process. This is offered as a reason to reject judicial review of IAP decisions.
<P1><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras. 47 and 54</P1></P>
<P>110. However, there is no provision of the IRSSA, or the approval Orders which signifies that the speedy disposition of claims is so important that the supervising courts must refrain from overturning unreasonable interpretations of the Compensation Rules by which compensation claims are denied. The Preamble of the IRRSA does not refer to any expeditious processes. It does, however, provide as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The Parties desire a fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRRSA at Preamble at para. B</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>111. There is no support in the IRRSA or the approval orders for the view that a speedy disposition of claims is more important than the adjudication of the claims in accordance with the Compensation Rules for which the survivors bargained. The adjudication of claims pursuant to the Compensation Rules that the survivors bargained for accords with the Agreement's stated purpose of achieving a fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of the Indian Residential Schools</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>PART IV: SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>112. J.W. is a residential school survivor who was denied compensation in the IAP. Pursuant to the Schulman Implementation Order, he made application to the supervising court in Manitoba and was granted an Order in his favour. He defended against Canada's appeal of the supervising court's decision and is now appealing the MBCA's decision in Canada's favour. He has raised issues of public interest in this Court and in the courts below, upon which the courts below have delivered inconsistent decisions and reasons. The issues he has raised and their resolution affect a group of vulnerable Canadians. Raising the issues in this Court benefits the administration of justice and is in the public interest.</P>
<P>113. Even in the event J.W. loses this appeal, his appeal has raised important issues relating to the implementation of the IRRSA and he has played a helpful role in the analysis of those issues. This Court has discretion respecting costs and has exercised that discretion to award costs in favour of a losing party in the appropriate circumstances.

<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The central issue in this appeal is when a court has jurisdiction to review an adjudicator's decision under the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), the individual compensation scheme created under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA). The Court of Appeal of Manitoba was correct in overturning the decision of the Queen's Bench Supervising Judge, who set aside the IAP re -review adjudicator's decision and substituted his own conclusion on whether an act was a compensable claim under the IAP. The Supervising Judge erred in law by taking jurisdiction in the absence of very exceptional circumstances, where an adjudicator fails to enforce the provisions of the IAP Model. The Supervising Court's disagreement with the result does not equate to a failure to enforce or apply the IAP Model and does not justify judicial intervention. The standard of review of the Supervising Judge's decision to take jurisdiction is correctness.</P>
<P>2. The IRSSA is a historic settlement agreement that is designed to be a fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution to the legacy of Indian Residential Schools (IRS), and promote healing, education, truth, reconciliation and commemoration. The IRSSA makes two streams of individual monetary payment available to former students&mdash;the Common Experience Payment (CEP) and the IAP. This appeal concerns the latter process.</P>
<P>3. The Appellant JW applied for compensation under the SL1 category of the IAP Model. While in the boys' lineup for showers, a nun grabbed JW's penis over his b athing gown. JW pulled away and said &ldquo;don't.&rdquo; The first-instance adjudicator who heard his evidence found that the incident happened as JW described it. However, after considering all of the factual circumstances and the SL1.4 criteria, she was not prepared to conclude, based only on the part of the body touched, that the act was a sexual assault under the IAP model. Two review adjudicators, acting in succession, found that the first -instance adjudicator had applied the IAP Model and had not made a palpable and overriding error in her consideration of the evidence.</P>
<P>4. Multiple superior and appellate level courts have concluded that the parties to the IRSSA intended that IAP decisions would be final, absent very limited, extraordinary circumstances. Such circumstances should be exceedingly rare, as the IRSSA includes multiple checks, balances and mechanisms to resolve any IAP-related disputes that may arise, such as the one under appeal.

<P>5. Notwithstanding the comprehensive mechanisms in the IRSSA, the Appellants invite this Court to expand the test upon which the courts may intervene in final IAP decisions. Such an expansion would undermine the intentions of the parties to the IRSSA and the objectives of the agreement, namely, the efficient, effective and timely resolution of claims through a culturally sensitive inquisitorial adjudicative process with finality and certainty. Further, any expansion could have a chilling effect on future class action settlements.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>29. The Appellants filed a Request for Direction (the RFD) with the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, in its capacity as a Supervising Court, seeking to overturn all three adjudicators' compensation decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended Request for Direction dated May 4, 2016 at paras 2 and 26&ndash;29 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11, pp 2 and 11); <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 MBQB 159</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>JW QB</EM></BOLD>] at paras 1&ndash;3 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 23).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Appellants argued that the interpretation of the SL1.4 category of sexual abuse adopted by the adjudicators in this and other IAP decisions constituted a failure to properly apply the IAP Model and therefore the IRSSA. They further submitted that the Supervising Court had the power to order that the adjudicators apply a different interpretation in order to properly comply with the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 18&ndash;20 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 29&ndash;31).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. In determining whether or not the Supervising Court had jurisdiction to consider the RFD, the Supervising Judge referenced the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Schachter</EM>].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras 50&ndash;58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The threshold set out in <EM>Schachter</EM> is sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;<BOLD><EM>Schachter</EM></BOLD> threshold.&rsquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at para 28 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 34-35).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. The Supervising Judge found that he had the jurisdiction to review the re-review adjudicator's decision to determine whether the re-review adjudicator had properly applied the terms of the IRSSA, and specifically the Compensation Rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at para 35 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 39).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With respect to the Supervising Court's jurisdiction, the Supervising Judge found that:
<P1>a. the Supervising Court's jurisdiction was limited to &ldquo;ensuring that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case;&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at para 40 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 41).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>b. an &ldquo;unreasonable interpretation&rdquo; of the SL1.4 category could amount to a failure to apply the terms of the IRSSA, such that the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold would be met;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 39, 56-58 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 40, 46).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>c. Supervising Courts can disturb the adjudicator's findings of fact where the adjudicator's fact finding process involved a failure to properly apply the terms of the IRSSA and IAP, which was not then corrected on review or re-review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at para 42 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 41).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>32. The Supervising Judge interpreted the SL1.4 category differently than the first -instance adjudicator, concluding that a reasonable and proper interpretation of that category does not require proof of a perpetrator's sexual intent or sexual purpose in order to make out a compensable claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 54 and 57 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 45-46).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He then applied his interpretation of the SL1.4 category to the re-review decision, deciding that: the first-instance adjudicator had failed to properly apply and enforce the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP; either the review adjudicator or the re-review adjudicator should have corrected this error; and by failing to correct the error in the first-instance adjudicator's interpretation, the re-review adjudicator failed to properly apply and enforce the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP to JW's claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 57-58 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 46).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. As a remedy, the Supervising Judge issued a declaration that the re -review adjudicator's decision failed to implement the IRSSA due to the adjudicator's improper interpretation of the SL1.4 category and ordered that JW's claim be remitted to a first-level adjudicator for reconsideration in accordance with his reasons.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 59-60 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 47).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>

<P>35. The MBCA found that the Supervising Judge's jurisdiction to hear and determine JW's RFD was a question of law, reviewable on the correctness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 19&ndash;26 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 60&ndash;62).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. The MBCA held that the parameters of the right to access the courts for directions in relation to adjudicators' final IAP decisions are those set in <EM>Schachter</EM>: &ldquo;...in the very limited circumstances where the final decision of the [re-review adjudicator] reflects a failure to comply with the terms of the [IRSSA] or the implementation orders, the aggrieved party may apply to the Administrative Judges for directions.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 36&ndash;38 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 65&ndash;67), citing <EM>Schachter</EM> at para 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. In deciding what constitutes &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances,&rdquo; the MBCA noted an important distinction between: (a) a failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders; and (b) the correctness or reasonableness of the adjudicators' interpretation or application of those terms.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 40&ndash;42 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 68-69).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The MBCA found that in the latter case, a Supervising Judge's disagreement with a final adjudicator's decision does not mean that there has been a failure to enforce the IRSSA, and does not permit the Supervising Judge to assume the role of the re-review adjudicator and impose his or her own findings of fact, interpretation of the IAP, or application of the facts to the terms of the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 42-43 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 69-70).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The MBCA found that the Supervising Judge erred by re-stating and expanding the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold when he found that Supervising Courts may review IAP adjudicators' final decisions to determine the reasonableness of their interpretation of the terms of the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JWMBCA</EM> at paras 49&ndash;53 and 72 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 71&ndash;73 and 79).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The MBCA found that this expansion of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold amounted to an appeal or judicial review of the Adjudicator's Decision<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 52 and 71 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 73 and 79).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that would result in a significant broadening of claimants' and Canada's ability to access to the Courts for review of IAP decisions beyond the terms of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 54-55 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 73-74).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. The MBCA found that the Supervising Judge also erred by adopting a standard of review that is not found in the IRSSA, the IAP or the jurisprudence, and one that is akin to the now&mdash;rejected standard of patent unreasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 56-58 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 74-75).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This standard was described by the Supervising Judge as a consideration of whether the adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP is &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 56 and 71 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 74 and 79); <EM>JW QB</EM> at para 40 (AR Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 40-41).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. Finally, the MBCA noted that the IAP Model contemplates that adjudicators may have differing interpretations of the IAP because there is no <EM>stare decisis</EM>; and that any difficulties that may arise from adjudicators' conflicting interpretations of the IAP Model should be resolved through the Oversight Committee, not through RFDs to the Courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 65-68 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, pp 77-78).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the result, the MBCA granted the appeal and overturned the Supervising Judge's decision.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;RESPONDENT'S POSITION ON THE QUESTIONS IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>41. The Attorney General of Canada states the issues raised by the Appellants and provides her position on the issues as follows:
<P1>a. What is the standard of review to be applied by the appellate court when reviewing a Supervising Court's decision to take jurisdiction over a final IAP adjudicator's compensation decision? The standard of appellate review on questions of jurisdiction is correctness.</P1>
<P1>b. What is the proper threshold for when a Supervising Court should take jurisdiction over an IAP adjudicator's compensation decision? The proper threshold is the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, which is the very exceptional circumstance where an IAP adjudicator's compensation decision reflects a failure to enforce the provisions of the IRSSA and the implementation order.</P1>
<P1>c. In this case, did the Supervising Court have jurisdiction to review the final IAP adjudicator's compensation decision? The Supervising Judge did not have jurisdiction because the adjudicators enforced the provisions of the IAP Model. The Court of Appeal was correct to allow the Attorney General's appeal and restore the decision of the re -review adjudicator.</P1>
<P1>d. Is judicial review available for IAP adjudicators' compensation decisions? The administrative law concept of judicial review is not available for IAP compensation decisions because IAP adjudicators do not exercise a delegated statutory function and are not carrying out state action.</P1>
<P1>e. Are the appellants entitled to solicitor-client costs either in the event of success on appeal or in any event of the cause? The appellants are entitled to party-party costs under the tariff in any event of the cause.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>STANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW</TI>
<P>42. The applicable standard of review on appeal was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Housen</EM></BOLD>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On questions of fact&mdash;whether adjudicative, social, or legislative&mdash;or of mixed fact and law, the standard of review is palpable and overriding error. However, the palpable and overriding error standard does not apply if a question of law can be extricated from the factual considerations involved. Pure questions of law, and legal issues that can be extricated from questions of mixed fact and law, are subject to review on the correctness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Housen</EM> at paras 8, 10, 36 and 49; <CASEREF><SOC>Sattva Capital Corp. v Creston Moly Corp.</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>50 and 53</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Fontaine Manitoba CA</EM> at paras 38-39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. T he standard of review applicable to contractual interpretation is dependent on the nature of the question. Many cases of contractual interpretation involve the application of mixed fact and law. However, extricable questions of law that invoke the correctness standard exist where, for ex ample, an incorrect principle is applied.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fontaine Manitoba CA</EM> at paras 37-39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. T he Supervising Judge's decision to take jurisdiction to review the IAP re -review adjudicator's decision is an extricable question of law reviewable on the standard of correctness. The Appellants agree that the issues under review are questions of law subject to the correctness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants' Factum dated May 2, 2018 [<BOLD>Appellants' Factum</BOLD>] at para 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supervising Judge's decision is distinguishable from the question addressed by this Court in <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM>. In <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM>, this Court found that appellate review of the Supervising Judge's interpretation of the IRSSA's document disposition provisions is a question of mixed fact and law in which the factual matrix looms large, and is therefore governed by the palpable and overriding error standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> at para 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Although the MBCA did not have the benefit of this Court's analysis in <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> when it released its decision, the Court of Appeal was correct in reviewing all of the issues before it as pure questions of law, subject to the correctness standard of review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 24 and 26 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 62).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. Whether the decision of the Supervising Judge to take jurisdiction is considered on a correctness standard or as one of palpable and overriding error, his decision is in error as being contrary to the IRS SA and the parties' intention that there be only very limited curial review from a decision of a final IAP adjudicator. The jurisdictional question that the Supervising Judge had to consider was whether he had authority to enter into the inquiry asked of him in the Request for Direction. The proper answer is, no. The Supervising Judge should have declined jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 31</CITE><PAGENUM>at 31</PAGENUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> at 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>THE PROPER THRESHOLD FOR WHEN A COURT SHOULD TAKE JURISDICTION OVER AN IAP ADJUDICATOR'S COMPENSATION DECISION</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI><UNDER>The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold: Very Exceptional Circumstances</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. In <EM>Schachter</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that an adjudicator's decision is only reviewable by a Supervising Judge through a Request for Direction and only in &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In particular, a Request for Direction may only be brought where it is alleged that the adjudicator's decision reflects a failure to enforce the provisions of the IRSSA and the implementation orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras 53, 57 and 77-78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. This very limited right of curial review, which was determined in the context of a legal fee review, was applied to an IAP compensation claim by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF> [the <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM>].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Ontario Court of Appeal held that the principles upon which <BOLD><EM>Schachter</EM></BOLD> rests apply with equal force to IAP compensation decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This and other subsequent court decisions in regard to IAP adjudicator compensation decisions confirm the limits imposed by <EM>Schachter</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For example, <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at paras 55-56 and 60; and AW at paras 78&ndash;84.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. Under the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, an adjudicator cannot refuse or fail to consider the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP Model, or choose to consider others, as this would constitute a failure to comply with the IRSSA and the IAP Model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras 53, 57</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The adjudicator is, however, entitled to interpret those terms, which is part of their adjudicative role.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model at pp 7, 31 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, pp 20, 44).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As both the Supervising Judge and the Court of Appeal found, adjudicators are entitled to give context to and interpret the language of the IAP as part of their role in applying the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at para 45 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 70); <EM>JW QB</EM> at para 56 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, p 46).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Disagreement with an adjudicator's conclusion does not equate to a failure to enforce or apply the IAP and does not justify judicial intervention.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold respects the IAP Model, the intentions of the parties to the IRSSA, the importance of the finality of decisions under the IAP, and the relative expertise of adjudicators in deciding IAP claims.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 48; <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IAP adjudication process was intended to be a closed process&mdash;a complete code that limits access to the courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 53; <EM>Schachter</EM> at para 58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is an extensive and detailed process, which provides many benefits for the claimants that are not available in the court process, including: closed hearings at a location of their choice; having their costs paid to attend a hearing; the choice to have a support person attend whose expenses are also paid; and trained counsellors at the hearings.</P>
<P>51. Further, there are litigation benefits for claimants, including having an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial hearing where there is only one examination by a trained and neutral adjudicator. The claimant is not subject to direct and cross-examination by lawyers. The alleged perpetrator is excluded while the claimant testifies. There is a reduced standard of proof for causation in standard track claims.</P>
<P>52. The IRSSA does not provide a right to appeal or apply for judicial review of any decision of an adjudicator or review adjudicator's decision under the IAP. This is in contrast to other provisions of the IRSSA, which specifically provide for access to the courts in specific circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras 50&ndash;52 and 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These are set out at paragraph 28 of the Statement of Facts. These include where an application for CEP is denied in whole or in part.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, Article 5.09(1), (2) at 49-50 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 10, pp 156-57).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If the parties intended that there be recourse to the courts from compensation decisions of IAP adjudicators, they would have provided for such review in the IAP.</P>
<P>53. The parties intended that the implementation of the IRSSA be expeditious and not mired in delay and procedural disputes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There are multiple checks and safeguards in the IAP and IRSSA to ensure that claims are dealt with fairly, sensitively and in a timely manner and that the process is administered fairly and in accordance with the terms of the IRSSA and implementation orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The review and re-review processes discussed above are key components.</P>
<P>54. Further, the Chief Adjudicator's appointment is approved by the Supervising Cou rts and the parties to the IRSSA, and the Chief Adjudicator is accountable to the Oversight Committee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Oversight Committee, comprised of representatives of the parties to the IRSSA, is responsible to &ldquo;monitor the implementation of the IAP and make recommendations to the National Administration Committee (NAC) on changes to the IAP as are necessary to ensure its effectiveness over time&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model at 16 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, 29).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It can propose instructions to adjudicators for review and approval by the NAC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model at 16 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, 29).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The NAC can make recommendations to the Chief Adjudicator for changes to processes or application of the IRSSA. This is the process negotiated by the parties to the IRSSA to address identified needs for changes to the application of the IAP terms.</P>
<P>55. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold has been acknowledged by the parties to the IRSSA, the Supervising Courts and provincial appellate courts as an accurate reflection of the parties' intentions regarding the finality of IAP re-review decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example <EM>JW QB</EM> at paras 25 and 28 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 15, 16-17); <EM>JW MBCA</EM> at para 36 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 65-66); NN at paras 44, 78 and 81&ndash;84; <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at paras 49&ndash;53; <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al v Canada (Attorney General) et al</SOC><CITE>2015 MBQB 158</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM></BOLD>] at paras 164-165.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI><UNDER>The IRSSA parties intended that IAP re-review compensation decisions be final</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. The IAP Model has been described by the multiple supervising and appellate courts as a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo; that limits access to the courts, preserves the finality of the IAP process and respects the expertise of IAP adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 53; NN at para 78; <CASEREF><SOC>Tourville v Fontaine</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 325</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at paras 173 and 178; <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 471</CITE><PARANUM>52 and 73</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The intention of the parties to the IRSSA have been explained by the British Columbia Supreme Court as follows: &ldquo;To put it plainly, when the IAP Model was negotiated, the parties called &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; at re-review by the Chief Adjudicator or his or her delegate.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at para 178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>57. Notwithstanding its reconciliatory significance, the IRSSA is at its root a contract, the meaning of which depends on the objective intentions of the parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> at para 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold respects the intentions of the parties by permitting court intervention only where the adjudicator has failed to consider the terms of the IRSSA. Disagreement with an adjudicator's interpretation of those terms is not enough to warrant the Supervising Courts' intervention. If it were, then all IAP decisions would be reviewable by the Supervising Courts, which is the very thing that the parties intended to avoid and disallowed through the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The intention that IAP re-review decisions be final is borne out by the checks and balances that have been built into the IRSSA, such that the Supervising Courts' intervention should be very rarely required. In particular, IAP claimants, Canada or the Chief Adjudicator may raise concerns regarding inconsistent adjudicator interpretations with the Oversight Committee. Alternatively, the parties may attempt to negotiate a settlement outside the confines of the IAP Model. The IAP Model expressly contemplates both of these possibilities.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model at 16-17 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, pp 29-30).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. The intention that re-review decisions be final is also supported by the fact that where the parties to the IRSSA contemplated that recourse to the courts would be available, they made express provision for that. There is no such provision in regard to IAP adjudicator decisions.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI><UNDER>The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold protects the rights and intentions of all IRSSA parties</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. The proper role of the Supervising Court is not to intervene in individual cases, but to provide guidance to the Chief Adjudicator and the parties to the IRSSA as to the implementation of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 471</CITE><PARANUM>64-65</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This enables the Supervising Court to issue directions where it concludes that the adjudicator has very seriously deviated from what the IRSSA provides. In this case, where the Supervising Judge substituted his own decision on compensability and remitted the matter to a first&mdash;instance adjudicator, the Supervising Court has misunderstood its proper role and stepped outside of its jurisdiction.</P>
<P>61. T he MBCA properly adopted and applied the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold. The strict limits imposed by the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold&mdash;as explained by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM>&mdash;best serve the interests of all parties to the IRSSA. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold preserves the core objectives of the efficient and timely determination of IAP claims through a culturally sensitive inquisitorial adjudicative process that achieves finality. This ensures that the greatest number of class members can access the IAP's compensatory scheme in the shortest possible time, before IAP claimants pass away. Additionally, the IRSSA and IAP contain multiple internal checks and balances to ensure their fair application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>IRSSA</EM>, Article 18.04 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 10, p 189).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>64. The Supervising Judge purported to adopt the <EM>Schachter</EM> test, but then misapplied it and failed to show any deference to the IAP adjudicators. He did not stop at a consideration of whether the re -review adjudicator had failed to consider the terms of the IAP, as he should have done. Nor did he consider the adjudicators' expertise with respect to the interpretation of the IAP and its Compensation Rules. Instead, the Supervising Judge proceeded to step into the role of an IAP re -review adjudicator, substituting his own conclusion on compensability for that of the adjudicator. He concluded that Supervising Courts may intervene where an adjudicator has reached &ldquo;... a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW QB</EM> at para 40 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 4, pp 40-41).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Supervising Judge went on to apply this novel standard, including his own interpretation of the Compensation Rules, to this case. In doing so, he erred in principle by substituting his own compensation conclusion, contrary t o the parties' intention that the IAP Model is a complete code. He had no authority to take jurisdiction.</P>
<P>65. When the IRSSA was approved in 2006, many IRS students were elderly and many were passing away. Over 150,000 Aboriginal children attended Indian Residential Schools, approximately 80,000 of whom were still living in 2008. By the end of 2016, over 38,000 IAP claims were filed and over 26,000 hearings were resolved. This was possible only because the IAP provided an efficient, specialized and final adjudication procedure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 62-63 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 76); see also <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 471</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IAP is now winding down.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 375</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>66. Increased access to the Supervising Courts, as suggested by the Supervising Judge, could undermine the non-compensatory benefits available to IAP claimants. In addition to the non -compensatory benefits outlined in paragraph 50 above, these also include:
<P1>a. only one examination of the claimant by a trained and neutral adjudicator;</P1>
<P1>b. no cross examination of the claimant by adversarial lawyers;</P1>
<P1>c. the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator from the hearing during the claimant's testimony; and</P1>
<P1>d. a reduced standard of proof for causation in standard track claims.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at para 47 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 70-71).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>67. The importance of very limited recourse to the courts is underscored by the statements of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>Doing justice, however, involves more than going straight to what the judge thinks is the right result. Justice requires that procedural rules and jurisdictional boundaries designed to respect the rights of all parties be respected.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at para 63; cited with approval by Hunter JA in <EM>NN</EM> at para 276 (dissenting in result).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>68. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia expressed a similar sentiment in <CASEREF><SOC>Myers v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>All sympathies favour the appellants. The residential schools system is one of the darkest chapters of our history and its pernicious effects continue to be felt even to this day. However, in my respectful view, much as our sympathies might encourage us to be expansive in our interpretation of the IRSSA to permit the appellants to benefit from the IAP, we must not do so. Baron Rolfe once memorably wrote....:
<QUOTE><P>This is one of those unfortunate cases in which ... it is, no doubt, a hardship upon the plaintiff to be without a remedy, but by that consideration we ought not to be influenced. Hard cases, it has been frequently observed, are apt to introduce bad law.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>This too is one of those unfortunate cases. In my opinion, granting the order sought by the appellants would introduce bad law.

<BLOCK3><N>iv.</N><TI><UNDER>The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold should not be expanded</UNDER></TI>
<P>69. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold should not be expanded. An expansion that would permit the Supervising Court's sustained and frequent intervention in re-review decisions by IAP Adjudicators will not honour the parties' intentions. Moreover, it may have unintended negative consequences to class members. As noted by the MBCA in the decision below, increasing access to the courts causes significant delay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at paras 62-63 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 76).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This could affect all claimants' ability to efficiently and finally access IAP benefits by adding a litigation process on top of the IAP's adjudication model.</P>
<P>70. The addition of a litigation process following IAP re-review decisions could also have negative financial and emotional consequences to claimants. The IAP Model is intended to reduce the harm to claimants and ensure that counselling is readily available. The IRSSA does not make these benefits available in the Supervising Courts RFD process, as the parties did not intend for there to be further litigation. Additional litigation steps would also increase legal expenses for all parties.</P>
<P>71. To date, the IRSSA is the largest and most complex class action settlement in Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It serves as an aspirational precedent for other class litigants. An expansion of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold may have a chilling effect on the potential for future class action settlements like the IRSSA. A decision that overrides the parties' intentions to bring claims to an end through a creative, tailor made adjudicative process, or that otherwise expands access to the courts when class proceedings have been settled, may well affect the willingness of future class action litigants to enter into such creative and beneficial settlement agreements.</P>
<P>72. From a policy perspective, it is preferable to allow the IAP to operate as the parties intended, with its internal review mechanisms and multiple checks and balances. This will respect the parties' intentions, preserve the objectives of the IRSSA and ensure that the greatest number of class members can access a culturally sensitive, supportive, inquisitorial adjudicative process that results in an efficient final IAP compensation decision in the least amount of time.</P>
<P>73. The MBCA rightly determined that an expansion of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, as proposed by the Supervising Judge, would result in access to the courts being available for many IAP decisions, rather than limited or exceptional IAP decisions, which is contrary to the intentions of the parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>JW MBCA</EM> at para 54 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 6, p 73).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This decision should be upheld on appeal.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI><UNDER>The proper application of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold in this case</UNDER></TI>
<P>74. The Supervising Courts' role is to ensure that adjudicators apply the IAP Model. It is a role of restraint. The Supervising Court must not step into the role of the adjudicator and reassess the facts, re&mdash;evaluate the merits of the case, or substitute the Court's preferred compensation conclusion for that of the adjudicator who has applied the proper terms of the IAP Model.</P>
<P>75. In this case, the Supervising Judge overstepped his proper role and exceeded his jurisdiction. When he determined that the first-instance adjudicator had applied the IAP Model to reach a conclusion on compensability, his inquiry should have stopped. He did not have jurisdiction under the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold to proceed any further.</P>
<P>76. The SL1.4 category specifies that the claimant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was touched by an adult employee or other adult lawfully on the school premises in a manner which exceeds recognized parental contact and violates the sexual integrity of the student.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>IAP Model</EM> at p 3 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, p 16).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>77. The first-instance adjudicator considered all of the facts and circumstances of the incident involving JW and the nun, concluding that: the nun grabbed JW's penis over clothing in the presence of other boys in line for showers; the act was personally embarrassing for JW; JW did not see the nun's face or expression; the act was very quick as JW pulled away and pushed her hand away and said &ldquo;don't;&rdquo; and JW never saw the nun touch other boys.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Adjudicator's Decision</EM> at paras 14&ndash;17, 20, 22 and 25 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 1, pp 3&ndash;5).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The adjudicator had regard to and applied the IAP Model to these facts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Adjudicator's Decision</EM> at paras 22&ndash;26 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 1, pp 4-5).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> She was not prepared to conclude, only based on the party of the body touched, that the act was a sexual assault within the requirements of the IAP model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Adjudicator's Decision</EM> at para 25 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 1, pp 4-5).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The first-instance adjudicator's decision was reviewed by two other adjudicators, in succession, to determine whether the IAP Model had been properly applied and whether a palpable and overriding error had been made.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model at p 14 (AR, Vol 2, Tab 11A, p 27); <EM>Review Decision</EM> at paras 9&ndash;12 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 2, pp 8, 9); <EM>Re-Review Decision</EM> at p 4 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 3, p 16).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They both concluded that the first-instance adjudicator's decision was reasoned, and explained that she had applied the IAP Model to the facts and her decision was not outside the range of a reasonable outcome because not every touching of a boy's penis automatically constitutes sexual abuse.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Review Decision</EM> at para 21 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 2, p 11); <EM>Re-Review Decision</EM> at p 6 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 3, p 18).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. Each of the three adjudicators carefully considered the appropriate terms of the IAP and explained the reasoning behind their decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Adjudicator's Decision</EM> at paras 22&ndash;27 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 1, pp 4-5); <EM>Review Decision</EM> at paras 5&ndash;7 and 9&ndash;21 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 2, pp 7&ndash;11); <EM>Re-Review Decision</EM> at pp 4&ndash;6 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 3, pp 16&ndash;18).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While an adjudicator's complete disregard for the terms of the IAP could amount to the very exceptional circumstances that warrant judicial intervention pursuant to the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, that did not occur in this case.</P>
<P>80. The first-instance adjudicator performed the task that she was assigned to do: that is, to apply the IAP Model to the facts as proven by the Claimant. Adjudicators are trained and experienced in the IAP Model and in making decisions in compensation claims. Their decisions are entitled to significant deference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at paras 51 and 53; <EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at paras 17&ndash;20 and 180-181.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>81. In their factum, the Assembly of First Nations accept the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold as the governing test for recourse to the courts from an IAP adjudicator's decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AFN factum at paras 76&ndash;80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Specifically, the AFN accepts that the parameters in <EM>Schachter</EM> allow the court to intervene only in &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; and &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; circumstances where there has been a failure to comply with the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AFN factum at paras 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> They go on to then conflate applying the terms of the IRSSA and IAP Model with interpretation of the agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AFN factum at paras 80&ndash;87.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is an important difference between the two.</P>
<P>82. An adjudicator who applies the terms of the IAP, which is what the adjudicator in this case did, is performing the task assigned to adjudicators. A disagreement with the adjudicator's interpretation or application of the IAP Model does not come within the very limited circumstances that allow for recourse to the Supervising Courts.</P>
<P>83. The adjudicator in this case had regard to and applied the factors in the SL1.4 category in reaching her decision, which was upheld by two review adjudicators as within the range of a reasonable outcome. The adjudicator carefully considered the facts and applied them against the SL1. 4 factors. In light of all the circumstances, she was not prepared to conclude, only based on the part of the body touched, that the act was a sexual assault.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Adjudicator's Decision</EM>, paras 24&ndash;27 (AR, Vol 1, Tab 1, pp 4-5).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The adjudicator clearly applied the terms of the IAP Model and did so in a reasoned manner. Disagreement with the outcome does not lead to a basis for saying the adjudicator did not apply the IAP model. Recourse to the Supervising Courts is not available in this circumstance.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>JUDICIAL REVIEW IS RESERVED FOR THE REVIEW OF STATE ACTIONS</TI>
<P>84. The administrative law concept of judicial review is not available for IAP decisions because adjudicators do not exercise a delegated statutory function and are not carrying out state action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 51; <EM>Spanish IRS (Appeal)</EM> at paras 49&ndash;51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, IAP adjudicators exercise a function conferred on them by the parties to the IRSSA, as approved by the Supervising Courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>85. As stated by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Highwood Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v Wall</SOC></CASEREF> [<EM>Highwood</EM>], the purpose of judicial review is to ensure the legality of state decision making. It is a public law concept that allows, <EM>inter alia</EM>, s. 96 courts to supervise lower tribunals to ensure that they respect the rule of law. Judicial review is only available where there is an exercise of state authority and where that exercise is of a sufficiently public nature.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Highwood Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v Wall</SOC><CITE>2018 SCC 26</CITE><PARANUM>13-14</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. While decided in a different context, the principles stated in <EM>Highwood</EM> apply with equal force here to refute the Appellants' arguments that judicial review is available from IAP decisions and that the principles of administrative law apply.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants' Factum at paras 46&ndash;53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> IAP adjudicators do not exercise state authority. The Supervising Courts' administrative and supervisory jurisdiction over the implementation of the IRSSA<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> at para 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> does not elevate IAP adjudicators to actors of the state. The IRSSA was negotiated and agreed to by the parties after lengthy and complex negotiations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Semple</EM> at para 32; <CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><YEAR>2006</YEAR><CITE>83 OR (3d) 481</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM> at para 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It was not imposed on the parties by the legislative or executive branches of government, through legislation or otherwise.

<P>87. The principles of administrative law do not apply in these circumstances and accordingly, judicial review does not lie.

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>88. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold fulfills the intentions of the parties to the IRSSA. The IAP Model is intended to be a complete and final code for the adjudication of IAP compensation claims, with built in checks and balances&mdash;including the adjudicator review process and the Oversight Committee&mdash;to ensure its fair and consistent application. The parties to the IRSSA intended that adjudicators' re -review compensation decisions would be final, absent very exceptional circumstances. Only in such limited exceptional circumstances, where a final re-review decision fails to consider the terms of the IRSSA, can it be said that the parties intended for there to be a limited curial review.</P>
<P>89. An expansion of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold would not honour the parties' intentions or the objectives of the IRSSA. An expansion would result in the addition of litigation following a final IAP adjudication decision, in which the IAP's harm reduction measures will be unavailable. It will add to the parties' financial and emotional costs with no real benefit. It is not the agreement for which the parties bargained.</P>
<P>90. Affirming the existing <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold respects the parties' intentions and ensures th at the greatest number of class members can access final IAP compensation decisions&mdash;with all of the accompanying benefits of that system&mdash;in the least amount of time. This is of critical importance given that many claimants are elderly and in poor health. In those rare circumstances where the IAP Model creates a perceived unfairness, the parties are free to negotiate individual settlements or to raise the issue with the Oversight Committee. Neither of these options will impede the important IRSSA objectives of finality and efficiency. On balance, the interests of the parties to the IRSSA are best served by maintaining the existing <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold. This case does not meet the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;SUBMISSIONS AS TO COSTS</TI>
<P>91. The Attorney General of Canada does not seek her costs of this appeal.</P>
<P>92. The Attorney General of Canada says that party-party costs should be awarded to the Appellants in any event of the cause, in this Court and the courts below. However, the Attorney General of Canada opposes the Appellants' request for costs on a solicitor and own client basis.</P>
<P>93. An award of solicitor and own client costs, or full indemnity costs, is an extraordinary remedy that should only be utilized in the most exceptional circumstances. To merit an award of full indemnity costs, it is not enough that a claim bear on matters of public importance. As this Court stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>, in the context of a constitutional challenge brought by individuals and a public interest litigant, &ldquo;[a]lmost all constitutional litigation concerns &lsquo;matters of public importance,&rsquo;&rdquo; yet only the most exceptional of constitutional challenges will merit such an award. In addition, the issues at stake must transcend the individual interests of the successful party and be shown to have a widespread and significant societal impact.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 5</CITE><PARANUM>137 and 140</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>94. To the extent that the Appellants rely on their personal interest in bringing this appeal as the basis for an award of solicitor and own client costs, they have not established reason to deviate from the normal rule as to party-party costs. In so far as they rely on having raised important matters relating to the implementation of the IRSSA, the issues in this appeal do not rise to the level of a truly exceptional nature so as to merit an award of full indemnity costs. In <EM>Fontaine SCC</EM>, dealing with whether the IRSSA allowed for destruction of records generated by the IAP, the successful litigant (Independent Counsel) was awarded costs on a party-party basis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. This appeal pertains to the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRSSA&rdquo;) and, more specifically, the IAP that was created pursuant to the IRSSA to compensate residential school survivors who were victims of abuse, including sexual abuse.</P>
<P>2. The IAP supports healing and reconciliation among former students of Indian Residential Schools, their families and communities, which stresses the importance of establishing clear and unambiguous guidelines for the implementation of the IRSSA. The AFN Respectfully submits that the Manitoba Court of Appeal's interpretation of SL1 claims under the IAP is erroneous and the decision of the Manitoba Court of the Queen's Bench is the correct interpretation.</P>
<P>3. The Courts below have greatly narrowed the scope of judicial supervision and severely limited recourse available to residential school survivors who have proved abuse, but nonetheless been denied compensation in the IAP. Under no circumstances should it be easier to secure a conviction in a criminal court, than for a claimant to obtain an award in the IAP. As one of the effects of participating in the IAP is to release Canada and Churches from liability for abuse suffered, barring access to any form of oversight may deprive Residential School Survivors of the compensation to which they are rightfully entitled.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>Statement of Facts</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i)</N><TI>IRSSA</TI>
<P>4. The AFN is a signatory to the IRSSA. The IRSSA is a negotiated settlement of numerous class actions brought against the Government of Canada and various church entities for damages suffered by former students of Indian Residential Schools. The IRSSA was executed by all Parties on May 8, 2006.</P>
<P>5. The IRSSA seeks to remedy harms and abuses suffered by former residential school students through delivering a fair resolution, which will promote &ldquo;healing, education, truth and reconciliation and commemoration&rdquo;. Compensation under the IRSSA includes two different elements to address the legacy of Indian Residential Schools:
<ITEM><P>a Common Experience Payment (CEP) for all eligible former students of Indian Residential Schools; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>an Independent Assessment Process (LAP) for claims of sexual or serious physical abuse.</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii)</N><TI>The IAP</TI>
<P>6. The IAP is established by the IRSSA through Article 6 and Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;. The IAP provides a customized adjudicative process for the resolution of claims of serious physical abuse, sexual abuse or other wrongful acts suffered while attending an Indian Residential School covered under the IRSSA.</P>
<P>7. The IAP is a modified litigation process which is altered in order to meet the adjudicative criteria for testing the evidence, while also considering claimants' welfare. The process is an inquisitorial system which serves the dual purpose of assessing claimants' credibility and the harms suffered by them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE><PARANUM>29-30</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. The IAP is a court ordered process created for the sole purpose of resolving former students' continuing claims for serious abuse, in which Canada is a defendant. The IRSSA has been characterized as a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo;, including the IAP compensation rules. The compensation rules provide an award for the stipulated compensable acts, consequential harms, a ggravating factors, future care, loss of opportunity, and actual income loss. No party may amend the IAP compensation rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 1671</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The IAP Model is composed of a hearing and begins with a claim submission by the claimant. The claimant can either accept the decision of the adjudicator or request a review. Compensation is determined through the use of a point system composed of categories. The sum of this assessment will determine the monetary value that ranges from $5000&ndash;275,000 in compensation. For SL1.4 claims, the award range is from $5,000&ndash;$10,000.</P>
<P>10. The IAP model established by the Parties to the IRSSA, is significantly different from the adjudicative models utilized by other tribunals in Canada. Parties have different procedural rights that may not apply elsewhere. The role of adjudicators is inquisitorial, not investigative. The IAP prescribes procedures that adjudicators are required to follow without deviation. Some specific directions given to adjudicators found in Appendix IX include the following:
<QUOTE><P>Compensation for proven continuing claims is to be determined exclusively pursuant to the Compensation Rules. The Rules are designed to ensure that compensation is assessed on an individualized basis. While the abuse suffered is an important indicator of the appropriate level of compensation, so too are the circumstances in which the abuse was suffered by the individual, and the particular impacts it had on him or her.</P>
<P>The Compensation Rules were expressly designed to avoid a mechanistic approach to compensation by recognizing that a relatively less serious act can have severe consequences, and vice versa. They accomplish this goal by requiring both an objective assessment of the severity of the abusive act, and then a distinct and highly subjective assessment of how that act affected the individual Claimant. Accordingly, the categories defining acts and harms must be assessed separately, and the words in each category must be read purposively within their respective contexts.</P>
<P>In particular, in determining the level of harm suffered by a Claimant, adjudicators are to consider each of the five categories as a whole, and in relation to the other categories, rather than focusing on isolated words within a given category. This IAP calls for a contextual consideration, having particular regard to the headings for each category, in order to determine which of the categories best reflects the Claimant's proven level of harms resulting from compensable abuse.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement</EM> (2006), Sch. D, App. IX.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>11. Adjudicators are required to adhere to the IAP model. Adjudicators do not have any authority, nor are they permitted to deviate from the rules regarding the categories of proven acts. Once a proven act has been determined according to the rules stipulated under Schedule D, the adjudicator may then exercise some discretion to choose the point level with in that range.</P>
<P>12. In <CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Winkler required the administration of the IAP to be under the direction of the Court, not Canada. The Court held that &ldquo;the administrative function must be completely isolated from the litigation function with an autonomous supervisor or supervisory board reporting ultimately to the courts.&rdquo; This was accomplished by the Implementation Orders ensuring that the Chief Adjudicator would be confirmed by, report to, and take direction from the Courts, and not from Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada</SOC><CITE>83 O.R. (3d) 481</CITE><PARANUM>37-38</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii)</N><TI>The IAP Compensation Model</TI>
<P>13. Schedule D of the IRSSA sets out the categories of abuse covered under the IAP. The categories of abuse are apportioned according to the severity of the abuse in a scale that begins with SL1 for less severe acts of abuse ending with SL5 for severe acts of sexual abuse.</P>
<P>14. There are four types of abuse within the SL1 category. The last of these four subcategories (SL1.4) and the subject of this appeal is as follows:

<P>15. In assessing allegations of abuse, an adjudicator is first required to make a determination that the acts of abuse have been proven on the civil standard of proof. Once the act is proven, the adjudicator has discretion to choose the point level within the pre -set range stipulated by Schedule D. The second requirement of an adjudicator is an assessment of the proven consequential harms which flowed from an act of abuse. This is also set out in a scale whereby the lowest level H1 covers a modest detrimental impact and the highest level H5 covers continued harm resulting in serious dysfunction. Only a plausible link between the proven act and harm is required for an order of compensation.</P>
<P>16. Once the act(s) of abuse and consequential harms have been established an adjudicator must then determine whether any of the listed aggravating factors have been proven. The IAP takes into account that the presence of aggravating factors can make acts of abuse worse and, thus, a claimant may be entitled to further compensation. Only those aggravating factors listed in Schedule D may be taken into account by an adjudicator.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supra</EM> at note 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The final steps in the IAP process are an assessment of a loss of opportunity, actual income loss, future care and a final assessment of compensation.</P>
<P>17. J.W.'s IAP claim arose from an incident while he was in the shower room of an IRS. According to J.W., a nun called J.W. over and he complied with her request. The nun attempted to touch his penis then grabbed his penis over the apron once. J.W became angry and pushed her hand away. The nun became angry and grabbed him by the left ear, then shook him by the ear and tried to bang his head against the wall, but didn't.</P>

In coming to this conclusion, the adjudicator held that there must be a sexual purpose associated with such conduct and the claimant must prove the motive of the perpetrator.

<P>24. J.W. sought judicial recourse through the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench. The Supervising Judge found the courts have the power to review the decision of the Re-Review adjudicator to determine whether she failed to apply the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP Compensation Rules. He acknowledged that this type of review is reserved for exceptional cases.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Supervising Judge, at para 35</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. The Supervising Judge found that IAP adjudicators involved in J.W.'s claim failed to properly apply the IRSSA's terms and this non-compliance has resulted in the denial of legitimate claims for compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Supervising Judge, at para 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court held:
<QUOTE><P>In my view, the interpretation of SL1.4 adopted by the Adjudicator and approved by the Review Adjudicator and Re-Review Adjudicator is fundamentally inconsistent with the plain language of SL1.4 and with the criminal law jurisprudence regarding sexual assault that the Adjudicator purported to apply. It is simply not reasonable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Supervising Judge, at para 44.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. The Supervising Judge found that where adjudicators replaced the words &ldquo;any touching&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;sexual touching&rdquo;, such re-wording leads to a legally absurd result.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Supervising Judge, at para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The court noted the test applied by the Adjudicators erroneously implies that there could be &ldquo;sexual touching&rdquo; by an adult of a child that is within the boundaries of recognized parental contact. The Court found this proposition to be unsupportable as no parent can sexually touch his or her own child.</P>
<P>27. The Supervising Judge disagreed with Adjudicators importing a requirement into SL1.4 claims that sexual abuse must be done for a &ldquo;sexual purpose.&rdquo; The Supervising Judge held that for SL1.4 claims, the sexual intent or sexual purpose of the perpetrator is not relevant or determinative.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Supervising Judge, at paras 47, 51, 52 &amp; 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court noted that a child's sexual integrity can be violated without a perpetrator having any sexual intent whatsoever.</P>
<P>28. The Court sent back J.W.'s claim to be re-adjudicated, noting that &ldquo;where an interpretation exceeds the bounds of reasonableness, and when that unreasonable decision results directly in a claimant being denied compensation to which he would otherwise be entitled, the IAP adjudicators have failed in their task and claimants are denied the benefits promised by the IRSSA. The IAP has not been followed and enforced.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>4.</N><TI>Decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba</TI>
<P>29. In reasons written by Justice Beard, the Court of Appeal overturned the Order of the Supervising Judge. The Manitoba Court of Appeal held that the Supervising Judge erred in his interpretation of his jurisdiction to hear and determine the Request for Direction. The Court of Appeal determined that jurisdiction was limited to determining whether the ad judicator implemented the provisions of the IAP in the narrow sense of considering the correct terms. Once it was determined that the adjudicator considered the correct terms, his jurisdiction ended and should have dismissed the Request for Direction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Attorney General of Canada v JW and Reo Law Corporation et al</SOC><CITE>2017 MBCA 54</CITE><PARANUM>72</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. The Court of Appeal held that the Supervising Judge substituted a higher standard of review of &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case&rdquo;, which results in carrying out an appeal or judicial review of the adjudication and review decision. The Court of Appeal is of the view that IAP compensation decisions are not subject to either an appeal or judicial review by the courts on any standard.</P>
<P>31. In determining the review process, the Court of Appeal noted that broadening the review process went beyond the extremely limited recourse to the courts that was permitted in <BOLD><EM>Schachter</EM></BOLD>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schechter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE></CASEREF>, [<EM>Schechter</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court of Appeal found that this would significantly increase the time required to complete an individual and overall claims process, which fails to respect the objectives of providing a closed and expeditious adjudication process.</P>
<P>32. The Court of Appeal emphasized that over 26,000 IAP claims have been held over the last ten years. The Court of Appeal appears to be preoccupied with the proposition that if J.W.'s appeal is successful, all past IAP claims would be open to review by the courts. The Court noted that Judges may disagree with an adjudicator's unreasonable interpretation of the IAP, however, such unreasonable interpretations are not subject to review.</P>
<P>33. This concern does not logically follow from the facts of this case. The applicant's appeal rests on SL1.4 exclusively and does not bring the entire IAP process into question. If this appeal is allowed, only a very small fraction of past IAP cases&mdash;those pertaining to minor sexual assaults as defined by SL1.4&mdash;would be open to review by the courts. Indeed, clarification of SL1.4 by the Supreme Court would serve to bolster the finality of the IAP process by ending erroneous interpretations of SL1.4 and thereby ensuring that victims of minor sexual assaults receive the compensation for which they bargained when the IRSSA was drafted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>34. The AFN submits that this appeal raises the following issues:
<P1>a. Whether the Manitoba Court of Appeal erred in finding that the lower Court did not have jurisdiction to review an IAP decision, which denied J.W.'s claim?</P1>
<P1>b. Whether the Manitoba Court of Appeal erred in determining that the original adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP model did not amount to modifying the IRSSA?</P1>
<P1>c. Whether there is any general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review or judicial recourse in cases pertaining to administrative tribunals which are formed pursuant to the terms of a class action settlement?</P1>
<P1>d. Whether the Manitoba Court of Appeal erred in finding that claimants whose IAP claims are denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRSSA have no recourse to the courts supervising the implementation, enforcement and administration of the IRSSA?</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Jurisdiction to Review IAP Decisions</TI>
<P>35. This Honourable Court held that the interpretation of IRSSA is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable for palpable and overriding error:
<QUOTE><P>The interpretation of the IRSSA is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable for palpable and overriding error. Contractual interpretation generally involves questions of mixed fact and law subject to appellate deference (<CASEREF><SOC>Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 53</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2014] 2 S.C.R. 633</CITE><PARANUM>50-51 and 55</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Heritage Capital Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 19</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2016] 1 S.C.R. 306</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>). This rule is not absolute. It does not apply, for example, to the interpretation of a standard form contract, where its interpretation has precedential value, and there is no meaningful factual matrix specific to the particular parties to assist the interpretation process (<CASEREF><SOC>Ledcor Construction Ltd. v. Northbridge Indemnity Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 37</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2016] 2 S.C.R. 23</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>). In our view, however, the general rule stated in <EM>Sattva</EM> applies here, such that the palpable and overriding error standard governs appellate review of the supervising judge's interpretation of the IRSSA. While the IRSSA undoubtedly has &ldquo;very significant implications for Canada and our aboriginal peoples&rdquo; (C.A. reasons, at para. 294), it is at root a contract, the meaning of which depends on the objective intentions of the parties. As the majority at the Court of Appeal observed, the question of impact is distinct from precedential value. While the supervising judge's interpretation of the IRSSA will impact thousands of IAP claimants, it will have no significant precedential value outside of the IAP due to the IRSSA's <EM>sui generis</EM> nature. And, as shall become apparent below, the factual matrix looms large in ascertaining the meaning of this particular contract.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine</SOC><CITE>[2017] 2 SCR 2015</CITE><PARANUM>31-32</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Jurisdiction to Review IAP Decisions</TI>
<P>36. The AFN submits that the Supervising Judge had the authority and jurisdiction to hear J.W. Request for Direction. The court's inherent jurisdiction, the applicable class proceedings law, and the approval and implementation order provide the court with the powers to make orders and impose such terms as necessary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 1955</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. In addition, the court has an ongoing obligation to oversee the implementation of the IRSSA and to ensure that the interests of the class members are protected, in particular any vulnerable class claimants. In <BOLD>Baxter v. Canada (Attorney General),</BOLD> Justice Winkler stated:
<QUOTE><P>The court has an obligation under the <EM>Class Proceedings Act</EM> (&ldquo;CPA&rdquo;) to protect the interests of the absent class members, both in determining whether the settlement meets the test for approval and in ensuring that the administration and implementation of the settlement are done in a manner that delivers the promised benefits to the class members. In seeking the approval of the court, the plaintiffs and defendants essentially seek the benefits of having the court sanction the settlement. Such approval cannot be divorced from the obligation it entails. Once the court is engaged, it cannot abdicate its responsibilities under the CPA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Baxter</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 4 at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. The supervisory jurisdiction of the Court is to be exercised to ensure that claimants obtain the intended benefits of the IRSSA. The court's supervisory jurisdiction over class action settlements includes the jurisdiction to remedy problems with the settlement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bodnar v Cash Store Inc.</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 667</CITE><PARANUM>117&ndash;121</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The court's administrative jurisdiction over a class action settlement is independent of any conferral of jurisdiction by the settlement agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fantl v Transamerica Life Canada</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 377</CITE><PARANUM>39</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. However, the court does not have the jurisdiction to impose burdens on the defendant that the defendant did not agree to assume.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lavier v. MyTravel Canada Holidays Inc.</SOC><CITE>2011 ONSC 3149</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. Although IAP adjudicators, as well as other administrative tribunals, are to operate with a high degree of independence and deference is owed to their decision makers, any adjudicator must operate within the terms of either an enabling statute or contractual provisions, which in this case is the IRSSA.</P>
<P>41. An adjudicator is free to interpret written directives, in this case, the IAP model does not extend any leeway to modifying the IRSSA and thereby changing its meaning. Any modifying of the IRSSA by adjudicators is prohibited and requires the unanimous consent of the Parties to the IRSSA.</P>
<P>42. The Supervising Judge aptly pointed out, the adjudicator's interpretation of SL1.4 was seriously flawed. He wrote: &ldquo;<EM>the question is whether or not the incident was</EM> <BOLD><EM>sexual</EM></BOLD> <EM>touching which exceeded recognized parental contact and violated the sexual integrity of the student</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Adjudicator's Reasons, para 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. The AFN submits that the adjective &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; is not actually found in the text of SL1.4 of Schedule D. Nevertheless, the adjudicator went on to state that although the penis is a very sexual part of the body, she was denying J.W. compensation on the basis that he had not show n that the assailant had a &ldquo;sexual intent&rdquo; when she inappropriately touched him.</P>
<P>44. The Supervising Judge further noted, the adjudicator's re -wording of the statute is legally absurd, as it implies that an adult can sexually touch a child and that in some circumstances, this would be within the bounds of recognized parental conduct.</P>
<P>45. Moreover, the adjudicator misapplied a criminal test found in the <EM>Chase</EM> case, in which this Honourable Court interpreted the words &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; in the Criminal Code context.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chase</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At issue was whether a subjective intention on the part of an assailant to commit a sexual assault was required in order to prove the offense. This Honourable Court concluded in <EM>Chase</EM> that, while the perpetrator's subjective intention was a factor to be considered, it was not a requirement that this intention be present for the offense t o occur, nor was it a determinative factor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chase</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 10 at p. 302 para (f).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. The adjudicator's decision could not have been reached without the addition of the adjective &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; to the text of SL1.4, and that her discretionary decision making power did not extend to re-writing the IRSSA. The AFN submits that the act of adding &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; to SL 1.4 amounts to the rewriting of the IRSSA which is not permitted and the court's intervention in this matter was warranted.</P>
<P>47. Recently, the IRSSA Western Supervising Judge held that adjudicators are no t permitted to apply legal standards in other areas of the law into the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018, BCSC 63</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Western Supervising Judge noted that the Chief Adjudicator's importing of administrative law's &ldquo;procedural fairness&rdquo; discourse into the IAP amounted to the rewriting of the IRSSA and was not permissible. The Court stated &ldquo;it is wrong to import administrative law concepts into the IAP in a manner that results in conferring rights and imposing liability for which the parties did not contract&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ibid at paras 5 and 103.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. The IAP Compensation Rules contain an enumerated list of acts that is compensatory where proven to a civil standard. With respect to the SL1.4 category, the &ldquo;act&rdquo; is described by the words &ldquo;any touching&rdquo; and &ldquo;any touching with an object&rdquo;.</P>
<P>49. These words are clear and unambiguous. Any touching, including any touching with an object, is covered by the provision, subject to the qualifications cited later in the same paragraph.</P>
<P>50. It is alleged that adjudicators have interpreted and applied these words in a restrictive manner. Adjudicators have narrowed the act of &ldquo;any touching&rdquo; to only include touching that is sexual in nature. For instance, one adjudicator held that touching &ldquo;captures sexual touching that falls short of stroking or caressing&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended RFD, Re-Review of Decision B-11431, at para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Another adjudicator found that for strapping to be compensable, the strapping must be administered with a sexual or carnal intent.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended RFD, Second Review Decision F-13310, at para 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Finally, one adjudicator stated that &ldquo;not every touching of a boy's penis automatically constitutes sexual abuse.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of Reviewing Adjudicator W-15603, at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>51. The examples noted above suggest adjudicators have misinterpreted &ldquo;touching&rdquo; as outlined in the Schedule D. The &ldquo;act&rdquo; described in this category refers to any touching, not only sexual touching.</P>
<P>52. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines &ldquo;touch&rdquo; as &ldquo;to put your hand, fingers, etc on someone or something; to be in contact with something; and to change or move something&rdquo;. This is the plain meaning of the act contemplated by SL1.4.</P>
<P>53. Touching of a sexual nature alluded to by adjudicators is already included in SL1.1 where incidents of fondling or kissing are compensable. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines &ldquo;fondling&rdquo; as &ldquo;to touch or handle (something) in a gentle way; to touch (someone) in a sexual way&rdquo;. The AFN further submits that there would be no utility in describing the same act twice, therefore, SL1.4 &ldquo;touching&rdquo; is to be read as different from SL1.1 &ldquo;fondling&rdquo;.</P>
<P>54. Once the act of touching has been established, the second aspect of SL1.4 requires one to determine whether or not the act of touching &ldquo;exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo;.</P>
<P>55. An act of touching that falls within acceptable norms of parent would not fall under SL1.4 abuse. These acts may include the washing of a young child, mild discipline of a young child, dressing a child or administering medical attention. So long as the contact with a child or youth is parental in nature, done for a parental motive and/or can be objectively perceived by a reasonable person to consistent with an acceptable way for a parent to touch a child, such touching would not be covered under SL1.4.</P>
<P>56. The phrase &ldquo;exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo; establishes the compensable act through an objective test. The act of touching becomes &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; in nature when the recognized physical contact is excessive and outside the norms of parental figure, by the standards of the time in which the action took place.</P>
<P>57. The AFN submits that adjudicators have been narrowing the scope of the aspect of SL1.4 by reading in a requirement that the &ldquo;exceeding&rdquo; be tied to contact of a sexual nature. For instance, one adjudicator determined that a claimant had not been subjected to abuse since they had not established the perpetrator had a sexual purpose for having touched the Claimant's genitals.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision of the Adjudicator W-15603, at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Another adjudicator held the touching of sexual parts of a student's body during the course of personal care of children, absent a sexual motive, does not fit within the IAP model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended RFD, Review Decision of B-11431, at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The AFN respectfully disagrees with the above noted interpretation of &ldquo;exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo;, as those views have misapplied the phase. By confining touching to &ldquo;sexual touching&rdquo;, a number of acts such as excessive discipline would no longer be covered by SL1.4. Furthermore, limiting the phrase to sexual touching would render the application of this section redundant, as an objective person would view any sexual touching of a child or youth to exceed recognized parental contact.</P>
<P>59. The proper application of &ldquo;exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo; would include any touching or action that falls outside acceptable standards of parental contact. This would include sexual touching, excessive discipline, hazing rituals, threatening conduct, etc. If the touching included in SL1.4 was to be sexual in nature, the drafters would have inserted this reference into the text of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>60. The Manitoba Court of Appeal's concern for reopening cases that were impacted by a wrong application of the IAP is not a valid reason to deny justice or compensation to victims of sexual abuse. The Manitoba Court of Appeal held:
<QUOTE><P>There is another reason why this difference is important. The court's jurisdiction was described in Schachter as applying in &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; and &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; circumstances (at paras 53, 57). If the jurisdiction includes the right to determine whether there had been an unreasonable interpretation of a term of the IRSSA or IAP, the court's jurisdiction would be extended to many, rather than limited or exceptional, cases. As Sharpe JA said in the Perell appeal, the SJ's disagreement with the adjudicator's conclusion does not equate to a failure to enforce or apply the IAP and justify judicial intervention. If it did, all IAP decisions would be appealable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> <EM>supra</EM> note 19 at paras 52-53, 55, <EM>supra</EM> at note 18 at para 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Modification of the IRRSA</TI>
<P>61. The Court of Appeal found that the question of whether or not the Supervising Judge had jurisdiction to review the conclusions of the IAP in J.W.'s case was a question of law and thus, reviewable on a standard of correctness. Moreover, the Court found that the <EM>Schachter</EM> case established that the right to seek judicial recourse is limited to very exceptional circumstances. One of these circumstances is a failure on the part of the adjudicator to consider the terms of the IRSSA and its implementation orders.</P>
<P>62. The Court of Appeal stated that there is an important distinction between the failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders on one hand, and the correctness/reasonableness of the interpretation of those terms, on the other. The Court of Appeal's decision stands for the proposition that while the Courts may disagree with an adjudicator's unreasonable interpretation and/or decision, any untenable interpretation of the IAP model by an adjudicator will nonetheless comply with the IRSSA and will not equate to a failure to apply the IAP model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 MBQB 159</CITE><PARANUM>54</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>supra</EM> at note 18 at paras 42-43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. The Supervising Judge did not overturn the review adjudicator's decision on the basis of disagreement; he found that the adjudicator had endorsed an interpretation of the IRSSA that was so untenable that it amounted to failure to apply the terms of the IRSSA. In doing so, she overstepped her authority as an administrative decision-maker and reached a conclusion that cannot be reconciled with section SL1.4 of Schedule D of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>64. The Supervising Judge overturned the adjudicator's decision on the basis that it failed to consider the terms of the IRSSA by adding an adjective to SL1.4 that altered its meaning. Any resemblance to the former standard of patent unreasonableness is purely incidental and did not constitute grounds to overturn the Supervising Judge's decision.</P>
<P>65. The Court of Appeal failed to consider whether the adjudicator's improper re-wording of SL1.4 amounted to a failure to apply the terms of the IRSSA. Thus, the Supervising Judge's conclusions were not overturned on the basis of any legal principle, but rather the Appeal's Judge rather tenuous finding that the Supervising Judge had reviewed the adjudicator's decision based on a standard of reasonableness.</P>
<P>66. The AFN submits the Supervising Judge could perhaps have been more precise in the terminology he employed, the crux of his reasoning was based on the adjudicator's modifying SL1.4 and thereby reaching a decision that did not respect the terms of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>67. With respect to the IRSSA, the Court's oversight of the implementation of the settlement is multifaceted. In <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Brown stated:
<QUOTE><P>The oversight of the implementation of a settlement with an adjudicative compensatory process invokes different objectives. The court supervision aims to ensure that legitimate claims are compensated to the full extent available under the settlement terms and that the process by which those claims are adjudicated has the integrity, impartiality and transparency expected of any other court process. Further, where the adjudicative process has non-compensatory benefits, the supervisory objective is to ensure that those benefits are not compromised or sacrificed to expedite the compensatory elements.</P>
<P>The IAP provides both compensatory and non-compensatory benefits. Pursuant to the settlement terms, claimants are entitled to compensation for proven claims of abuse. They are also entitled to the opportunity to have their claims adjudicated in a non-confrontational process that takes into account special considerations in determining credibility, which in essence, is the main issue in respect of any claim in the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supra</EM>, note 1 at para 29-30; 130-131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>68. Canada correctly pointed out in the appeal that according to the terms of the IAP, there is no stare decisis; adjudication decisions are not binding on other adjudicators. Each is free to arrive at his or her own interpretation; thus, it is anticipated within the IAP that there may be differing interpretations. While this is certainly true, the absence of precedential value and openness to interpretation does not permit an adjudicator to rewrite key provisions of the IAP model. This is a clear violation of the confines of the role of an administrative decision maker.</P>
<P>69. The Court does have the jurisdiction to supervise the interpretation and implementation of the IRSSA; however, it does not have the power to amend the agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 283</CITE><PARANUM>176</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>No Availability of Judicial Review</TI>
<P>70. There is no general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review in cases pertaining to administrative tribunals which are formed pursuant to the terms of a class action settlement. Indeed, supervising judges must ensure that the terms of any agreement reached as a result of a class action settlement are respected and that claimants receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Even in the absence of express provisions for judicial oversight, an administrative tribunal can never operate with total independence from the Superior Courts.</P>
<P>71. Superior Courts possess inherent jurisdiction. All administrative tribunals and/or adjudicative processes are the creations of either a statute or a contractual agreement and, therefore, do not possess the inherent jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. The IAP was established through the IRSSA. Although the right to judicial review can be restricted, it can never be completely excluded. This principle was succinctly enunciated in the <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> case:
<QUOTE><P>By virtue of the Constitution, superior courts are the only courts that possess inherent jurisdiction. They are responsible both for applying the laws enacted by Parliament and the legislatures and for insuring that statutory bodies respect their legal boundaries. Parliament and the legislatures cannot totally exclude judicial oversight without overstepping the division between legislative or executive powers and judicial powers. Superior courts are, in the end, the protectors of the integrity of the rule of law and the justice system. Judicial review of administrative action is rooted in these fundamental principles and its boundaries are largely informed by the roles of the respective branches of government.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 190</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>72. As noted recently by this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine</SOC></CASEREF>, within the context of the IRSSA, Supervising Judges have broad powers conferred upon them by the orders which approved and implemented the IRSSA.
<QUOTE><P>As we have already noted, nine provincial and territorial superior courts certified the class action and approved the IRSSA (see, e.g., <EM>Baxter</EM>). Judges of these courts were designated as supervising judges, and play a vital role under the IRSSA. Supervising judges, significantly, have <EM>administrative and supervisory jurisdiction</EM> over the implementation and administration of the IRSSA and can, among other things, hear requests for directions. If, therefore, the proper administration and implementation of the IRSSA necessitates direction on the handling of the IAP Documents, supervising judges are empowered to give that direction.</P>
<P>These broad powers are conferred upon supervising judges by the orders which approved and implemented the IRSSA (see, e.g., supervising judge's reasons, at paras. 157&ndash;59). They are also supported by class action legislation, which provides that courts must have generous discretion to make orders and impose terms as necessary to ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of class actions (see, e. g., <EM>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</EM>, S.O. 1992, c. 6, s. 12; <CASEREF><SOC>Endean v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 42</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2016] 2 S.C.R. 162</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Fontaine</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 20 at para 31-32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. The IRSSA approval Orders state &ldquo;this Court shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment&rdquo;. This language requires the superior courts to supervise the implementation of the IRRSA, including the IAP, for compliance.</P>
<P>74. The doctrine of the separation of powers requires that administrative tribunals and adjudicative processes like the IAP, which was created through the IRSSA, remain under the supervision of superior courts, which retain final judicial authority.</P>
<P>75. Of particular importance is the fourth factor set out in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> to determine whether intervention in an administrative tribunal's decision is warranted: the object of the statute. In this case, the object of the IRSSA is to provide compensation to victims of abuse in residential schools. In merging the numerous lawsuits filed against the government of Canada and various churches, the IRSSA sought to simplify a massive undertaking and ensure that victims of residential school abuse obtained the compensation to which they were entitled. Failure to provide this compensation is contrary to one of the objects of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Dunsmuir</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 40 at para 160.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>Judicial Recourse</TI>
<P>76. It is well established that IAP Claimants have access to judicial recourse. Recourse is available for claimants whose IAP claims are denied based on unreasonable interpretations of the IRSSA to the courts supervising its implementation, enforcement and administration. Jurisprudence is clear that court intervention is warranted if the interpretation of a statute is unreasonable and does not engage with the appropriate elements of statutory interpretation.</P>
<P>77. In <EM>Schechter</EM>, the Court of Appeal of Ontario emphasized the importance of respecting the expertise of the Chief Adjudicator. The Court left open the possibility of judicial recourse in very exceptional circumstances:
<QUOTE><P>[I]n the very limited circumstances where the final decision of the Chief Adjudicator reflects a failure to comply with the terms of the [IRSSA] or the implementation orders, the aggrieved party may apply to the Administrative Judges for directions. <UNDER>These limited circumstances would include where the Chief Adjudicator upholds a decision of the Adjudicator as fair and reasonable even though the Adjudicator failed to consider the factors set out in para. 18 of the implementation orders in arriving at his/her fee review decision in a specific case.</UNDER> By providing for recourse to an Administrative Judge in these limited circumstances, the parties will be able to ensure that the bargain to which they consented is respected.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schechter</EM> <EM>supra</EM> note 19 at paras 57, also at 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>78. The <EM>Schechter</EM> threshold on judicial recourse was endorsed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Spanish</EM>.
<QUOTE><P><EM>Schachter</EM> imposed strict limits on the scope for judicial intervention. It did so to respect the IRSSA, the contract the parties negotiated, of which the IAP is a fundamental part. As this court recognized in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 241</CITE><PARANUM>48</PARANUM></CASEREF>: &ldquo;[a]djudicators are specially trained to conduct the hearing in a way that is respectful to the claimant and conducive to obtaining a full description of his or her experience&rdquo;. The IAP has been aptly described as &ldquo;a complete code&rdquo; that limits access to the courts, preserves the finality of the IAP process and respects the expertise of IAP adjudicators: see <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE><PARANUM>178</PARANUM></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v.

<P>79. The British Columbia Court of Appeal recently held that consideration of an exceptional circumstance must include a reflection of the stated objectives of the IRSSA to achieve a &ldquo;fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools&rdquo; that seeks to promote &ldquo;healing, education, truth and reconciliation and commemoration&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>N.N. v.

The Court of Appeal failed to engage with the facts of the case that constitute a failure of the IRSSA and IAP Model.</P>
<P>81. The method of interpretation for the IRSSA has been determined in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>The principles of interpretation applicable to the Settlement Agreement are straightforward. The text of the agreement must be read as a whole. The plain meaning of the words used will be important as will the context provided by the circumstances existing at the time the Settlement Agreement was created. A consideration of both is necessary to reach a proper conclusion about the meaning of the contested provisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al v The Attorney General of Canada et al</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 684</CITE><PARANUM>68</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>82. The interpretation of the IRSSA is to follow a contractual approach that advances the intent of all the parties. The words in the agreement should be given their ordinary and literal meaning and not be read in isolation, but in harmony with the agreement as a whole. This holistic interpretation of the IRSSA is expressed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 283</CITE><PARANUM>62&ndash;67</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>83. Justice Perell further clarified that the Courts may be required to look at the factual background and the purpose of the agreement, when interpreting the contract.
<QUOTE><P>In searching for the intent of the parties at the time when they negotiated their contract, the court should give particular consideration to the terms used by the parties, the context in which they are used and the purpose sought by the parties in using those terms: <CASEREF><SOC>Frenette v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 64</CITE></CASEREF>. Provisions should not be read in isolation but in harmony with the agreement as a whole: <CASEREF><SOC>McClelland and Stewart Ltd. v.

<P>Generally, words should be given their ordinary and literal meaning: <CASEREF><SOC>Indian Molybdenum Ltd. v. The King</SOC><CITE>[1951] 3 D.L.R. 497</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>. However, if there are alternatives, the court should reject an interpretation or a literal meaning that would make the provision or the agreement ineffective, superfluous, absurd, unjust, commercially unreasonable, or destructive of the commercial objective of the agreement: <CASEREF><SOC>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v.

<P>84. Moreover, the scope of &ldquo;reasonable outcomes&rdquo; must be taken into consideration. As suggested in both <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v Canadian Human Rights Commission</SOC></CASEREF> [<EM>Canadian Human Rights Commission</EM>] and <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v Jagjit Singh Farwaha</SOC></CASEREF>, Stratas J.A. suggested that the extent of the &ldquo;range&rdquo; will depend primarily on the nature of the question, with a broader range for questions of fact and policy, a narrower one for legal questions. Stratas J.A. in <EM>Canadian Human Rights Commission</EM> states that interpretation of must fall inside a &ldquo;range&rdquo; of reasonable outcomes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v Jagjit Singh Farwaha</SOC><CITE>2014 FCA 56</CITE><PARANUM>94&ndash;96</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IRSSA interpretation of the SL1.4 compensation rule would be narrower. Further, the implementation of the test for sexual assault from the <EM>Chase</EM> case warrants the court's intervention into this matter.</P>
<P>85. On simple plain-language analysis of SL1.4, clearly a child's sexual integrity can be violated without a perpetrator having any sexual intent. This Honourable Court noted that the failure of applying the proper legal test will mark the decision with unreasonableness in <CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 1</CITE><PARANUM>201</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. Further, statutory interpretation does not warrant deference if the provision is clear, as stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</SOC></CASEREF>. Evans J.A. suggested: &ldquo;if a reviewing court concludes that one interpretation is &lsquo;right&rsquo;, after conducting a textual, contextual, and purposive interpretative analysis of the legislation, and giving careful and respectful consideration to the tribunal's reasons...the court may intervene to ensure administrative compliance with the legislature's clearly expressed intention&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration,)</SOC><CITE>2013 FCA 263</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The clear interpretation of SL1.4 was not considered with the errors of the adjudicator inserting words and implementing legal tests improperly.</P>
<P>87. This is followed in the Supreme Court decision <CASEREF><SOC>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>. Moldaver J. states, &ldquo;Where the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation lead to a single reasonable interpretation and the administrative decision maker adopts a different interpretation, its interpretation will necessarily be unreasonable&mdash;no degree of deference can justify its acceptance&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 SCR 895</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>88. The AFN respectfully submits that the application of criminal law standards in SL1.4 acts results in the misapplication of the Compensation Rules. This misapplication is further compounded by the fact that there is an inconsistent application of the <EM>Chase</EM> test. For instance, some adjudicators apply relevance to the intent of perpetrator in the commission of an act, while others place no consideration on intent at all. The inconsistent application of <EM>Chase</EM>, at times, leads to very different result for SL1.4 claimants.</P>
<P>89. The adjudicators in J.W.'s claim have applied the <EM>Chase</EM> test in interpreting aspects of sexual assault that are enumerated in Schedule D. The AFN submits the adjudicator's improper application of the <EM>Chase</EM> test resulted in a substantive departure of the IAP model, as all three adjudicator's determined the perpetrator's sexual intent is required to establish that abuse took place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision B-15571, at p. 103.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>90. With regard to the relevance of sexual intention or motivation, <EM>Chase</EM> states:
<QUOTE><P>It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Chase</EM> <EM>supra</EM> at note 10, at para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>91. The <EM>Chase</EM> test considers whether the assault committed was committed in the circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim was violated. <EM>Chase</EM> states that this is to be determined within an objective test, one of a reasonable person looking at the entirety of the circumstances.</P>
<P>92. When making a determination on sexual abuse, the <EM>Chase</EM> case outlines factors that should be looked at in the totality of the circumstances, such as: the part of the body that was touched, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures that accompany the act, other circumstances surrounding the conduct (such as threats) and the intent of the accused. It has been expressed within the <EM>Chase</EM> decision that the intent of the accused is not a determinative factor alone, but one that should be considered.</P>
<P>93. The adjudicators in J.W.'s claim misunderstood and misapplied the <EM>Chase</EM> test relating to sexual intention being a requirement to establish sexual abuse.</P>
<P>94. The application of the <EM>Chase</EM> test is not appropriate in the context of SL1.4 claims. As noted above, the Compensation Rules and the Schedule D contain the complete code in which an adjudicator is to assess evidence, apply standards and award compensation.</P>
<P>95. The motive or intent of the perpetrator is not relevant in relation to assessing claims under SL1.4. The standard in which the impact of a compensable act is to be assessed is through a subjective lens, which takes into account the views of the Residential School Survivor.</P>
<P>96. It is beyond IAP adjudicator's authority to unilaterally make &ldquo;sexual intent&rdquo; of perpetrators a &ldquo;technical element&rdquo; of SL.1.4 claims. That proposition is inconsistent with the IRSSA, the IAP model and contrary to the instructions provided by the signatories of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>97. Under no circumstances should it be easier to secure a conviction in a criminal court, than for a claimant to obtain an award in the IAP. Under these circumstances, the Supervising Judge properly exercised his jurisdiction in upholding the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP.</P>
<P>98. The implementation of an inappropriate legal test from the <EM>Chase</EM> decision along with improper insertion of words that fundamentally change the meaning of the compensation rule SL1.4 is not only unreasonable, but falls outside a range of acceptable outcomes. Court intervention is necessary in this matter to ensure administrative compliance and to inform not only claimants, but adjudicators of the substance of the IRSSA and IAP model.</P>
<P>99. Furthermore, the erroneous application of the Chase case amount to a condition whereby it is far easier to obtain a conviction in the criminal courts for an act of touching a child's genitals that it would be to obtain a modest award in the IAP.</P>
<P>100. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. V. (K.B.)</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. V. (K.B.)</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>8 O.R.

<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>101. The fundamental issue at stake in this case is whether or not IAP Claimants have judicial recourse where the IAP model is not applied properly or where adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP model in untenable, The Courts below have essentially closed the door to any judicial recourse for IAP claimants. This Honourable Courts direction will have precedential value for IAP Claimants and add clarity to other IAP proceedings.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I: OVERVIEW OF POSITION AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (the &ldquo;IRSSA&rdquo;) is the largest and most complex class action settlement in Canada. It has two compensatory components, a Common Experience Payment (&ldquo;CEP&rdquo;) and the Independent Assessment Process (&ldquo;IAP&rdquo;). This appeal concerns the IAP, a <EM>sui generis</EM> claims adjudication process, negotiated by the parties to the IRSSA as the appropriate means of providing compensation to individuals for the harms they suffered from experiencing sexual and physical abuse and other wrongful acts when they attended an Indian Residential School (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;). The parties recognized that resolving tens of thousands of these deeply painful and personal individual claims on a respectful and timely basis required a tailor-made approach. As a result, the IRSSA sets out their detailed agreement about the criteria for compensation, the criteria and process for selecting claim adjudicators, the procedures for resolving claims, the rights of review, the process for oversight and the strictly private and confidential nature of the IAP. The parties agreed to two levels of internal review of compensation decisions, and established a mechanism by which the parties can provide direction on the interpretation and application of the IAP. They made no provision for court review of IAP decisions. This is in contrast to CE P determinations, which are, by the terms of the IRSSA, appealable to the court.</P>
<P>2. The question in this appeal is when a supervisory court can interfere with the determinations made by IAP adjudicators on the interpretation or application of the specialized IAP compensation rules in the course of deciding individual claims. The first supervising judge to consider this question, who was also the judge who issued the leading decision approving the IRSSA, held that there was no recourse to the courts in respect of IAP decisions. Two other supervising judges, including the judge who decided the case under appeal at first instance, later found that the courts could exercise a &ldquo;general curial review jurisdiction&rdquo; over IAP decisions. But the western administrative judge and each of the three appellate courts that have considered this issue, including the Court below in the case on appeal, have held that there is no right of appeal from or judicial review of IAP decisions, and that it is not open to courts to take upon themselves the roles that the IRSSA assigns to IAP adjudicators. Only in two &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; circumstances can a court provide relief with respect to specific IAP claims. First, in the &ldquo;perhaps unlikely event&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Schachter CA</EM>], at para. 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that an adjudicator makes a decision without regard to the IAP compensation or review criteria, the courts can send the decision back to ensure that IAP adjudicators carry out the functions assigned them. Second, courts can provide remedies that are supplemental to those within the scope of IAP adjudicators' authority to provide. In both of these cases, the court's supervisory jurisdiction is exercised in a manner that is respectful and supportive of the parties' decision to provide adjudicators with exclusive authority to decide individual claims. This constrained jurisdiction does not permit courts to review the interpretive or factual findings of IAP adjudicators or conduct the review functions assigned to IAP review and re-review adjudicators.</P>
<P>3. The appellants ask this Court to disagree with the consensus of the Courts of Appeal of Manitoba, Ontario and British Columbia, and find instead that IAP decisions are reviewable by way of judicial review on the standard of reasonableness. In the alternative, they ask this Court to find that a supervising judge can review IAP decisions for reasonableness under the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; test. This would mean that IAP decisions would ultimately be subject to five levels of review after the initial determination&mdash;first in the IAP and then in the courts. And it would ultimately be courts utilizing court processes, not IAP adjudicators utilizing IAP procedures, that would be responsible for the interpretation and application of the IAP compensation rules. There is no principled reason why such judicial recourse would only be open to claimants and not Canada. This raises the prospect of placing burdens on IAP claimants that the parties to the IRSSA clearly never intended: battling Canada through multiple levels of court to confirm their right to IAP compensation, contending with obtaining and paying for legal representation and rules on costs in the courts, and defending against the presumptive application of the open court principle to their identities and the details of their claims.</P>
<P>4. The Chief Adjudicator says that the appellate decisions on this issue respect the &ldquo;distinctive nature of the IAP and the expertise of IAP adjudicators&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 26</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Spanish CA</EM>], at para. 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and preserve the finality the parties sought to achieve in the IAP. In the IRSSA, the parties agreed that it would be IAP adjudicators, selected by the parties and trained in the IAP, and not courts, who would interpret and apply the IAP terms.</P>
<P>5. Furthermore, the IAP is now almost complete. If courts start reviewing the holdings of individual adjudicators, previously upheld throughout the IAP review process, the certainty and finality provided by the custom-designed IAP will be significantly compromised. This would undermine the parties' efforts to obtain expeditious resolution of thousands of individual claims within a safe, confidential and non-adversarial process.</P>
<P>6. As a respondent on this appeal, the Chief Adjudicator will address the IRSSA provisions relating to the IAP and the respective jurisdictions of adjudicators and courts in relation to the IAP. Respectful of considerations of finality and impartiality in adjudicative decision-making, the Chief Adjudicator will take no position on the merits of the IAP adjudicators' decisions that are the subject of this appeal, and will not seek to supplement the reasons given by those adjudicators.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The IRSSA</TI>
<P>7. The IRSSA settled numerous class actions brought against the Government of Canada and various religious organizations for the harms suffered by Indigenous children at residential schools. Its purpose, set out in the agreement itself, is to achieve a &ldquo;fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, preamble at art. B, Appellants' Record (&ldquo;A.R.&rdquo;), Tab 10, p. 108.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IRSSA was negotiated by counsel in the class actions, Canada, the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Representatives and the various religious organizations. It was signed by the parties on May 8, 2006.</P>
<P>8. In December 2006, the courts in nine provinces and territories concurrently issued reasons certifying a single national class action relating to the residential schools and approving the proposed settlement with certain modifications. In March 2007, Approval and Implementation Orders were entered in each of the nine supervising courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Approval Order, A.R., Tab 8, p. 85; Implementation Order, A.R., Tab 9, p. 98. Identical Approval and Implementation Orders for the other provinces can be found online at: <UNDER>http://www.classactionservices.ca/irs/library.htm</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The Approval Orders specifically incorporate the terms of the IRSSA. They also provide that the courts will supervise the implementation of the agreement and &ldquo;may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this Judgment.&rdquo; The Implementation Orders incorporate a Court Administration Protocol (the Request for Direction or &ldquo;RFD&rdquo; process) by which applications may be brought to the supervising courts for directions in respect of the implementation, administration or amendment of the agreement and the judgments.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Implementation Order, Schedule A: &ldquo;Court Administration Protocol&rdquo;, A.R., Tab 9, p. 105.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>Compensation under the IRSSA</TI>
<P>10. The IRSSA establishes two compensation schemes: the CEP (art. 5) and the IAP (art. 6 and Sch. D). The CEP provides $10,000 to eligible claimants for the first whole or partial year of residence at an IRS, and $3,000 for each additional whole or partial year. Article 5.09 provides for appeals of determinations made on CEP applications. The first level of appeal is to the National Administration Committee (&ldquo;NAC&rdquo;) (art. 5.09(1)). The NAC is made up of five representatives from plaintiffs' groups, one from the government and one from the churches. If the NAC denies the appeal in whole or in part, the applicant may appeal to the court (art. 5.09(2)). The western administrative judge has determined almost 750 CEP appeals.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 375</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>2018 Bundled RFD</EM>], at para. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. The parties did not provide for an appeal to the courts from IAP decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>There is a unique mechanism for limited access to the courts for certain claims (Sch. D, art. III(b), p. 8). This mechanism is available for three specific issues, requires leave of the Chief Adjudicator, and does not involve court review of IAP adjudicators' decisions. See <CASEREF><SOC>Kelly v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 MBCA 93</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Kelly</EM>]. There is also an mechanism for the NAC to access the courts to request additional resources for IAP claim processing (IRSSA, art. 4.11(12)(q)).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IAP was designed to provide additional compensation for specific proven sexual or physical abuse, or other wrongful acts, suffered by IRS students. It is a claimant-centred adjudicative process, developed to address the particular circumstances of individual claimants, and to provide timely, effective, private and confidential resolution of claims involving deeply painful experiences suffered by claimants as children many years ago. Like all aspects of the IRSSA, the IAP was the product of careful negotiations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Bundled RFD</EM>], at paras 3, 10, 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. The IAP is now nearly complete. As of May 31, 2018, 99.95% of all anticipated IAP hearings have been held: 26,649 in total.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statistics are updated regularly and found on <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/stats-eng.php</UNDER>. For statistics as of August 31, 2017, see <EM>2018 Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Of the 38,098 total claims filed, 37,766 (99%) have been resolved. Of the 332 unresolved claims, only 10 hearings were scheduled for a later date, 4 hearings remain to be scheduled, 110 claims are expected to be resolved through other means, and 208 claims are awaiting decisions. Over $3.1 billion has been paid to successful claimants. Almost 90% of claims admitted to the IAP that have gone to hearing or negotiated settlement have resulted in an award in favour of the claimant.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>The IAP is a <EM>sui generis</EM> compensation system</TI>
<P>13. Schedule D sets out the parties' agreement regarding what claims are compensable in the IAP, the procedure for adjudicating claims, the selection and training of adjudicators who decide claims, and the review procedures.</P>
<P>14. IAP adjudicators are bound by the provisions of Sch. D regarding what constitutes a compensable claim, and how compensation is to be calculated. The categories of compensable claims (referred to as &ldquo;continuing claims&rdquo;) are set out, as are compensation grids for compensable acts, consequential harms, aggravating factors, opportunity loss, future care, and actual in come loss that can be the subject of an adjudicator's award (Sch. D, arts. I and II, pp. 2&ndash;6).</P>
<P>15. Actual income loss and other wrongful act claims are determined in the complex issues track (Sch. D, art. III(b)(ii), p. 8). All other claims proceed in the standard track.</P>
<P>16. Appendix IX provides further direction that, <EM>inter alia</EM>, compensation may only be assessed by the compensation rules:
<QUOTE><P>The criteria for a continuing claim flow from, but may differ from, established case law on vicarious liability and negligence. Adjudicators are not to have reference to case law on vicarious liability and negligence. The compensability of proven continuing claims must be determined only by reference to the terms of this IAP, including instructions issued pursuant to it. (Sch. D, App. IX, p. 31)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>17. Only the actual income loss component of actual income loss claims, which are a very small number of claims, are calculated using the legal analysis and amounts awarded in court decisions (Sch. D, art. II, p. 6). All other awards, and other components of actual income loss claims, are based on the application of the unique compensation rules in the IAP. In several cases, the parties adjusted the substantive law to provide a more expeditious and respectful process. For example, the IAP eschews vicarious liability analysis, and instead the defendants accept liability for all &ldquo;adult employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;adults lawfully on the premises&rdquo; (Sch. D, art. I, p. 2, and App. IX, p. 31). Consequential harm is proven using a relaxed &lsquo;plausible link&rsquo; standard rather than the conventional causation analysis (Sch. D, art. III(b)(v), p. 8, and App. IX, p. 35).</P>
<P>18. The IAP process revolves around the claimant's hearing, which is a private and confidential one-day proceeding, held at a location of the claimant's choosing,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Subject to hearings being scheduled to promote economy (Sch. D, art. III(j)(i), p. 13).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> with the claimant's support persons and health support person present. Evidence and credibility are tested through questioning by the adjudicator in a hearing process designed to minimize further harm to claimants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE><PARANUM>29-30</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Because of the need for a safe and efficient hearing process, parties have different procedural rights than they would enjoy in a court of law. Alleged perpetrators have the right to respond to the claimant's allegations and to testify but not to receive the claimant's personal information or to confront or cross-examine the claimant directly (Sch. D, art. III(g), p. 12). Alleged perpetrators face no liability under the IAP. All compensation awards are paid by Canada.</P>
<P>20. The inquisitorial model selected by the parties for the IAP is significantly different than the adjudicative model utilized by courts and most other tribunals in Canada. The adjudicator manages the hearing, questions all witnesses (except expert witnesses), and then makes the necessary findings of fact to determine whether, and how much, compensation should be awarded. Adjudicators are empowered to make binding findings of credibility, liability and compensation (Sch. D, art. III(a)(v), p. 7).</P>
<P>21. Some of the specific directions given to adjudicators include:
<QUOTE><P>The adjudicator's questioning must both draw out the full story from witnesses (leading questions are permitted where required to do this), and test the evidence that is given (questioning in the form of cross examination is permitted where required to do this) (Sch. D, art. III(e)(ii), p. 9).</P>
<P>The Claimant and the alleged perpetrator may give their evidence in their own words in narrative form and are subject to questioning by the adjudicator. Refusal to answer questions may result in finding that answers would have been detrimental to the witness's position (Sch. D, art. III(e)(v), p. 10).</P>
<P>The role is inquisitorial, not investigative. This means that while the adjudicator must bring out and test the evidence of witnesses, only the parties may call witnesses or produce evidence, other than expert evidence (Sch. D, art. III(e)(iv), p. 10).</P>
<P>Where counsel attend hearings, they may meet with the adjudicator at intervals to suggest questions or lines of inquiry. The adjudicator must explore the proposed lines of inquiry unless he or she rules them to be irrelevant to credibility, liability or compensation in the IAP, but the adjudicator retains discretion on the wording of the questions put to a witness (Sch. D, art. III(e)(ix), p. 10).</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iv.</N><TI>IAP adjudicators are specially selected and trained</TI>
<P>22. A unique combination of skills is required to apply these unique rules and inquisitorial procedures.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Recognizing this, the parties agreed that adjudicators should be highly-qualified individuals (Sch. D, App. V, p. 24) and selected by all-party consensus (Sch. D. App. XIII, p. 48). They receive intensive training approved by the IAP Oversight Committee and ongoing mentoring by the Chief Adjudicator and other senior adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For the Chief Adjudicator's responsibility for training adjudicators, see Sch. D, art. III(s)(i), p. 17; for the Chief Adjudicator's responsibility to promote consistency, see Sch. D, arts. III(m)(ii) and (s)(i), pp. 14, 17; for the role of training materials in supporting the hearing process, see Sch. D, App. X, pp. 39-40.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The parties to the IRSSA negotiated and agreed to the selection criteria for IAP adjudicators. Schedule D, App. V, sets out the skills and capacities that the parties decided were essential for those who would be interpreting and applying the IAP to individual claims. Some of these would be expected of any decision maker in an adjudicative process considering personal injury claims, such as knowledge of personal injury law and damages assessment, and a demonstrated ability to assess credibility and reliability. Other criteria are more specialized for the IAP process, such as sensitivity to Aboriginal culture and history, knowledge of and sensitivity to sexual and physical abuse issues, and the ability to elicit useful evidence in a concise manner. As the western administrative judge has stated, it is &ldquo;noteworthy that adjudicators need not be legally trained, so long as they have a combination of related training or significant experience.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. The parties also agreed to retain control over the appointment of adjudicators. IAP adjudicators are chosen not by the government or by the Chief Adjudicator but by the unanimous agreement of a selection board composed of one representative of each of former students, plaintiffs' counsel, church entities and government, appointed by the IAP Oversight Committee (Sch. D, art. III(r), p. 16, and App. XIII, p. 48).</P>
<P>25. The Chief Adjudicator is responsible for overseeing the administration of, and decision making in, the IAP. He is selected by the IAP Oversight Committee and approved by an Order of the Court. The Chief Adjudicator possesses &ldquo;broad discretion&rdquo; and &ldquo;relative expertise.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter CA</EM>, at paras. 54 and 78; <EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 19; <CASEREF><SOC>N.N. v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 105</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>N.N.</EM>], at para. 81.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He is monitored and guided by the IAP Oversight Committee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. The Chief Adjudicator is responsible for implementing training programs and administrative measures designed to ensure consistency among the decisions of adjudicators in the interpretation and application of the IAP (Sch. D, arts. III(m)(ii) and (s)(i)). He may also assign adjudicators to claims on the basis of their particular expertise (Sch. D, art. III(n)). Adjudicators may consult each other about hearing and decision-making processes, and discuss issues arising in individual cases, so long as they remain solely responsible for deciding the claims they have heard (Sch. D, art. III(m)(i)). Through conferencing, they may come to a common interpretation of certain procedural issues, but each case must be determined on its own merits and IAP adjudicators are explicitly not bound by the principle of <EM>stare decisis</EM> (Sch. D, App. X).</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>v.</N><TI>The IAP review provisions</TI>
<P>27. Schedule D, art. III(a)(v), p. 7, states that:
<QUOTE><P>Adjudicators are, subject to rights of review, empowered to make binding findings on credibility, liability and compensation within the standards set for the IAP.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. The rights of review are set out in art. III(1), p. 14. These provide for a first level review by another adjudicator (the &ldquo;review adjudicator&rdquo;) and a second level review (&ldquo;re-review&rdquo;) by the Chief Adjudicator or his designate (the &ldquo;re-review adjudicator&rdquo;). The parties who can seek a review and the grounds for each level of review are specified.</P>
<P>29. The parties negotiated somewhat asymmetrical review provisions. In the standard track, which handles the vast majority of claims, only claimants may request a review for palpable and overriding error. Defendants may only request such a review for cases in the complex track.</P>
<P>30. In addition, any party may ask the Chief Adjudicator or his designate to determine whether an adjudicator's decision, in the standard or complex track, properly applied the IAP Model. They may also ask for a second level review (&ldquo;re-review&rdquo;) on this ground. If there has been a failure to properly apply the IAP Model, the decision may be corrected. Adjudicators for this type of review are designated by the IAP Oversight Committee on the recommendation of the Chief Adjudicator (Sch. D, art. III(r), p. 16).</P>
<P>31. Nothing in Schedule D, or any other part of the IRSSA, contemplates court review of decisions made by IAP adjudicators, in contrast to other parts of the IRSSA which specifically provide for access to the courts, or other class actions which provide a right of appeal to the courts from the claims process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See the following provisions of the IRSSA which explicitly contemplate court involvement or oversight: arts. 4.11(6), 4.11(9), 4.11(12)(j) and 7.01(2), 4.11(12)(k) and 5.09(2) and 5.09(3), 4.11(12)(1) and 12.01(5), 4.11(12)(q) and 6.03(3), 4.11(13), 4(11)(14), 4.12(7), 5.04(3), 13.08(2), 13.08(4). The lone IAP provision for access to the courts (Sch. D, App. III, (b), p. 8) is precise and narrow and does not involve court review of adjudicators' decisions. See <EM>Kelly</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As a result, the courts have characterized the IAP as a &ldquo;closed process&rdquo; and &ldquo;a complete code.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at paras. 23, 178; <EM>Spanish CA</EM>, at para. 53; <EM>N.N.</EM> at para. 78; <CASEREF><SOC>The Attorney General of Canada v JW and Reo Law Corporation et al</SOC><CITE>2017 MBCA 54</CITE><PARANUM>48</PARANUM></CASEREF> [MBCA Reasons], A.R.

<BLOCK3><N>vi.</N><TI>Directions on the interpretation and application of the IAP Model</TI>
<P>32. While there is no provision for the appeal of IAP decisions to the courts on any basis, the parties agreed that specific guidance on the interpretation and application of the IAP Model can be provided by the parties themselves. The IAP Oversight Committee is established pursuant to Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, section III(r) of the IRSSA, and consists of a chair and 8 other members, 2 from each of the following constituencies: former students (represented by the Assembly of First Nations and the Inuit Representatives), plaintiffs' counsel (including Independent Counsel and the National Consortium), church entities (including Protestant churches and Catholic entities), and government. The IAP Oversight Committee may give instructions on the &ldquo;interpretation and application of the IAP Model&rdquo; (Sch. D, art. III(r)(iii)).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Many examples of Chief Adjudicator Directives (CADs) and Guidance Papers (GPs) approved by the IAP Oversight Committee are available on the IAP website: <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/legal/directives-eng.php</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Chief Adjudicator can prepare such recommendations to be considered for approval by the IAP Oversight Committee (Sch.

<BLOCK3><N>vii.</N><TI>Legal fees in the IAP</TI>
<P>33. The Implementation Orders limit the legal fees that lawyers may charge for assisting claimants in the IAP. These orders also set out a process whereby claimants can seek a review by the Chief Adjudicator of the reasonableness of fees that are charged. These provisions emanated not from an agreement by the parties, but as a result of concerns raised by Winkler R.S.J. in approving the IRSSA, to which the parties did not object.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v.

<BLOCK3><N>viii.</N><TI>The IAP claim in this case</TI>
<P>34. The IAP claim in this case, dated April 4, 2012, initially alleged only physical abuse resulting in hearing loss. An allegation of sexual abuse was added four days before the claim was heard on May 26, 2014.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Decision W-15063, at para. 1, A.R.. Tab 1, p. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> After testimony was received, the hearing was adjourned for an expert medical assessment of whether there was evidence of a physical injury linked to the alleged physical abuse.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Decision W-15063, para. 4, A.R. Tab 1, p. 2. Physical abuse, as opposed to sexual abuse, is only compensable in the IAP if it has caused physical injury of a certain severity as explained in art. II and App. IX, (C)(1&ndash;4). As a result, a finding of physical abuse can only be made if there is evidence of a specified physical injury. Appendix VI(3) provides that if this evidence is not contained in the clinical notes or treatment records that are submitted by the claimant, the adjudicator is directed to ask the claimant to undergo an independent medical examination by an appropriate medical professional.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. The medical assessment, dated November 4, 2014, concluded that the claimant's hearing loss was not related to any alleged abuse at the residential school. As a result, when final submissions were made on February 4, 2015, the allegation of physical abuse was withdrawn and the only remaining allegation was that of sexual abuse at the SL 1.4 level.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Decision W-15063, para. 5, A.R. Tab 1, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. The initial adjudicator found the sexual assault was not proven and dismissed the claim.

<P>37. The claimant accessed both the review and re-review options within the IAP. At both levels, he argued essentially the same misapplication of the IAP Model by the initial adjudicator as is being argued to this Court.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II: POSITION ON THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE APPELLANTS</TI>
<P>39. The Chief Adjudicator's position on the issues raised by the appellants' factum is as follows:
<P1>(a) The IAP is the product of a settlement given effect by court orders. IAP adjudicators make determinations not as a result of a grant of authority from the legislature or the executive but by the agreement of the parties. Consequently, their decisions are not subject to judicial review. The parties intended to retain control over the specialized IAP process, including the interpretation of IAP terms, and there is no barrier to them doing so.</P1>
<P1>(b) Because the parties did not provide for any appeal to the courts, courts have no authority to take on the role the IRSSA specifically assigns to IAP adjudicators or review adjudicators. Disagreement with the interpretation or application of the IAP compensation rules by initial adjudicators, or with the application of the review criteria by review adjudicators, is not a basis for judicial intervention. There is no basis for a court to review IAP decisions for factual or interpretive error.</P1>
<P1>(c) The court's general supervisory authority over the IAP gives the court jurisdiction to provide remedies for IAP claimants only where it does not interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of IAP adjudicators. If an IAP re-review adjudicator makes a decision without regard to the criteria set out in the IAP, but instead on some other basis, a supervising judge can set aside the decision and send it back for determination in accordance with the criteria set out in the IAP. In addition, a supervising judge can order remedies that may lie outside of the jurisdiction of IAP adjudicators that are necessary to ensure the parties comply with the IAP and to ensure fair procedure in its administration.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III: STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>40. The facts set out above in Part I are not contentious. They demonstrate that the parties to the IAP agreed to a tailor-made claims adjudication process designed to address the specific circumstances of individual claims of abuse at residential schools. The parties agreed on compensation criteria that were meant to deliver awards to thousands of claimants, many of them elderly, in a timely manner. They adopted hearing procedures that differ significantly from court processes, and that were meant to provide an opportunity for vulnerable claimants to tell their stories and pursue their claims while strictly protecting their privacy and minimizing additional trauma. The parties retained control over the qualifications for and appointment of adjudicators to decide individual claims. Through the Implementation Orders, the supervising courts sought to ensure that claimants could access legal counsel at a reasonable cost. Unlike the provisions for CEP payments, the parties did not provide for any access to the courts for an appeal of decisions made within the IAP. Instead, the parties agreed on two levels of internal review, conducted by review and re-review adjudicators, selected by the parties themselves. They also agreed on a pro cess whereby the parties themselves through the Oversight Committee could provide direction regarding the interpretation and application of the IAP compensation rules.</P>
<P>41. Based on these facts, the original eastern administrative judge,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Request for Directions from the Chief Adjudicator of the Independent Assessment Process and Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</EM>, unreported, March 7, 2011, Court File No. 00-CV-192059CP (ONSC) [<EM>Schachter SC</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the current western administrative judge,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Manitoba Court of Appeal,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Ontario Court of Appeal,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter CA</EM>; <EM>Spanish CA</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the British Columbia Court of Appeal,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>N.N.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> have all found that the parties to the IRSSA intended specially trained adjudicators, and not judges, to interpret and apply the agreed upon compensation criteria. The parties did not intend that after exhausting the initial adjudication and both levels of review, claimants or Canada could then ask courts to undertake the same exercise carried out by review and re-review adjudicators, and then appeal that two more times until the matter reached this Court.</P>
<P>42. These courts have all agreed that such decisions are not subject to either judicial review or appeal. Judicial review is not available because IAP adjudicators are not exercising any state power, but rather are acting pursuant to the contract agreed to by the parties and given effect by court order. There is no appeal because the parties, in setting out the detailed provisions regarding the operation of the IAP, did not provide for any appeal to the courts.</P>
<P>43. The function of the courts in supervising the IAP is not to review individual decisions for error or unreasonableness. Rather, the court's role is to ensure that the IAP adjudicators who have exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations are doing so by considering the terms of the IAP. Claimants were promised a process based on specialized criteria, and adjudicators must apply that process. As stated by the Court below: &ldquo;there is an important distinction to be dr awn between the failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders, on the one hand, and the correctness/reasonableness of the interpretation or application of those terms, on the other.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for judgment, Manitoba Court of Appeal, at para 42, A.R., Vol. 1, page 69. at para. 42.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. Put more simply, supervision of the IAP means ensuring that adjudicators do the job assigned to them by the parties, but it does not involve evaluating whether adjudicators have done so correctly, reasonably, or in the same way a court would do. The latter function has been exclusively assigned by the parties to the review adjudicators, the Chief Adjudicator, and the Oversight Committee. As anticipated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Schachter</EM>, it is perhaps &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; that this review jurisdiction will ever be engaged, because it is to be expected that re-review adjudicators, whose decisions courts will be reviewing, will make those decisions having regard to the criteria in the IAP. As a result, the circumstances for judicial intervention have been characterized as &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;.</P>
<P>45. Since <EM>Schachter</EM>, a second kind of exceptional circumstance that can trigger the supervisory jurisdiction of the court over the IAP has been identified. The courts can use their general powers of supervision to provide remedies that may be beyond the authority of IAP adjudicators, but which ensure compliance with obligations under the IAP and fair procedure. For example, adjudicators have no power to order production of documents and a supervising judge may order a party comply with their obligations for production under the IRSSA. Similarly, once an IAP claim is completed and the internal reviews exhausted, there is no process set out in the IAP for an adjudicator to reopen cases to consider evidence that should have been previously disclosed. In such a circumstance, a supervising judge may exercise its supervisory powers to order a reopening of the claim to consider evidence that should have been previously disclosed. This is not the court engaging in the interpretive or fact-finding process that is the responsibility of IAP adjudicators. Nor does it involve the court performing an error-correcting function with respect to the decision of a review or re-review adjudicator. Instead, the court utilizes its supervisory jurisdiction to provide an appropriate remedy that ensures the integrity of the IAP, while respecting the exclusive jurisdiction of IAP adjudicators to interpret and apply the compensation criteria.</P>
<P>46. Now, at a time when the IAP is nearly complete, the appellants assert that all of the appellate courts who have considered this issue have erred, and that this Court should find that individual decisions of IAP adjudicators are subject to court review. This assertion contains a number of fundamental errors.</P>
<P>47. The appellants correctly identify the sources of the court's supervisory jurisdiction over the implementation of the settlement itself: the terms of the IRSSA, the class proceedings legislation, the Implementation and Approval Orders, and the court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own processes. But the appellants conflate general supervisory jurisdiction over the implementation of the agreement with the ability to review the substantive decisions of individual IAP adjudicators for interpretative or factual error.</P>
<P>48. The appellants rest their argument mainly on the assertion that judicial review is available and that as a result courts can and indeed must review IAP decisions for reasonableness. This argument fails to give effect to the fundamental fact that the IAP is created and implemented through an agreement by the parties, and not pursuant to the exercise of any legislative or executive power.</P>
<P>49. In the alternative, the appellants argue that the exceptional circumstances test for judicial recourse adopted by the appellate courts permits any claimant to ask a court to review an IAP adjudicator's decision for reasonableness. This essentially claims a right to appeal, albeit on a somewhat deferential standard. But the IAP does not provide for any such appeal. The appellants' argument fails to respect the parties' decision to develop a <EM>sui generis</EM> compensation scheme to be carried out under procedures developed by them. Instead, the appellants would graft on potentially three additional layers of court appeals after a re-review adjudicator issues his or her decision.</P>
<P>50. The appellants argue in the further alternative that the Court below failed to show appropriate deference to the supervising judge's determination that &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; existed. In fact, the supervising judge undertook the wrong inquiry, based on his mistaken understanding that the IRSSA conferred a &ldquo;general curial review&rdquo; jurisdiction which permitted the court to take on the role assigned by the IAP to review and re-review adjudicators. In these circumstances, no deference is required because the supervising judge misdirected himself as to the appropriate test.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>53. The IRSSA has the force of law not because of any administrative or legislative act by the government, but as a result of a court order issued to give effect to a contractual settlement of private law claims in tort. IAP adjudicators exercise powers granted to them by contract, and they do not exercise any statutory powers. IAP adjudicators, who are themselves appointed by consensus of the parties to the contract, apply the compensation rules agreed to by the parties in the contract, utilizing the procedure agreed to by the parties in the contract. The fact that the contract was approved by court order does not transform the operation of this private settlement into a public act.</P>
<P>54. The question of whether IAP adjudicators' decisions could be subject to judicial review was first addressed in <EM>Schachter SC</EM> by Chief Justice Winkler, who had previously issued the order in <EM>Baxter</EM>, the lead decision approving the IRSSA. He held:
<QUOTE><P>The argument regarding judicial review similarly has a fatal flaw. The reality is that the Chief Adjudicator, in conducting a paragraph 19 review, is acting pursuant to the terms of orders issued by nine superior courts. The courts issued those orders through the exercise of jurisdiction arising from the pertinent statutes, rules of court and, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Dutton</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 46</CITE><PARANUM>34</PARANUM></CASEREF> the &ldquo;inherent power to settle the rules of practice and procedure as to disputes brought before them ...&rdquo;. Judicial review may be available where a statutory power of decision has been exercised by an inferior tribunal, but a superior court does not judicially review its own order. Here, where the Chief Adjudicator is acting pursuant to a term of the orders issued by superior courts, he cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision subject to judicial review.</P>
<P>Further, it must be remembered that the right to have a claim assessed in the IAP, or for counsel to receive fees in respect of that assessment, are incidents of the Settlement Agreement and the terms of orders approving and implementing that Settlement. Class members were given an opportunity to opt out of the Settlement. Those who chose to advance claims through the Settlement are bound by its terms, as are the counsel who choose to represent them. Moreover, they are bound by all of the terms of the Settlement and cannot attempt to expand upon them to serve their own purposes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter SC</EM>, at paras. 19-20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. In <EM>Schachter CA</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld this point, stating:
<QUOTE><P>The Administrative Judge also correctly concluded that there is no right to seek judicial review from a legal fee review decision of the Chief Adjudicator. The court's jurisdiction to issue a declaration under s. 2(1)2 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1 (the &ldquo;JRPA&rdquo;) relates only to &ldquo;the exercise, refusal to exercise or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power&rdquo;. As the Administrative Judge explained, the Chief Adjudicator is not exercising a statutory power of decision, but rather renders his fee review appeal decision pursuant to the authority derived from the implementation orders, as approved by the relevant provincial and territorial superior courts.</P>
<P>The appellant further contends that the office of the Chief Adjudicator is a quasi&mdash;judicial public body that is subject to judicial review proceedings by way of an application for an order in the nature of mandamus or certiorari under s. 2(1)2 of the JRPA. I do not agree with this assertion. Judicial review is not available to review the exercise of authority by a judicially created body, which has been given certain duties as provided by the terms of the [Settlement Agreement], and the implementation orders. The office of the Chief Adjudicator was created by order of the courts in approving the negotiated terms of settlement of class action litigation. The authority of that office is exercised in relation to those class members who have elected to advance claims through the IAP and their counsel. The terms of the [Settlement Agreement] and the implementation orders set out the process for reviewing decisions of the IAP Adjudicators. Recourse to the courts is only available if it is provided for in the S.

<P>56. While <EM>Schachter</EM> involved the issue of judicial recourse from a decision made by the Chief Adjudicator in the fee review process established by the Implementation Orders, the same principle applies to IAP compensation decisions.

<P>57. The appellants argue that the right to judicial review of decisions of IAP adjudicators is grounded in the court orders approving the IRSSA, the class proceedings statutes applicable to the IRSSA and the inherent jurisdiction of the courts. Essentially, they assert that because the courts have supervisory authority over the administration and implementation of the IAP, IAP adjudicators' decisions should be subject to judicial review in the same manner as decisions made by administrative tribunals established by statute.</P>
<P>58. These arguments misapprehend the very nature of judicial review. The appellants are critical of the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <EM>Schachter CA</EM>, stating that &ldquo;the rule against judicial review is simply asserted, without the citation of any authority for the rule and without any persuasive reasoning for it&rdquo; (appellants' factum, para. 62). With respect, the Ontario Court of Appeal was clear about the basis for its decision. The Chief Adjudicator does not exercise any statutory power of decision or any power granted by the executive. His authority comes from the agreement of the parties, given effect by court order.</P>
<P>59. Judicial review is grounded in ensuring respect for the roles of the legislature, the executive and the courts. At para. 48, the appellants quote from, but seem to fundamentally misunderstand, the following comments by Justice Deschamps in her concurring judgment in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>Parliament and the legislatures cannot totally exclude judicial oversight without overstepping the division between legislative or executive powers and judicial powers....Judicial review of administrative action is rooted in these fundamental principles and its boundaries are largely informed by the roles of the respective branches of government.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>&rdquo;), para. 159.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>60. At para. 49, the appellants speak about the &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo; of the IAP. But Justice Deschamps was not discussing the &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo; of a particular tribunal; she was talking about how the nature and scope of judicial review itself is framed by the relationship between the judicial and legislative branch. None of that applies to the IAP. The legislature cannot create a tribunal to make decisions on matters that affect the public and then exclude those decisions from court review. But that is not what happened in this case. Here, parties to an agreement to settle tort litigation created a means of distributing settlement proceeds based on determinations made in a specialized, closed process. There is no constitutional concern with the parties deciding not to provide a means of accessing the courts to review those compensation decisions.</P>
<P>61. This analysis does not change just because Canada is one of the parties to the IRSSA. If the participation of a government as a contracting party was enough to trigger judicial review, then any arbitration decision involving a government body would be subject to judicial review. This Court has recently recalled the distinction between a public body's &ldquo;private power&rdquo; and those that are &ldquo;central to the administrative mandate given to it by Parliament.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Highwood Congregation</EM>, at para. 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The necessary prerequisite to trigger judicial review is the source of the decision-maker's authority, not the identity of the parties.</P>
<P>62. The appellants argue that because the courts have supervisory authority over the implementation of the IRSSA generally, the principles of judicial review from cases such as <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> automatically apply, including the presumption that decisions will be subject to review on the basis of reasonableness. The appellants suggest that &ldquo;it is unnecessary for the courts to fashion a <EM>sui generis</EM> and <EM>ad hoc</EM> basis for judicial review in the IAP&rdquo; (appellants' factum, para. 50). However, the question of the respective roles of courts and IAP adjudicators engages not statutory interpretation but rather contract interpretation. These roles are determined not by the division between the legislative or executive and judicial branches of government, but by the intentions of the parties. The question is thus by its nature, <EM>sui generis</EM> or specific to the IRSSA.</P>
<P>63. It is true, as the appellants assert, that one of the sources of the <UNDER>courts'</UNDER> authority to supervise the implementation of the IRSSA is the class proceedings legislation. But the critical question in determining whether IAP decisions are subject to judicial review is not the source of the court's authority but that of the adjudicators whose decisions are at issue. The fact that the court has authority, in part as a result of statute, to supervise the implementation of the agreement, does not render the IAP itself a &ldquo;hybrid creation of statute, court order and agreement&rdquo; as alleged by the appellants.</P>
<P>64. The appellants suggest that because the supervisory court has jurisdiction, and indeed an obligation, to ensure that class members receive the &ldquo;promised benefits&rdquo; of the IRSSA, this means that the court has an obligation to review the decision of every IAP claimant who requests it, presumably to determine whether the claimant is receiving the compensation &ldquo;promised&rdquo; by the IRSSA.</P>
<P>65. Courts do not have any jurisdiction, let alone an obligation, to ensure that each claimant receives the compensation that a court would consider them to be entitled to. This would involve the courts, and not the decision-makers chosen by the parties, applying the IAP compensation rules. What the IRSSA promised individual claimants, and what the courts must ensure they receive, is not a specific level of compensation, but &ldquo;a contractual right to have compensable claims adjudicated under the negotiated IAP.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>N.N.</EM> at para. 83.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That promise includes the assessment of compensation by adjudicators selected by the parties. The general supervisory jurisdiction of the courts provides them with the ability to ensure that this contractual commitment is fulfilled. This, however, does not involve the courts engaging in judicial review.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The supervisory jurisdiction of the Court does not authorize appeals</TI>
<P>66. The appellants argue, in the alternative, that since the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Schachter</EM>, it is recognized that the Court's general supervisory role over the IRSSA provides authority to intervene in IAP cases in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; and that an unreasonable interpretation of the IAP constitutes an exceptional circumstance. In effect, the appellants' argument amounts to an assertion that the parties intended that individual IAP determinations could be appealed to the courts on a deferential standard of reasonableness. This is not what the cases have held, and the appellants' assertion is not supported by an examination of the IRSSA.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>Decisions of Chief Justice Winkler and the <EM>Schachter</EM> case</TI>
<P>67. From the inception of the IAP, courts have recognized that court supervision of the IRSSA's implementation is distinct from the question of whether courts can review individual IAP decisions.</P>
<P>68. The need for a process for court supervision of the IRSSA was recognized by Winkler R.S.J .'s judgment in <EM>Baxter</EM> which is the lead set of reasons approving the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Baxter</EM>, at para 81.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE><EM>Baxter</EM> led to the Implementation Orders, including provision for the RFD court protocol. In two subsequent decisions, then Chief Justice Winkler made it very clear that the RFD process could not be used as a further level of appeal or substantive review of IAP decisions.</P>
<P>69. The first attempt to utilize the RFD process to review or appeal a decision made in the IAP involved a fee review decision made by the Chief Adjudicator's designate under the fee review process that was also established in the Implementation Orders. In the first level decision, <EM>Schachter SC</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>This RFD was brought jointly by the Schachter law firm and the Chief Adjudicator. The Chief Adjudicator sought general directions regarding the extent to which IAP legal fee reviews conducted by him or his designate are subject to any further appeal; if there is a right to further appeal, to whom the appeal lies; and the nature of such appeal (para. 8). The Schachter law firm also sought directions specific to a particular fee review decision by the Chief Adjudicator (para. 9).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Chief Justice Winkler held that the Ontario Approval Order was the &ldquo;final order of judgment with respect to the litigation&rdquo; regardless of the fact that it created a claims adjudication process (para. 15). After the appeal period for the Approval Order expired, &ldquo;the only appeal rights from decisions rendered under the claims administration and assessment process in respect of individual claims are those expressly set out in the terms of the order&rdquo; (para. 17). Then Chief Justice Winkler noted, at para. 20:
<QUOTE><P>Further, it must be remembered that the right to have a claim assessed in the IAP, or for counsel to receive fees in respect of that assessment, are incidents of the Settlement Agreement and the terms of orders approving and implementing that Settlement. Class members were given an opportunity to opt out of the Settlement. Those who chose to advance claims through the Settlement are bound by its terms, as are the counsel who choose to represent them. Moreover, they are bound by all of the terms of the Settlement and cannot attempt to expand upon them to serve their own purposes.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>70. He also held, at para. 22:
<QUOTE><P>Further, no right of appeal can be grounded on the supervisory jurisdiction that the courts have over the implementation of the Settlement and the Settlement Orders. In other words, there is no implicit right to appeal each determination made within the context of the claims administration or assessment process as an incident of the judicial oversight function.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>71. Chief Justice Winkler later considered another RFD based on an allegation of bias made against an adjudicator.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Unreported, September 26, 2011, Court File No.00-CV-192059CP [&ldquo;<EM>SSJSSM RFD</EM>&rdquo;]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He held, at para. 22:
<QUOTE><P>Once the Chief Adjudicator has rendered his or her review decision, the provisions for review within the Settlement Agreement are exhausted. There is no further right of appeal. While the supervising courts maintain jurisdiction over the settlement and its implementation, a supervisory jurisdiction does not give a party to the settlement a general right of appeal, in the absence of specific language in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement contains no such right.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>72. According to Chief Justice Winkler, there was no room at all for judicial interference with the holdings of IAP adjudicators. When <EM>Schachter SC</EM> was appealed, the Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed that the IRSSA provided no ability to bring a judicial review or an appeal of an IAP decision and then stated (<EM>per</EM> Rouleau J.A. at para. 53):
<QUOTE><P>I turn now to whether a process, other than an appeal or judicial review, is available to review a decision by the Chief Adjudicator. The Administrative Judge properly confirmed that the IAP Adjudicators &ldquo;<UNDER>cannot ignore</UNDER>&rdquo; the provisions of the implementation orders and that &ldquo;it remains necessary for Adjudicators to <UNDER>apply the required factors</UNDER>&rdquo; when conducting a legal fee review at first instance. In the perhaps unlikely event that the final decision of the Chief Adjudicator reflects a <UNDER>failure to consider</UNDER> the terms of the S. A. and implementation orders, including the factors set out in para. 18 of the implementation orders, then, in my view, the parties to the S.A. intended that there be some judicial recourse. Having said that, I emphasize my agreement with the Administrative Judge's comment, at para. 22 of his reasons, that &ldquo;there is no implicit right to appeal each determination made within the context of the claims administration or assessment process as an incident of the judicial oversight function&rdquo;. As I will go on to explain, the right to seek judicial recourse is limited to very exceptional circumstances. (Emphasis added.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. The Court held, at para. 57, that the RFD process could be used to review a decision only where there was a &ldquo;failure to comply with the terms of the [Settlement Agreement] or the implementation orders.&rdquo; By way of example, the Court noted that the Implementation Orders set out the factors to be considered in conducting a fee review, and held that a refusal to consider those factors would be reviewable by way of RFD.</P>
<P>74. The Court held, at paras. 54 and 58:
<QUOTE><P>The parties intended that implementation of the S. A. be expeditious and not mired in delay and procedural disputes. As noted by the Chief Adjudicator, there are already many checks and balances in place to ensure that the process is administered fairly and in accordance with the terms of the S.A. The Chief Adjudicator is granted broad discretion by the terms of the S. A. (para. 54)</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Before leaving this issue, I note that I agree with the Chief Adjudicator's submission that allowing a party to request directions when it is alleged that the Chief Adjudicator's decision reflects a failure to apply the terms of the implementation orders raises concerns about finality, efficiency and has the potential to overburden the Administrative Judges. However, I am satisfied that these concerns are alleviated by the clear limits on when such a request is available. Moreover, the Administrative Judges who hear such requests are well aware of the concerns that led to the adoption of the implementation orders, namely, the need to protect vulnerable claimants and the need for timely resolution of disputes in light of the advanced age of many claimants: see Baxter, at paras. 74 and 85 (para. 58).</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>75. Thus, <EM>Schachter CA</EM> established a court could interfere with an IAP adjudicator's decision only where the adjudicator failed to consider or apply the terms of the IAP, a circumstance it characterized as exceptional and unlikely. This does not involve the court in reviewing for error the findings made by adjudicators. Rather, the court is ensuring that adjudicators act with a view to implementing the IAP's terms.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>Cases since <EM>Schachter</EM></TI>
<P>76. The appellants' factum, at para. 74, purports to review the cases which have addressed court review of IAP decisions, and suggests that the period 2012 to 2016 &ldquo;is characterized by supervising court decisions that continue to make determinations about the reasonableness of adjudicator decisions in the IAP, notwithstanding <EM>Schachter</EM>&rdquo;. With respect, this is a serious mischaracterization of what occurred. First, it is unclear how courts could have &ldquo;continued&rdquo; to review IAP decisions for reasonableness when no court had yet done so. Chief Justice Winkler and the Ontario Court of Appeal had each specifically held that such a review was not available.</P>
<P>77. Second, the appellants entirely fail to mention the decision of Justice Nation in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 225</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;<EM>Grouard</EM>&rdquo;]. In that case, Justice Nation held that as long as an adjudicator interpreting the IAP acts within his or her jurisdiction, the decision should not be interfered with by a court. The question at issue was whether or not IAP adjudicators have the jurisdiction to determine when an institution listed in the IRSSA ceased to operate as an IRS. Justice Nation concluded that they indeed had the jurisdiction to interpret the IRSSA to determine whether or not an institution fell within the IRSSA.</P>
<P>78. Justice Nation then went on to conclude that as long as the adjudicator acted within his or her jurisdiction, the court was not required to review the substance of the decision. She held &ldquo;[t]he IAP is established by the IRSSA and that agreement makes no provision for any appeal or review to this or any of the supervising courts of the decisions made in that process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Grouard</EM> at para. 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. The appellants in fact cite only one case between 2012 and 2015 where the court reviewed an IAP decision for reasonableness. In <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al v. Canada (Attorney General) et al</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Resident's Decision</EM>&rdquo;), at paragraph 51, Justice Schulman held that because of conflicting decisions of IAP adjudicators, and because the matter was of the &ldquo;utmost importance,&rdquo; it fell within the exceptional circumstances outlined in <EM>Schachter CA</EM>. In the case at bar, the Manitoba Court of Appeal specifically declined to follow the <EM>Resident's Decision</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at para. 68, A.R. Tab 6, p. 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>80. Moreover, Justice Schulman revisited the issue of access to the courts in <EM>REO #1</EM>, which was released after the <EM>Grouard</EM> decision. That decision, which involved the review of legal fees of the appellant law firm in the present case, seems to accept that a disagreement in interpretation is not sufficient to trigger the court's limited jurisdiction on an RFD to review whether an adjudicator failed &ldquo;to enforce the provisions of the IRSSA or the Implementation Orders.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>REO #1</EM>, at para. 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It also expressly acknowledges that neither appeals nor judicial reviews are available to a claimant or lawyer who acts for a claimant under the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>REO</EM> #1, at para. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>81. The appellants rely on <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;<EM>Spanish SC</EM>&rdquo;) as an example of courts &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; to review substantive IAP decisions for reasonableness. In that case, the eastern administrative judge, Justice Perell, held that supervisory courts have a &ldquo;general curial review&rdquo; jurisdiction with respect to IAP adjudicators' decisions. Justice Edmond relied on that general curial review jurisdiction as the basis for his authority to set aside the IAP re-review adjudicator's decision in the case under appeal. However, Justice Brown, and all appellate courts who have considered the question have held that no such error-correcting jurisdiction exists.</P>
<P>82. In <EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, Justice Brown heard RFDs from five claimants dissatisfied with the results of their IAP claims. She noted that in hearing the five together, it became apparent that while each appeared &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; they were in fact difficult to distinguish from &ldquo;ordinary appeals.&rdquo; Justice Brown confirmed that the appropriate test for court intervention, or &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; was that set out in <EM>Schachter</EM>. In the course of her decision, she noted that: &ldquo;Despite my years of administering the IRSSA, it would be impossible for me to know better than those who have been immersed in the IAP since the IRSSA, and with it the IAP Model, were implemented.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, at para. 180.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>83. Soon after, in <EM>Spanish CA</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned Justice Perell's holding that there was a general curial review jurisdiction and confirmed their agreement with Justice Brown's analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish CA</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In their respective decisions, both Justice Brown and Sharpe J.A. held that a standard of review analysis is untenable in the IAP context.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish CA</EM>, para. 52; <EM>Bundled RFD</EM>, para 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The court is not engaged in an appeal or judicial review, where the court might assess the correctness of a holding or whether the decision maker's reasoning and result fell within a range of reasonable outcomes. Rather, the court's role is to ensure that those decision-makers who have exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and apply the IAP in the context of individual claims are carrying out the tasks which the parties have assigned to them.</P>
<P>84. Justice Sharpe held that Justice Perell had erred by reviewing the substance of the IAP adjudicators' decisions for error. Justice Sharpe found that when a supervising judge engages in &ldquo;a detailed review of the factual findings made by the Adjudicator&rdquo; this leads to the court assuming &ldquo;a role the IAP specifically assigns to the Review Adjudicator.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish CA</EM>, at para. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In particular, Sharpe J.A. emphasized that &ldquo;disagreement with the result reached does not equate to a failure to enforce the IRSSA agreement or apply the IAP model, thereby justifying judicial intervention. If it did, all IAP decisions would be appealable to the courts, the very thing <EM>Schachter</EM> forbids.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish CA</EM>, at para. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>85. Sharpe J.A. acknowledged in <EM>Spanish CA</EM> that &ldquo;the administrative judge was motivated by a genuine and sincere desire to see that justice was done in this particular case.&rdquo; He went on to caution that &ldquo;doing justice, however, involves more than going straight to what the judge thinks is the right result. Justice requires that procedural rules and jurisdictional boundaries designed to protect the rights of all parties be respected.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish CA</EM>, at para. 63.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. The Ontario Court of Appeal's approach was adopted by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in the present case. Courts cannot succumb to the temptation to review the substantive determinations of IAP adjudicators in an effort to address what may be perceived as an error. The entire IAP is pre mised on delivering settlement benefits in a timely and manageable way, by moving cases out of court and into a custom-designed process. The court's role in this context is to ensure that the exclusive jurisdiction of the adjudicators is exercised in manner that has regard to the IAP compensation rules, as those are understood by adjudicators.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>The court's general supervisory authority can be used to supplement, not supersede, the ability of IAP adjudicators to ensure fairness and compliance with obligations in the IAP</TI>
<P>87. In addition to intervening when adjudicators fail to carry out their functions under the IAP, the supervising court also has a role supplement the remedial authority of IAP adjudicators. This h as arisen primarily in unanticipated situations where the fairness and proper implementation of the IAP is at stake.</P>
<P>88. Following <EM>Schachter CA</EM>, Justice Perell concluded that the supervisory jurisdiction of the court permitted it to order Canada to comply with its disclosure obligations under the IAP, a power which IAP adjudicators do not have.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 283</CITE><PARANUM>206-207</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Spanish SC</EM>, he further concluded, and Canada agreed, that the remedial jurisdiction of the supervising court described in <EM>Schachter CA</EM> permitted the remittal of a claim for rehearing in the circumstance of dispositive newly discovered evidence.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Rather than providing that remedy, he revisited and corrected the decision himself which the Court of Appeal reversed.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>89. Since the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision under appeal was issued, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has endorsed the <EM>Schachter</EM> approach, and has also identified a role for the court's supervisory jurisdiction in supplementing the authority of adjudicators to issue remedies for IAP claimants disadvantaged by late disclosure in the IAP.</P>
<P>90. Two of the claimants in the <EM>Bundled RFD</EM> case appealed the dismissal of their RFDs. In <EM>N.N.</EM>, decided after the decision of the Court below in the case at bar, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld Justice Brown's finding that the <EM>Schachter</EM> test was the applicable approach. Justice MacKenzie, for the majority, stated:
<QUOTE><P>In my view, the judge correctly recognized the need to ensure that &ldquo;finality is preserved and the expertise of the Chief Adjudicator and those under his supervision is recognized&rdquo; (at para. 178). This is consistent with Sharpe J.A.'s conclusion in Spanish IRS, which I repeat for ease of reference:
<QUOTE><P>[51] ... The IAP represents a comprehensive, tailor-made scheme for the resolution of claims by trained and experienced adjudicators, selected according to specified criteria and working under the direction of the Chief Adjudicator. Allowing appeals or judicial review to the courts from IAP decisions is not contemplated by the IAP, the IRSSA or the Implementation Orders. Allowing appeals or judicial review would seriously compromise the finality of the IAP and fail to pay appropriate heed to the distinctive nature of the IAP and the expertise of IAP adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>N.N.</EM>, at para. 81. In dissent, Justice Hunter endorsed the <EM>Schachter</EM> test, but would have dismissed the appeal on the basis that Justice Brown was entitled to deference on the issue of whether the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; test was met.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>91. Justice Mackenzie held, however, that Brown J. had erred in her application of the <EM>Schachter</EM> test with respect to one RFD. That case involved the impact of a newly discovered document on an IAP claim. Justice Brown had held that the new evidence would not likely have made any difference to the outcome of the claim. Justice MacKenzie found that Justice Brown has misapprehended the significance of the new evidence. Because of the likelihood that the new evidence would affect the outcome of the hearing, she held that the claimant had established &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; that required a new hearing.</P>
<P>92. In ordering a new hearing, Justice MacKenzie found that any other result would be contrary to the principles of natural justice, and inconsistent with the IRSSA's objectives. She held, at para. 167:
<QUOTE><P>There is no question that access to judicial recourse is very limited. The courts have interpreted it as requiring very exceptional circumstances. However, as observed in Fontaine SCC at para. 5, the IRSSA is a comprehensive settlement that seeks to achieve a &ldquo;fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools&rdquo; and aims to promote &ldquo;healing, education, truth and reconciliation and commemoration&rdquo;. Ultimately, the IRSSA requires a balance be struck between efficiency and finality on the one hand, and fairness on the other.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>93. This did not involve the court in interfering with the re-review adjudicator's decision, because the re-review adjudicator had held that he had no jurisdiction to consider the new evidence, a position that has been taken by some, but not all, IAP adjudicators.</P>
<P>94. Justice Mackenzie is surely correct that the elaborate adjudication system devised by the parties entitles IAP claimants to a level of natural justice and procedural fairness. While Justice MacKenzie held that only a court can order the reopening of <UNDER>concluded</UNDER> claims (where the internal levels of review within the IAP have been exhausted), she did not specifically address the question of whether review or re-review adjudicators are able to order <UNDER>ongoing</UNDER> cases to be reopened to consider newly discovered evidence. IAP review and re-review adjudicators have not been consistent on this point, and the question is currently before the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in an appeal of decision by Justice Brown that IAP adjudicators have no such authority.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Procedural Fairness RFD</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It would appear that the better approach is to find that the parties intended the IAP to be procedurally fair and that IAP adjudicators can apply the relevant principles while the review process is ongoing. This is consistent with Chief Justice Winkler's ruling in the SSJSSM RFD and both the majority and dissenting justices in <EM>N.N</EM>, that an allegation of bias falls squarely within the ambit of the review and re-review mandate and, when responded to accordingly, is not an exceptional circumstance triggering jurisdiction for judicial recourse.</P>
<P>95. However, if the need arises for a remedy after the IAP review process is complete (for example, if relevant evidence is discovered after that time) this is an appropriate &ldquo;exceptional circumstance&rdquo; in which judicial recourse would be available. This would involve the court's supervisory authority being utilized in a way to fill in the gaps left by the IAP provisions, which is an appropriate role for a supervising court. This is very different than what the appellants in this case propose.</P>
<P>96. If review and re-review adjudicators can effectively consider and give effect to principles of fair procedure within the internal review processes, then the supervising courts' jurisdiction to address these matters is appropriately limited to exceptional cases. If only the courts can consider these matters, however, then the court's jurisdiction may well be broader when these issues are at stake. The Chief Adjudicator submits that the more coherent and better approach is to recognize that review and re-review adjudicators are also bound to apply principles of fair procedure in the IAP, such that only in exceptional circumstances will courts be required to intervene in IAP decisions on that basis.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iv.</N><TI>The parties did not intend for individual IAP claims to be appealed to the Court</TI>
<P>97. Finding a general right of appeal from compensation decisions, or seeking a ruling that adjudicators have erred in the application of the IAP, is not &ldquo;filling in a gap&rdquo; in the IRSSA. The parties must be taken to have turned their mind to the question of whether any appeal should be available, given that one was specifically provided from CEP decisions and not for those arising from the IAP, and given that making such appeals available would significantly undermine the IRS SA's objectives.</P>
<P>98. Careful review of the IRSSA reveals that the parties exhaustively considered the circumstances in which the supervising court would be engaged. As noted, individual CEP determinations can be appealed to the court<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, art. 5.09(2), p. 49. See also IRSSA, art. 5.04(3), p. 45, which permits the Court to order deadline extensions for CEP applications; no similar provision is provided for the IAP deadline.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but there is no parallel provision for IAP claims. The parties also permitted applications to the court regarding the addition of institutions to Schedule F,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, art. 4.11(12)(1), p. 38 and art. 12.01(5), p. 64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the determination of disputes involving the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, art. 7.01(3), p. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and various administrative matters.</P>
<P>99. Indeed, there are only two IRSSA provisions involving access to the courts related to the IAP. The first permits such access if it is necessary to modify the IAP to ensure that claims can be processed at the volumes set out in article 6.03(3) of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, art. 4.11(12)(q), p. 39 and art. 6.03(3), p. 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The second permits the Chief Adjudicator to grant access to the courts in three specific and defined circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sch. D, art. III(b)(iii), p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>100. These extensively negotiated and carefully drafted exceptions indicate the parties' intention that the IAP would be a closed process, with decisions to be made by adjudicators and not by courts. The parties intended that court involvement might be necessary not to interpret Schedule D but rather to ensure that adjudicators and the Secretariat could in fact implement the IAP in the manner the parties intended, and to achieve the intended result of determining thousands of claims in a relatively short time period. Opening up every IAP decision to judicial review would in fact undermine the parties' stated intention of resolving a minimum of 2,500 claims per year and processing each claim within nine months of being admitted to the process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IRSSA, art. 6.03(1)(a), p. 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>101. Likewise, the parties foresaw that interpretive direction might be needed in the IAP, but they entrusted this function not to the courts but to the IAP Oversight Committee (subject to approval by the NAC).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sch. D, art. III(r)(iii), p. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This procedure reflects the consensus-driven approach towards the IAP that is also seen in the selection and training of adjudicators. It is also consistent with the express provision that there is to be no <EM>stare decisis</EM> in the IAP,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sch. D, App. X, s. 5, p. 42.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and that any changes in interpretation should only bind those who have two weeks' advance notice before their hearing.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sch. D, III(r)(iii), p. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>102. Conversely, other class action settlement agreements make express permission for appeals to the supervising courts from claims determination processes. For example, the Pre-1986/Post-1990 Hepatitis C Settlement Agreement allows for an appeal to the supervising court on limited grounds.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Desjardins c. Canada (Procureur g&ea;n&ea;ral)</SOC><CITE>2010 QCCS 1252</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>The case before this Court does not involve &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo;</TI>
<P>103. The appellants' primary argument is that Ontario Court of Appeal erred in <EM>Schachter CA</EM> by holding that judicial review was not available to IAP claimants. In the alternative, they argue that the <EM>Schachter</EM> test of exceptional circumstances is met in this case because the IAP adjudicators failed to apply the IAP to the claimant's claim.</P>
<P>104. Justice Edmond stated that his jurisdiction was limited to &ldquo;ensuring that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB Reasons, at para. 40, A.R. Tab 4, p. 40</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At first blush, this may sound like the judge construed his jurisdiction narrowly. However, when the totality of the decision is considered, it is clear that, relying on Justice Perell's holding in <EM>Spanish</EM> SC that a supervising court exercises a general curial review jurisdiction over IAP decisions, Justice Edmond actually engaged in a detailed review of the decision of the initial adjudicator and identified what he believed to be errors in her analysis of whether the claimant had established sexual abuse at the SL1.4 level. He found that these errors were unreasonable, and that they should have been corrected by the review and re-review adjudicators. He then found that their alleged failure to do so constituted a &ldquo;misapplication of the IAP Model&rdquo; and that this was sufficient to enable him to set the re-review decision aside.</P>
<P>105. In so doing, the supervising judge committed precisely the same error as Justice Perell in <EM>Spanish SC</EM>: he improperly took on the role that the IRSSA assigns to review adjudicators. The supervising judge was entitled to consider whether the re-review adjudicator had conducted a review to determine whether there had been a misapplication of the IAP Model. If there had been no such review by the re-review adjudicator, there would have been a basis for finding that there had been a failure to apply the terms of the IAP. But disagreement with the outcome of the re-review cannot be sufficient to justify judicial intervention. If it were, all such decisions would be, in effect, subject to an appeal to the courts.</P>
<P>106. At para. 43, Justice Edmond stated the core of his conclusion:
<QUOTE><P>The decision of the Re-Review Adjudicator is inextricably tied to the Adjudicator's interpretation of SL1.4. If there was a misapplication of the IAP, and the Re-Review Adjudicator failed to correct it, then the IAP has not been properly applied.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>107. This passage makes it clear that the basis for intervention was solely the supervising judge's disagreement with the re-review adjudicator's analysis of whether the initial adjudicator had misapplied the IAP Model. He simply engaged in the same analysis assigned by the IAP to the IAP adjudicators and came to a different result. This is not an exceptional circumstance that provides a right to judicial recourse.</P>
<P>108. In <EM>Spanish CA</EM>, Justice Sharpe held, at para. 60:
<QUOTE><P>The administrative judge appears to have taken the view that if, in his judgment, M.F. was entitled to compensation, any other conclusion necessarily reflected a failure to apply the IAP model. In my respectful opinion, that approach reflects a failure to follow the strictures imposed in <EM>Schachter</EM> on recourse to the courts from IAP decisions, and one that, if accepted, could significantly undermine the finality and integrity of the IAP.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>109. Similarly, in this case, Justice Edmond appears to hold, at para. 39, that the fact that compensation was denied when he thought it should have been awarded was sufficient to justify setting aside the decisions of the three IAP adjudicators, all of whom carried out the roles assigned to them under the IAP. The fact that the judge disagreed with the adjudicators who denied the compensation cannot in itself be an exceptional circumstance justifying the court's interference with what the parties designed to be a closed process.</P>
<P>110. The appellants argue that any failure to apply the IAP terms in a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; manner amounts to a failure to apply the IAP's terms, justifying the court's intervention. This is what the appellants mean when they say at para. 92 of their factum that reasonableness is &ldquo;inescapable.&rdquo; They argue that the court must assess whether an adjudicator has &ldquo;meaningfully&rdquo; complied with the IAP rules. In effect, the appellants seek to restore the approach of Justice Perell in the <EM>Spanish RFD</EM> and of Justice Edmonds in this case&mdash;that is, that courts have a &ldquo;curial review jurisdiction&rdquo; that permits them to engage in an error correcting review of IAP decisions.</P>
<P>111. If the appellants are correct, supervising judges will be engaged in essentially the same exercise as reviewing adjudicators acting under the review provisions of the IAP. Their judgments would then be subject to further appeal, thus layering additional reviews on top of what is provided for in the IRSSA, in the context of a settlement agreement that provides no right of appeal or other judicial recourse from IAP decisions.</P>
<P>112. Ultimately, the question before the adjudicators was whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the claimant had discharged his burden to demonstrate that the incident he had experienced constituted sexual abuse at the SL1.4 level. This is a matter within the core of the exclusive jurisdiction of IAP adjudicators.</P>
<P>113. There can be no doubt that the parties expected that specially selected and trained adjudicators in the IAP would develop expertise applying the highly complex scheme set out in Sch. D. For interpretive questions involving the IAP Model, the framers of the IAP provided all parties with two levels of review by other adjudicators who would share that expertise. But they made no provision for any appeal to the courts on questions of law. This determination by the parties of the appropriate appeal mechanism must be given effect.</P>
<P>114. The role of the supervising courts is not to intervene to &ldquo;correct&rdquo; specific interpretations adopted by adjudicators. Rather, it is to ensure that decisions about the interpretation of the IAP are made by those to whom the task is assigned under the provisions agreed to by the parties.</P>
<P>115. The benefit provided by the IAP is the right to a <UNDER>closed</UNDER> adjudicative process to determine compensation. If an adjudicator decides a claim without considering the scheme set out in the IAP, the claimant would be denied the benefit of the settlement agreement. On the other hand, any disagreement with the substantive conclusions reached by adjudicators, whether on matters of fact or the interpretation of the IAP, can be addressed in the review procedures set out in the IAP, and if necessary, by the parties approving binding instructions to adjudicators following the process set out in Sch. D. There are already an extraordinary number of safeguards built in to ensure the integrity of the process, including internal rights of review and active oversight of the IAP by both the Oversight Committee and the NAC.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>The Manitoba Court of Appeal adopted an appropriate approach to the supervising judge's decision</TI>
<P>116. The appellants' factum argues, at paras. 99&ndash;101, that the Court below did not show appropriate deference to the supervising judge's decision that the <EM>Schachter</EM> test had been met. However, the supervising judge's finding proceeded from the basis of the fundamental error that there was a general curial review jurisdiction. His conclusion that the <EM>Schachter</EM> test was met therefore attracted no deference and the Court of Appeal made no error in rejecting it.</P>
<P>117. Furthermore, the appellants are relying on this Court's deferential review of Justice Perell's decision to order the destruction of IAP claim records in the <EM>IAP Records SCC</EM>, at paras. 39, 62-63. This Court was addressing appellate review of a discretionary exercise of supervisory jurisdiction to craft a necessary and appropriate order to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of claim as intended by the IRSSA. It was not extending deference to an erroneous understanding of the supervisory jurisdiction.</P>
<P>118. Even if an element of discretion were involved in the supervising judge's decision in this appeal, the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <EM>N.N.</EM>, at paras. 185-186, recognized that when an exercise of discretion is based on a misapprehension of law or fact, it is not entitled to significant deference.</P>
<P>119. The mistake made by the supervising judge in this case was fundamental, because he misapprehended the nature of the exercise he was engaged in. By applying reasonableness to a review of the substantive compensation and review decisions, the Court exceeded its supervisory role under the IRSSA and the class proceedings legislation. The supervising judge adopted the wrong test for determining whether judicial intervention in the IAP was authorized. While he utilized the term &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;, he engaged in a search for interpretive error that could apply in any IAP claim. As a result, his determination about whether the test was met is entitled to no deference.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>120. The parties to the IRSSA did not provide for an appeal or judicial review of the decisions of IAP adjudicators. Supervising judges cannot take on the roles assigned to IAP adjudicators, including review and re-review adjudicators. The courts' general supervisory jurisdiction requires courts to ensure that IAP adjudicators make decisions which have regard to the IAP provisions, and permits courts to issue orders which supplement the remedial jurisdiction of IAP adjudicators to ensure a fair process for claimants. It is expected that these forms of judicial relief will be appropriate only in exceptional circumstances. The IRSSA does not permit the substantive review of IAP compensation determinations, either on the basis of reasonableness or correctness.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. On May 8<SUP>th</SUP>, 2006 the Government of Canada, the AFN and legal counsel for the Plaintiffs and various church entities, entered into the historic Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (<BOLD>IRSSA</BOLD>). Two years later on June 11<SUP>th</SUP>, 2008, the Prime Minister of Canada issued an apology for the Indian Residential School system to address the darkest chapter in Canada history and to mark the implementation of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>2. The recitals of the IRSSA state that &ldquo;the parties desire fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of the Indian Residential Schools&rdquo; and: &ldquo;the parties further desire the promotion of healing, education, truth and reconciliation, and commemoration&rdquo;.</P>
<P>3. The process undertaken to achieve the IRSSA and, for that matter, the apology from the Prime Minister, was born out of a process of good-faith negotiations amongst the parties to the IRSSA not only to address a century of historic wrongs but also to define a new path forward towards reconciliation and resolution.</P>
<P>4. The issue that is raised in this appeal is whether this unique commercial agreement, the IRSSA, which was born in good faith should also be interpreted and performed in good faith. The Intervener, K.B., submits that the organizing principle outlined in this Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bhasin v. Hrynew</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 71</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Bhasin</EM></BOLD>) applies to the IRSSA.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED</TI>
<P>5. K.B.'s submissions will focus on two points:
<P1>1. should the organizing principle of good faith contractual interpretation and performance, along with the ensuing context specific duties, as articulated in <EM>Bhasin</EM>, apply to the IRSSA?</P1>
<P1>2. what are the implications of having the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principles apply to the IRSSA, and what duties should overlay the IRSSA to ensure good faith interpretation and performance?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Overview of <EM>Bhasin</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>6. <EM>Bhasin</EM> established that an organizing principle of good faith, and context specific duties apply to contracts in Canada. Justice Cromwell, at paragraph 33, identified two incremental steps in the common law of contract:</P>
<P>i) he acknowledged that there is a &ldquo;general organizing principle&rdquo; of good faith in contractual performance; and</P>
<P>ii) he recognized a general duty to act honestly in the performance of contractual obligations.</P>
<P>7. <EM>Bhasin</EM> does not create a rule of contractual interpretation, but rather a principle of contractual interpretation, and it is this principle of good faith that affords the Courts with the flexibility to apply this organizing principle to create duties depending upon two factors:
<P1>i) the context or factual matrix; and</P1>
<P1>ii) the relationship between the parties.</P1></P>
<P>8. Historically, contracts were premised on the idea of a discrete momentary transaction between two strangers, buying and selling a widget in a perfect market. However, many commercial contracts are, in fact, not that and are long-term relationships that deal with substantial commitments that cannot be fully particularized or anticipated in advance. This later type of contract requires a high degree of communication and cooperation, and a level of mutual trust, confidence and understanding.</P>
<P>9. Justice Cromwell makes it clear that good faith is not a panacea and it must be weighed along with other important principles of contract law. The weighing of these principles to achieve the proper and equitable result in each case, will enhance commercial certainty, rather than detract from it.</P>
<P>10. Many relational agreements are long term and forward looking. Future events or changes in circumstances may not have been anticipated, identified or negotiated. One would expect that in such circumstances the parties would have an obligation to engage with each other in a good faith process to deal with a changed or unforeseen circumstance.</P>
<P>11. If this good faith obligation on both the interpretation and performance of the agreement was absent, a chill would be put on trying to negotiate long-term relationship-based contracts, including settlement of class actions, because the parties would be required to cons ider every possible eventuality which would be very difficult, if not impossible to do.</P>
<P>12. This type of forward looking process would create a cumbersome and protracted process of trying to address risk allocation with a crystal ball&mdash;which is unlikely to lead to a resolution. The process of deal &lsquo;fatigue&rsquo; would, likely prevent an agreement from being concluded.</P>
<P>13. Context is central to determining what duties good faith requires of the parties, and of course, these duties themselves will apply in a context specific manner. What it means to be &lsquo;honest&rsquo; and &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; will depend on the parties' relationship and falls on a spectrum from a discrete single widget transaction to a long-term historical contract such as the IRSSA.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Should <EM>Bhasin</EM> principles apply to the IRSSA?</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. It is well-settled law that the IRSSA is a contract and the rules and principles of contractual interpretation apply to it. In <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 4585</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Fontaine</EM></BOLD>), the Court held:
<QUOTE><P>[67] The IRSSA is a contract, and as a contract, its interpretation is subject to the norms of the law of contract interpretation.</P>
<P>[68] The primary goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the intentions of the parties at the time the contract was made: <CASEREF><SOC>Skye Properties Ltd. v. Wu</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 499</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) at para. 79. The rules of contract interpretation direct a court to search for an interpretation from the whole of the contract that advances the intent of the parties at the time they signed the agreement: <CASEREF><SOC>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>1979 CanLII 10</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 888</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>15. <EM>Bhasin</EM> explains that, when interpreting commercial contracts in Canada, &ldquo;[t]he first step is to recognize that there is an organizing principle of good faith that underlies and manifests itself in various more specific doctrines governing contractual performance&rdquo; (<EM>Bhasin</EM>, at para 33). The individual duties which can overlay contractual performance are context specific, where certain areas of law (such as employment or franchise relationships for example) have imposed such doctrines to ensure equity and good faith performance. However, <EM>Bhasin</EM> illustrates that this list is flexible, not closed, and capable of adaptation to different contexts, whereby the list of applicable doctrines or duties will be expanded to ensure good faith performance as circumstances demand (<EM>Bhasin</EM>, at para 66).</P>
<P>16. <EM>Bhasin</EM> focuses on the duties of honest and fair performance and notes that contractual obligations cannot be performed &ldquo;capriciously or arbitrarily&rdquo; (<EM>Bhasin</EM>, at para 63). <EM>Bhasin</EM> explains that &ldquo;[g]ood faith may be invoked in widely varying contexts and this calls for a highly context-specific understanding of what honesty and reasonableness in performance require so as to give appropriate consideration to the legitimate interests of both contracting parties&rdquo; (<EM>Bhasin</EM>, at para 69).</P>
<P>17. The IRSSA was driven by a desire of the parties to develop and implement a good faith, non-litigious resolution framework to resolve more than 80,000 potential civil cases from survivors who had endured the Indian Residential Schools system.</P>
<P>18. The IRSSA is a very special contract with significant historical and political overtones. Fundamentally, it must be a contract that enhances the trust between the parties rather than detracts from it. Given the context and the very long-term nature of the relationship (past and future) encapsulated in this commercial agreement it seems clear that the <EM>Bhasin</EM> good faith organizing principle must apply to the IRSSA. Recent case law illustrates the injustice created by not applying <EM>Bhasin</EM> to the IRSSA.</P>
<P>19. In the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 225</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Grouard</EM></BOLD>), the Court considered whether <EM>Bhasin</EM> should apply to the IRSSA. The issue in that case was whether the Grouard Indian Residential School ceased to be an IRS from December 1957 until 1961, as was unilaterally interpreted by Canada four years into the implementation of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>20. Madam Justice Nation discussed this issue as in paragraphs 74&ndash;80 of her judgement noting that Canada's performance of the contract was arbitrary, but nonetheless refusing to apply the very principle that this court established to avoid injustice resulting from arbitrary performance:
<QUOTE><P>[74] It is difficult to render this decision, without a statement regarding the conduct of Canada. It is unusual to have a party to a contract come to court and take the position that for an undisclosed reason, after four years of implementation, the &ldquo;light bulb&rdquo; went on, and it realized it was interpreting a contract incorrectly. It is also most unusual that after that realization, the party continues to make some payments which it realizes that it is not legally required to make but insist on the strict contractual terms in relation to other payments.</P>
<P>[75] Here, in 2010, Canada determined that it should not be making payments related to the Grouard school after 1957, as it was not an IRS. Having come to that realization, it made a conscious decision to continue to make CEPs to former students of Grouard through the 1961-1962 year, even though Grouard would not technically fit under the definition of an IRS after 1957. In addition, some IAP claims post 1957 for Grouard have been adjudicated and paid, as Canada did not argue before 2010 that Grouard (post 1957) was not an IRS.</P>
<P>[76] Thus, by virtue of Canada's decision, some claimants could receive a CEP in a year on the basis they were in attendance at an IRS, but they will be denied an IAP for abuse that happened during those same years, on the basis the school was not an IRS. In addition, of two students who were abused under the definition of the IAP in the same year at the same school, one may receive an IAP and one be denied, solely because the hearing of one was before the 2010 change of position by Canada.</P>
<P>[77] In law, equity is used to review a decision that seems unfair but does not fall under a strict legal principle. Equity does have limits on its operation. Here, the only equitable principle that was argued was estoppel, which I have found is not applicable.</P>
<P>[78] One struggles to make sense of this unfortunate reality for those who receive very different treatment under this settlement regime for serious assaults on their person, due to the 2010 change of policy. Claimant's counsel touched on legal principles which a legal mind might consider to help such claimants, such as the honour of the crown argument as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Delgamuukw v British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF> or <CASEREF><SOC>Haida Nation v British Columbia (Ministry of Forests)</SOC></CASEREF>, or recent comment by the SCC regarding the duty of good faith in contracts as set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Bhasin v Hrynew</SOC></CASEREF>. Neither of these is applicable here. Canada argues that what occurred was some individuals received what might be termed a windfall, something to which they were not entitled.</P>
<P>[79] In 2010, when Canada realized it had been mistaken about is interpretation of the agreement, it made a policy decision as to how to handle its continued conduct. That policy decision is not something with which this court c an intervene. If it is assailable, it is in the court of public opinion and the political arena.</P>
<P>[80] In closing, I would observe that Canada's conduct (described in paras 74 to 76) has the effect that some Claimants suffering harm at a similar time and location have received entirely different outcomes to their claims. Observers could rightly note that Canada's conduct appears arbitrary. This is unfortunate when one considers the aim for truth, reconciliation and assistance for historical wrongs that many have strived for in an attempt to right the mistreatment that occurred as a result of historical government policy.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. It is worth noting that the application of the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principle of good faith was simply dismissed, seemingly on the premise that Canada's interpretation of the IRSSA was a policy decision, but as has been illustrated in these submissions, the IRSSA is a contract which this court has told us is subject to good faith interpretation. This error appears to be the foundation for the acknowledgement of arbitrary performance, while concurrently refusing to apply the law to remedy arbitrary performance. Justice Nation acknowledged that Canada's interpretation of its contractual obligations was arbitrary: one of the duties which the or ganizing principle of good faith expressly disavows. The application of the organizing principle of good faith and the duties to act honestly, reasonably, and not act arbitrarily or capriciously were clearly tools that Justice Nation had available to addre ss Canada's arbitrary misconduct in its interpretation and implementation of this commercial contract.</P>
<P>22. It is unfortunate that the Court incorrectly chose not to use these tools, and in doing so created an unjust result. This outcome in <EM>Grouard</EM> was unprincipled (it ignores the commercial nature of the IRSSA which has been firmly established), unfair (it runs contrary to the organizing principle of good faith and the ensuing duties to act honesty, reasonably and not capriciously or arbitrarily when interpreting performance obligations) and defeats the parties' reasonable commercial expectations and thus the certainty associated with the contract. Perhaps most importantly, this outcome erodes the trust between the parties, which is so critical to a ffect the intended result of this long-term, relationship based contract.</P>
<P>23. In a more recent decision from the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice in <CASEREF><SOC>Kwandibens v. Whitesand First Nation</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 2318</CITE></CASEREF>, (<BOLD><EM>Kwandibens</EM></BOLD>) the Court was asked to consider whether the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principle would apply to a contract between a first nation and its member in relation to housing issues. Here we see a more just result ensues with the proper application of the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principle to contractual relationship of intimate proximity (much like the one in this case). At paragraph 97 the Court says:
<QUOTE><P>[97] In considering the contractual relationship of the parties, I am mindful of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Bhasin v. Hrynew</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 71</CITE></CASEREF>. This decision discussed basic organizational principles of contractual interpretation that are applicable to commercial contracts in Canada. In particular I noted the organizing principle set out in <EM>Bhasin</EM>, that parties generally must perform their contractual duties honestly and reasonably and not capriciously or arbitrarily (<EM>Bhasin</EM>, para. 63). In my view, the relationship created in this case is closer or more intimate than the usual commercial situation being considered in <EM>Bhasin</EM>. Therefore, I see this organizing principle as applicable in this matter because of the closeness of the relationship. If it applies to commercial parties clearly it should apply in the matter where a First Nation has entered into a housing agreement with one of its members where it has a duty to house them.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. In <EM>Kwandibens</EM>, the Court correctly noted that <EM>Bhasin</EM> should apply given the context and the &ldquo;closeness of the relationship&rdquo;. Had Madam Justice Nation properly characterized the IRSSA as a contract (as opposed to a government policy) in the <EM>Grouard</EM> case, then she would not have given Canada a free pass for its violation of the duty to act honestly, reasonably and not arbitrarily or capriciously when interpreting and performing the IRSSA.</P>
<P>25. This organizing principle of good faith modernizes and gives effect to contracting parties' intentions by recognizing the importance of context in commercial relationships. It levels the playing field by giving judges another important tool in determining the parties' reasonable expectations and thus enhances certainty and trust between contracting parties.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>Application to this Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. In the context of the IRSSA (and any long term contract), there have been, and are bound to be, unforeseen issues that give rise to multiple legal interpretations and thus different performance obligations. These interpretations of performance obligations could fall within a range of reasonable interpretations, but one may lead to good faith performance consistent with the intentions of the parties, while the other may lead to just the opposite.</P>
<P>27. It is respectfully submitted that, when legal disputes arises in the context of an IRSSA obligation, (as here, where one interpretation would result in the application of a civil standard of proof and one would result in the criminal standard), the courts should be relying on the context of the contract, and the intimate relationship between the contracting parties, and im pute a duty of honourable Crown interpretation to reflect what was clearly the intentions of the parties entering an agreement to forgo other civil remedies. In this context, there is little doubt that the parties intended the civil standard, given that the parties were contracting to forgo the right to litigate civilly. Thus, this proposed context specific duty would create a just result consistent with the organizing principle of good faith and the intentions of the contracting parties.</P>
<P>28. <EM>Bhasin</EM> principles should apply to the IRSSA where there are multiple possible legal interpretations of performance obligations. It is these situations where the good faith organizing principle and the specific duties which the context requires will lead to a good faith conclusion, consistent with the intentions of the contracting parties.</P>
<P>29. The existence of the Honour of the Crown between Indigenous Canadians and Canada has long been recognized by this court. Given that the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principle creates duties according to the context and historic relationship between the parties, the creation of a duty of honourable Crown interpretation seems like the next incremental step forward in the common law, needed to promote good faith dealings between Canada and Indig enous Canadians, and the ultimate goal of reconciliation.</P>
<P>30. As the court noted in <EM>Fontaine:</EM>
<QUOTE><P>[88] The IRSSA is not a treaty between Canada and its Aboriginal peoples, but it is at least as important as a treaty.</P>
<P>[89] During argument, Canada submitted that the honour of the Crown had nothing to do with the negotiation and interpretation of the IRSSA. I agree that the honour of the Crown is not an operative principle in the IRSSA, but I disagree that it is not an interpretative principle for an agreement in which Canada makes an attempt to make peace with its Aboriginal peoples.</P>
<P>[90] If an honourable interpretation and a dishonourable interpretation are both available, obviously it would be wrong to interpret the IRSSA in a way that does dishonor to Canada. As an interpretative principle, the honour of the Crown would also apply as an interpretative principle to the other signatories of the IRSSA, who can be taken to have intended an honourable interpretation over a dishonourable one.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. This Court now has an opportunity to signal to Indigenous Canadians and Canada that, when they enter into commercial contracts to redefine a long standing historical relationship and look forward to building a new relationship based on trust, respect and reconciliation, the Courts will be available to ensure that this good faith organizing principle will protect the parties' reasonable expectations in the context of their agreement. This will be achieved by applying the good faith organizing principle and the ensuing duties which the context and the relationship between the contracting parties demand.</P>
<P>32. Such an incremental step would not undermine certainty achieved in a contract but enhance it. With this principle clearly articulated, and the list of available duties growing as different contexts demand, contracting parties will become less inclined to try and do an &lsquo;end run&rsquo; around their intended legal obligations, thus fostering good faith and trust between the parties. Trust, of course, is the &lsquo;magic ingredient&rsquo; required to move forward in a pluralistic and vibrant society where historical grievances can be meaningfully addressed in the spirit of good faith.</P>
<P>33. The unfortunate and flawed conclusions of Madame Justice Nation in <EM>Grouard</EM> and the conclusions of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in this case demonstrate the injustice created by not applying the <EM>Bhasin</EM> principles to the IRSSA. The context surrounding the IRSSA and relationship between the contracting parties demands that the <EM>Bhasin</EM> organizing principle of good faith apply to this case. Following that organizing principle, this case demands the imputation of the recognized duties of honest, reasonable, and non-arbitrary or capricious interpretation and performance obligations. This case also represents a fitting opportunity to establish the next incrementally established duty in the context of the IRSSA: honourable Crown interpretation. The signing of the IRSSA cannot be allowed to mark the end of good faith, but rather it must mark the promise of a new beginning based on continuing good faith, because without good faith, there is no trust, and without trust there can be no real reconciliation.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

Raising the Courts benefits the administration of justice and it is in the public intervention has raised important issues relating to the implementation of the IRSSA played a helpful role in the analysis of those issues.

<BLOCK0><TI>MEMORANDUM OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I: STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Public Importance</TI>
<P>1. This appeal is about the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRRSA&rdquo;) and, more specifically, the Independent Assessment Process (&ldquo;IAP&rdquo;) that was created pursuant to the IRRSA to compensate residential school survivors who were victims of sexual or physical abuse.</P>
<P>2. The implementation of the IRSSA is an issue of public importance in itself, and as part of the process of national reconciliation. Recent superior court and appeals court decisions have narrowed the scope of the courts' supervisory jurisdiction over the implementation of the IRSSA. The within leave application by a residential school survivor demonstrates the public importance of a consistent determination of the scope of court supervision of the IRSSA, in accordance with the superior court orders that approved the settlement.</P>
<P>3. This appeal also raises an issue of law that is of public importance. As they have narrowed the scope of judicial supervision, the courts have reasoned that the decisions of an administrative tribunal created by the settlement of a class action lawsuit are not subject to judicial review, even when the superior court orders approving the settlement explicitly provide for ongoing court supervision. The implementation of the IRSSA demonstrates the importance of clarifying the law of judicial review as it relates to administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>History</TI>
<P>4. As a child, the applicant, J.W., attended an Indian Residential School. While at residential school, a nun grabbed J.W.'s penis while he was in line for the shower. J.W. reacted with embarrassment, as well as anger. He pushed the nun's hand away. When he did this, she reacted with violence, hurting J.W. by grabbing and twisting his ear.</P>
<P>5. J.W. made claim in the IAP. J.W. claimed that the actions of the nun constituted compensable abuse under the Compensation Rules of the IAP, which Rules are found in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, being part of the IRRSA. At p. 3 of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, the Compensation Rules provide that:
<QUOTE><P>Any touching... by an adult employee... which exceeds recognized parental contact and violates the sexual integrity of the student</P></QUOTE>
is compensable in the IAP. (This category of compensable sexual abuse has been referred to as &ldquo;SL1.4&rdquo; in this case.)</P>
<P>6. J.W.'s claim in the IAP was heard on May 26, 2014. The Hearing Adjudicator rendered her decision denying J.W.'s claim decision on April 7, 2015. She concluded that J.W. was a credible witness and that the incident with the nun happened as J.W. described. Nevertheless, the Hearing Adjudicator decided that the incident did not constitute compensable sexual abuse because she was not satisfied the nun's act had a sexual purpose. The adjudicator construed the sexual purpose of the perpetrator as a technical requirement for establishing sexual assault in the IAP.</P>
<P>7. As provided in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, J.W. requested that another adjudicator review the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator. On the review, J.W. argued that, by requiring him to establish that his abuser had a sexual purpose, the Hearing Adjudicator misapplied the clear language of the Compensation Rules of IAP model, specifically, SL1.4 of the Compensation Rules.</P>
<P>8. In his decision, dated July 5, 2015, the Review Adjudicator confirmed the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator and denied that the Hearing Adjudicator had misapplied the IAP model. The Review Adjudicator did not take issue with the Hearing Adjudicator's requirement that J.W. is required to establish sexual purpose.</P>
<P>9. As provided in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, J.W. requested that another adjudicator review the decision of the Review Adjudicator, arguing that the Review Adjudicator failed to apply the IAP Model by failing to correct the misapplication of the IAP Model made by the Hearing Adjudicator.</P>
<P>10. In her decision, dated November 22, 2015, the Re-Review Adjudicator affirmed the decision of the Review Adjudicator and denied he had misapplied the IAP model. The Re-Review Adjudicator concluded that the Reviewing Adjudicator was not mistaken in finding that the sexual motivation of the perpetrator was an essential consideration.</P>
<P>11. Pursuant to the provisions of the IRSSA, J.W. made a Request for Direction (&ldquo;RFD&rdquo;) to the judge appointed as Supervising Judge for the IRSSA in Manitoba. J.W. argued that, by failing to correct the misapplication of the IAP Model by the Review Adjudicator, the Re-Review Adjudicator had herself misapplied the IAP Model.</P>
<P>12. The Supervising Judge delivered his decision, dated August 3, 2016, declaring that the Re-Review Adjudicator had failed to implement the IRRSA by failing to correct the Hearing Adjudicator's decision that SL1.4 claims could only be compensable if the claimant proved that the perpetrator had a sexual purpose and, further, ordering that J. W.'s claim be sent back to a first-level adjudicator to reconsider J.W.'s claim.</P>
<P>13. Canada appealed the decision of the Supervising Judge to the Manitoba Court of Appeal on the grounds that, firstly, the Supervising Judge exceeded his jurisdiction and, secondly, that the Supervising Judge misinterpreted the terms of IRRSA, including the Compensation Rules of the IAP, thereby improperly amending the IRRSA.</P>
<P>14. On May 30, 2017 the Manitoba Court of Appeal (&ldquo;MCA&rdquo;) delivered its decision, granting Canada's appeal and reinstating the decision of the Re-reviewer denying J.W.'s claim, with the result that J.W.'s application for compensation in the IAP is dismissed.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>The Attorney General of Canada v JW and Reo Law Corporation et al</SOC><CITE>2017 MBCA 54</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;MCA Decision&rdquo;]</P1></P>
<P>15. In the MCA Decision, the MCA reasoned as follows, at para. 72:
<QUOTE><P>In my view, his [the Supervising Judge's] jurisdiction was limited to determining whether the adjudicator implemented the provisions of the IAP in the narrow sense of determining whether she considered the correct terms. Once it was determined that she considered the correct terms, being category SL1.4, his jurisdiction ended and he should have dismissed the RFD. Instead, he considered whether she erred by not properly interpreting that category, which was outside his jurisdiction.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. The narrow supervisory jurisdiction articulated by the MCA is based, in part, upon its further reasoning that the supervising courts cannot conduct a judicial review of the decisions of the adjudicators in the IAP. The notion that there is no judicial review of adjudicators' decisions appears to have entered the jurisprudence in 2012, when a decision of the Supervising Judge of Ontario was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 47</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Schachter</EM>&rdquo;). The Ontario Court of Appeal commented, at para. 30:
<QUOTE><P>The Administrative Judge rejected the suggestion that judicial review of the decision of the Chief Adjudicator is available. He explained... that the Chief Adjudicator acts pursuant to the terms of the implementation orders issued by the court and, therefore, cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision that is subject to judicial review.</P></QUOTE>
<EM>Schachter</EM> involved an RFD made by a lawyer seeking review of an adjudicator's decision respecting the quantum of his legal fees.</P>
<P>17. Before the Supervising Judge, J.W. had argued that the Hearing Adjudicator had denied compensation to J.W based, firstly, upon an interpretation of the Compensation Rules, specifically SL1.4, that is completely unsupportable in the plain language of SL1.4 and, secondly, upon a stark misapplication of the jurisprudence on sexual assault, specifically <CASEREF><SOC>R. v Chase</SOC><CITE>[1987] 2 SCR 293</CITE></CASEREF>. The consequence of the MCA decision is that, no matter how badly an adjudicator in the IAP misinterprets the Compensation Rules, there is no court supervision available to the IAP claimant denied compensation by the misinterpretation&mdash;however egregious&mdash;as long as the adjudicator has purported to apply the applicable compensation rule.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II: STATEMENT OF THE QUESTIONS IN ISSUE</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. In light of the national importance of the IRRSA to the process of reconciliation that is now underway, the MCA Decision in this case raises four related issues of national public importance.
<P1>(i) Is judicial review of adjudicators' decisions in the IAP available to claimants who have been denied compensation and, if so, what is the applicable standard of review?</P1>
<P1>(ii) Is there any general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review of administrative tribunals that are formed pursuant to the terms of a settlement in a class proceeding?</P1>
<P1>(iii) In the event that no judicial review of IAP decisions is available, and judicial supervision of IAP decisions is restricted to the basis set out in <EM>Schachter</EM>, is there &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; for a claimant who was denied compensation based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA?</P1>
<P1>(iv) Was the MCA correct when it held that claimants whose IAP claims are denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRRSA have no recourse to the courts supervising the implementation, enforcement and administration of the IRSSA?</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>PART III: STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Judicial Review of IAP Decisions</TI>
<P>19. There are two major, and inter-related grounds that support the view that judicial review of the administrative tribunals in the IAP is available. The first ground is <EM>The Class Proceedings Act</EM>, C.C.S.M. c. C130 of Manitoba (&ldquo;CPA&rdquo;). (There are similar provisions in the class proceeding statutes of other provinces.) Section 12 of the CPA provides as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>12.</N><SECP>The court may at any time make any order that it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of a class proceeding to ensure its fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose on one or more of the parties the terms it considers appropriate.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>
This section grants robust jurisdiction to the courts to ensure the fairness of the determination of a class proceeding &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;.</P>
<P>20. Furthermore, section 35 of the CPA provides as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>35.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>A class proceeding may be settled, discontinued or abandoned only
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>with the approval of the court; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>on the terms the court considers appropriate.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>A settlement may be concluded in relation to the common issues affecting a subclass only
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>with the approval of the court; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>on the terms the court considers appropriate.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. Secondly, the superior courts of the provinces which approved the settlement of the class action brought by residential school survivors set out the terms upon which the IRRSA was approved in judgments that incorporated identical approval Orders, including the following terms:
<QUOTE><P>12. THIS COURT ORDERS that the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and which is expressly incorporated by reference into this judgment, including the definitions included therein, is hereby approved and shall be implemented, in accordance with this judgment and any further order of this Court.</P>
<P>13. THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that this Court shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment.</P>
<P>31. THIS COURTS DECLARES that the Representative Plaintiffs, Defendants, Released Church Organizations, Class Counsel, the National Administration Committee, or the Trustee, or such other person or entity as this Court may allow, after fully exhausting the dispute resolution mechanisms contemplated in the Agreement, may apply to the Court for directions in respect of the implementation, administration or amendment of the Agreement or the implementation of this judgment on notice to all affected parties, all in conformity with the terms of the Agreement.</P>
<P>36. THIS COURT DECLARES that the provisions of the applicable class proceedings law shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of the Agreement and this judgment.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Schulman, pronounced the 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of December, 2006.</P1></P>
<P>22. Per paragraph 36 of the approval Order of Justice Schulman, quoted immediately above, the provisions of the CPA &ldquo;shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of this Agreement [IRRSA].&rdquo; Recall that s. 12 of the CPA provides that &ldquo;the court may at any time make any order that it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of a class proceeding to ensure its fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose on one or more of the parties the terms it considers appropriate.&rdquo; Paragraph 36 of the approval Order makes s. 12 of the CPA applicable to the implementation of the IRRSA. The approval Order therefore orders that the Supervising Judge in Manitoba may make orders to ensure that the IAP is operated and implemented fairly</P>
<P>23. The supervising courts in the provinces have commented on the role of the courts. In the Ontario Superior Court decision approving the IRSSA, <CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2006] O.J. No. 4968</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>83 OR (3d) 481</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [&ldquo;<EM>Baxter</EM>&rdquo;], at para. 12, Justice Winkler reasoned:
<QUOTE><P>The court has an obligation under the <EM>Class Proceedings Act</EM>, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (&ldquo;CPA&rdquo;) to protect the interests of the absent class members, both in determining whether the settlement meets the test for approval and in ensuring that the administration and implementation of the settlement are done in a manner that delivers the promised benefits to the class members. In seeking the approval of the court, the plaintiffs and defendants essentially seek the benefits of having the court sanction the settlement. Such approval cannot be divorced from the obligation it entails. Once the court is engaged, it cannot abdicate its responsibilities under the CPA.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. In a later decision of the Supervising Judge of British Colombia, in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Justice Brown articulated the responsibility of the supervising courts in language that echoes <EM>Baxter</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>The court supervision aims to ensure that legitimate claims are compensated to the full extent available under the settlement terms and that the process by which those claims are adjudicated has the integrity, impartiality and transparency expected of any other court process.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. On these delineations of the judicial supervision function of the supervising courts, not only is judicial supervision of the courts available to claimants who have been denied delivery of the benefits promised in the IRRSA, the courts are &ldquo;obligated&rdquo; to supervise the settlement to ensure that such delivery is made.</P>
<P>26. The applicant is unaware of any authority, any rule of law that prevents the judicial review of decisions of administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions pursuant to the CPA, or the class proceedings statutes of other provinces. However, such a rule against judicial review seems to have been introduced into the judicial supervision of the IRRSA by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Schachter</EM>. There seems to be no other authority for such a rule of law. The applicant's position is that <EM>Schachter</EM> restricts court supervision in a manner that is untenable in view of the provincial class proceedings statutes; the court orders approving the IRRSA; and the reasons of court decisions approving the IRRSA, as cited above.</P>
<P>27. The administrative tribunal of the IAP is a creation of the IRSSA. The Compensation Rules by which adjudicators in the IAP are bound form part of the IRRSA. Based upon the Manitoba CPA, the Orders of Justice Schulman approving the IRRSA, and the non-existence of any rule of law preventing the judicial review of the decisions administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions, it is manifest that the Court of Queen's Ben ch in Manitoba has the jurisdiction and responsibility to review decisions of the IAP.</P>
<P>28. The modem test for the determination for the standard of review is in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>], paras. 52&ndash;58. The applicant's position is that the court orders approving and implementing the IRRSA should be considered as related to the adjudication of the IAP in a manner analogous to the relation of statutory regimes to other administrative tribunals. There is no privative clause in court Orders approving the IRRSA&mdash;quite the opposite: As we have seen, the Orders imply ongoing, robust supervision of the IRRSA to ensure that promised benefits are delivered to class members.</P>
<P>29. Regarding the remaining <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> factors&mdash;purpose of the decision maker, nature of the question and expertise of the tribunal&mdash;the administrative tribunal created by the IRRSA is a specialized one with its own rules for the determination of claims by adjudicators. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; (at p. 14) provides that there are two levels of review available to the claimant within the IAP:
<QUOTE><P>i. For cases within the standard... any party may ask the Chief Adjudicator or designate to determine whether an adjudicator's, or reviewing adjudicator's, decision properly applied the IAP Model to the facts as found by the adjudicator, and if not, to correct the decision, and the Chief Adjudicator or designate may do so.</P>
<P>ii. In both the standard and the complex issues tracks, Claimants may require that a second adjudicator review a decision to determine whether it contains a palpable and overriding error.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. The formation of a specialized tribunal and the availability, within the IAP, of one level of review in cases where palpable and overriding errors are alleged, and two levels of review (for claimants) where the proper application of the IAP Model is at issue tends to support some level of deference to Re-review decisions in the IAP.</P>
<P>31. However, at issue here is not primarily whether some level of deference should be accorded to the Re-review Adjudicator. At issue is what support exists in statute, in the court decisions approving the IRRSA, in the IRRSA itself, or in the common law for th e rule against judicial review in the IAP introduced in <EM>Schachter</EM> and adopted by the MCA in this case. The applicant's view is that, in fact, the sources of law referred to above, in conjunction with the <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> factors supports the availability of judicial review of IAP decisions on a standard of reasonableness.</P>
<P>32. In the MCA Decision, the MCA adopted the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule against judicial review in the IAP; therefore, it did not address the question whether the decision of the Re-review adjudicator in J.W.'s case was reasonable.</P>
<P>33. The Supervising Judge had ruled that the decision of the Hearing Adjudicator in J.W.'s case was based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the Compensation Rules that form part of the IRRSA and further, that the Re-review adjudicator had failed to correct this unreasonable interpretation (Edmond Decision, paras. 42 to 58).</P>
<P>34. The Supervising Judge found that the adjudicators' interpretation of SL 1.4 was inconsistent with its plain language (Edmond Decision, paras. 44 to 48). He also concluded that the adjudicators applied <EM>Chase</EM> to require a &ldquo;sexual purpose&rdquo; on the part of the alleged abuser; whereas, <EM>Chase</EM> actually provides the opposite: That the sexual purpose of the abuser is only one factor to be considered, and not a re quirement (Edmond Decision, paras. 49 to 53).</P>
<P>35. However, the Supervising Judge did not purport to make his decision based upon an application of the usual reasonableness standard in a judicial review, as articulated in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>. Rather, the Supervising Judge reasoned that he was following <EM>Schachter</EM>.</P>
<P>36. <EM>Schachter</EM> set down a rule against judicial review of adjudicators in the IAP:
<QUOTE><P>Judicial review is not available to review the exercise of authority by a judicially created body, which has been given certain duties as provided by the terms of the S.A.[IRRSA] and the implementation orders.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Schachter</EM>, para. 52.</P1></P>
<P>37. <EM>Schachter</EM> was followed in 2014 by the then Supervising Judge for Manitoba, in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Residents Decision&rdquo;]. However, the application of <EM>Schachter</EM> did not prevent the then Supervising Judge from making a determination about the correct standard of review, which he determined to be reasonableness.
<P1>Residents Decision, paras. 50&ndash;56.</P1></P>
<P>38. Similarly, the successor Supervising Judge in Manitoba in this case made a determination about the standard of review, concluding as follows:
<QUOTE><P>I find that my jurisdiction in reviewing the essential decisions of IAP adjudicators is confined to ensuring that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case... Put another way, on the facts of this particular case, the Adjudicator herself found that the only reason J.W.'s claim was not compensable was because it was a &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP that J.W. had to prove that the nun had grabbed his penis for a sexual purpose. If her interpretation of this &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP is not legally tenable, then in my view, it is not reasonable for the Chief Adjudicator to fail to correct that error so as to ensure that the IRSSA has been properly implemented.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Edmond Decision, paras. 40-41</P1></P>
<P>39. While <EM>Schachter</EM> has come to stand for the proposition that there is no judicial review of the decisions of adjudicators in the IAP, <EM>Schachter</EM> itself does not rule out the determination of a standard of review. And, as explained above, in two Manitoba cases following <EM>Schachter</EM> it has been determined, in the first case, that reasonableness and, in the second case, a variation on reasonableness were the appropriate standards of review.</P>
<P>40. The MCA Decision in this case, however, decided that the standard in the Edmond Decision was ultimately indistinguishable from the usual reasonableness standard. The MCA rejects both judicial review of IAP decisions and the language of &ldquo;standard of review&rdquo; in favour of its own articulation of very narrow grounds of &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo;, whereby a Supervising Judge's jurisdiction is restricted to determining whether the IAP adjudicators considered &ldquo;the correct terms&rdquo;.</P>
<P>41. The MCA further rejects the reasoning of the Residents Decision of the previous Supervising Judge for Manitoba (MCA Decision, paras. 65&ndash;68), which, like the Edmond Decision, had overturned an IAP decision deemed to be the result of an unreasonable interpretation of the Compensation Rules.</P>
<P>42. The following is a timeline summarizing the narrowing of judicial supervision of the administrative tribunals of the IAP in recent court decisions:

</TABLE></P>
<P>43. The MCA Decision cites favourably the following statement of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Schachter</EM>, at para 52: &ldquo;Recourse to the courts is only available if it is provided for in the S.A. [IRRSA] or the implementation orders.&rdquo; <EM>Schachter</EM> goes on to analyze the language of the IRRSA and the court Orders to define a scope for judicial recourse that purports to be particular to the IAP. In the MCA Decision, the MCA interprets the <EM>Schachter</EM> analysis as ruling out review of IAP decisions on a reasonableness standard.</P>
<P>44. The applicant's position is that the clauses of the approval Orders quoted above (see paragraph 22) set out the <UNDER>grounds</UNDER> for judicial review, but do not even purport to set a standard of review; see <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 12</CITE><PARANUM>51</PARANUM></CASEREF>. And the grounds for review articulated in the approval Orders are robust enough to be consistent with a <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> analysis which yields reasonableness as the standard of review. The project of defining a mode of &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; that is unique to the IAP, and establishing a standard of &ldquo;recourse&rdquo; that is more restrictive, or deferential than the reasonableness standard was misguided.</P>
<P>45. It is also noteworthy that <EM>Schachter</EM> is distinguishable from this case on the facts. <EM>Schachter</EM> was an RFD whereby a lawyer sought to overturn the decision of an adjudicator respecting the lawyer's legal fees, rather than an RFD whereby a residential school survivor sought a remedy for the unreasonable denial of compensation in his IAP claim.</P>
<P>46. For the reasons articulated above, it is the applicant's view that it was a mistake to introduce a rule against judicial review in the IAP. None of the reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM>, or in MCA Decision establishes that the parties to the IRRSA, or the superior courts that approved the IRSSA intended to insulate decisions made by adjudicators in the IAP from the generally available judicial review of administrative tribunals. Moreover, the language of the orders approving the IRRSA indicates the contrary.</P>
<P>47. However, if the applicant is mistaken in holding that decisions of administrative tribunals in the IAP are subject to judicial review, then the applicant nevertheless holds that the MCA Decision granting Canada's appeal, with its result that J.W.'s IAP claim is dismissed, should be set aside on the grounds that it misapplies the <EM>Schachter</EM> test for judicial recourse in the IAP.</P>
<P>48. As we have seen, <EM>Schachter</EM> allows for judicial recourse in cases where the Re-review adjudicator's decision reflects a failure to comply with the terms of the IRRSA or the court orders. However, the MCA Decision erroneously construes a failure to <UNDER>comply</UNDER> with the terms of the IRRSA as a failure to <UNDER>apply</UNDER> the terms of the IRRSA, in the narrow sense of failing &ldquo;to consider the correct terms&rdquo;. The applicant's position is that, if the adjudicator has interpreted the Compensation Rules of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;&mdash;which form part of the IRRSA&mdash;in a manner which completely subverts the plain language of those Rules, the he or she has not <UNDER>complied</UNDER> with the IRRSA in a meaningful sense.</P>
<P>49. According to the MCA Decision, even the most untenable interpretation of the Compensation Rules by an IAP adjudicator can be said to &ldquo;comply&rdquo; with the IRRSA, and be insulated from judicial supervision, provided only that the adjudicator has purported to apply, or &ldquo;consider&rdquo; the applicable compensation rule. The applicant's position is that this is, at best, a sort of empty, formalistic sense of &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; that is not supported in the language of the approval Orders&mdash;and certainly not supported by a purposive interpretation of the approval Orders.</P>
<P>50. As we have seen, the approval Orders order that &ldquo;this Court shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment&rdquo;. This language requires the superior courts to supervise the implementation of the IRRSA for <UNDER>meaningful</UNDER> compliance.</P>
<P>51. And where the issue is the meaningful compliance of adjudicators with the provisions of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, in particular the adjudicators' compliance with the Compensation Rules of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, an evaluation of reasonableness of the adjudicators' interpretation of the Compensation Rules will be inescapable.</P>
<P>52. However, if the applicant is mistaken that court supervision is supervision for meaningful compliance, then the applicant submits that the MCA Decision is still mistaken in holding that the adjudicators applied the correct provisions of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; in adjudicating J.W.'s IAP claim.</P>
<P>53. At page 7 of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, the IRRSA provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Standards for compensable wrongs and for the assessment of compensation have been defined for this IAP. The adjudicator is bound by those standards.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, p. 7</P1></P>
<P>54. In his submissions to the Supervising Judge, J.W. argued that the adjudicators had failed to give effect to the clause of the compensation rule in SL1.4 that refers to touching &ldquo;which exceeds recognized parental contact&rdquo;. The Supervising Judge took up this submission (see Edmond Decision, para. 45) when he reasoned that the adjudicators' interpretation of SL1.4 in J.W.'s claim implied that there could be sexual touching of a child that is within the bounds of recognized parental contact. But that implication, as the Supervising Judge notes, is clearly absurd.</P>
<P>55. It is not consistent with the IRRSA's rule that adjudicators must be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by its standards for compensable wrongs to subvert those standards via an absurd interpretation of them. It follows that, by failing to be bound by the standards for compensable wrongs, as required by Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, the adjudicators in J.W.'s case failed to apply an applicable provision of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the IRRSA.</P>
<P>56. While the applicant submits that the Re-review Adjudicator's decision in J.W.'s claim should be overturned even pursuant to the very narrow &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; articulated in the MCA Decision, the more significant result of the foregoing analysis is that the reasonableness standard is inescapable. Even judicial supervision that would purport only to determine whether an adjudicator has considered the correct terms of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; runs into the requirement of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; itself that adjudicators are &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by the Compensation Rules.</P>
<P>57. To be bound by rules is not to make an empty gesture of applying them, or to apply them in an irrational, or absurd way. To be bound by rules means to follow them in a reasonable fashion. Consequently, even pursuant to the MCA Decision, the Supervising Judges have the jurisdiction to determine whether a claimant was denied compensation by an interpretation that is inconsistent with the adjudicator's obligation under the IRRSA to be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by the rules&mdash;that is, to follow the rules reasonably.</P>
<P>58. The applicant submits that reasonableness is inescapable in a larger sense, inasmuch as any determination of whether a correct rule has been considered will require an analysis of the meaning of the rule in order to determine whether it was the rule that was considered, or some absurd interpretation in the guise of the rule.</P>
<P>59. Finally, in both <EM>Schachter</EM> and the MCA Decision, it is reasoned that the IRRSA was intended to be an expeditious process. This is offered as a reason to reject the reasonableness standard of review, and to reject judicial review of IAP decisions <EM>per se</EM>. However, there is no provision of the IRSSA, or the approval Orders which signifies that the speedy disposition of claims is so important that the courts ordered to supervise the IAP mu st refrain from overturning unreasonable interpretations of the Compensation Rules by which compensation claims are denied.</P>
<P>60. There is no support in the IRRSA or the approval Orders for the view that a speedy disposition of claims is more important than the adjudication of the claims in accordance with the Compensation Rules that the survivors bargained for.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The proposed appeal concerns a fact-driven inquiry regarding the proper interpretation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRSSA&rdquo;). At issue is the Independent Assessment Process (&ldquo;IAP&rdquo;), a post-litigation claims assessment process created and negotiated by the parties to the IRSSA to provide eligible claimants with the opportunity to receive compensation for Indian Residential School abuse.</P>
<P>2. Following a consistent line of jurisprudence, the Manitoba Court of Appeal (the &ldquo;MBCA&rdquo;) applied a <EM>sui generis</EM> approach, referred to in jurisprudence nationwide as the &ldquo;<EM>Schachter</EM> threshold&rdquo;, to determine whether it could intervene in the IAP claim of Applicant J.W. The MBCA correctly held that judicial recourse is available on an IAP claim only in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; where a decision of the Chief Adjudicator or his designate reflects &ldquo;a failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders [...].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Attorney General of Canada v JW and Reo Law Corporation et al</SOC><CITE>2017 MBCA 54</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>MBCA Decision</EM>] at para 36; Application for Leave to Appeal of the Applicants, J.W. and REO Law Corporation, dated August 28, 2017 [REO Application Record], Tab 4 at 61-62.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. The Applicants challenge the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, ignoring the strong rationale behind it, and suggest replacing it entirely with the doctrine of judicial review. If allowed, the proposed appeal would expand the superior courts' jurisdiction to remit or reconsider IAP compensation decisions, materially amending the IRSSA and disrupting the integrity and finality of the IAP.</P>
<P>4. There is no question of public importance here. At its heart, the proposed appeal concerns the interpretation of the IRSSA and related court orders, matters which have been addressed consistently by co urts throughout Canada. The parties considered the IAP to be a post-litigation process, from which no appeal or judicial review was available.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>111 OR (3d) 461</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Schachter ONCA</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the interests of finality, they did not include a right of court access following the conclusion of an IAP claim.</P>
<P>5. The application for leave to appeal must be dismissed.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Statement of Facts</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. The substantive factual background relates primarily to the history of the IRSSA and the contents of the IAP Model. Given the courts' long-standing role supervising the implementation and administration of the IRSSA, many pertinent factual details are sourced to jurisprudence and court ord ers in addition to the agreement itself.</P>
<P>7. Insofar as the proposed appeal implicates the IAP claim of J.W., those facts remain largely uncontested but require some correction and supplementation as below.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>The IRSSA</TI>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Creation of the IRSSA</EM></TI>
<P>8. The IRSSA is a national class action settlement agreement seeking the &ldquo;fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, dated May 8, 2006 [IRSSA] at para B at 6. <UNDER>http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/IRS%20Settlement%20Agreement-%20ENGLISH.pdf</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The IRSSA resolved outstanding litigation related to Indian Residential Schools, and established two main compensation processes: the Common Experience Payment (CEP), which is payable to eligible former residents on the basis of years of residence;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at Article Five at 43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and, the IAP, described in further detail below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at Article Six at 50 and Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the IRSSA [IAP Model]. <UNDER>http: //www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/Schedule</UNDER> D-IAP.PDF</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The IRSSA was negotiated and designed for certainty and finality. To that end, its terms constitute the &ldquo;entire agreement&rdquo; among the parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at Article 18.06 at 83.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>The courts' role in the IRSSA</EM></TI>
<P>10. Nine superior courts across Canada approved the IRSSA as a class action settlement, resolving the underlying litigation. In granting their approvals, the courts were required to satisfy themselves that the IRSSA was &ldquo;fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the class members.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bodnar v The Cash Store Inc</SOC><CITE>2011 BCCA 384</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>341 D.L.R. (4th) 601</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. The nine approving courts continue to retain supervisory jurisdiction over the implementation and administration of the IRSSA. All nine courts issued the Court Administration Protocol (the &ldquo;Protocol&rdquo;), which sets out the terms upon which a party may file a Request for Direction to access the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts.

<P>19. These Rules compensate proven abuse, consequential harms, opportunity loss, actual income loss, aggravating factors, and future care.

<BLOCK5><TI><EM>The express role of the courts</EM></TI>
<P>23.

<P>24. Parties to the IRSSA used clear language to define when an IRSSA claim could result in a court proceeding. For CEP claims, the parties negotiated a clear appeal provision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at Article 5.09 49-50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For applications to have an institution recognized as an Indian Residential School under Article 12 of the IRSSA, the parties similarly provided a clear right of access to the courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at Article 12.01 at 62&ndash;64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In contrast, the parties provided no external right of appeal or review of IAP decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>By contrast, see the IAP claim reference provisions of the IAP Model at page 8, b.(iii).

There is, however, no general right of appeal from the IAP.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iii)</N><TI>J.W.'s Claim</TI>
<P>25. Applicant J.W. brought an IAP claim which was dismissed by adjudicators at all three levels. In short, J.W. established that while he was waiting in line to be bathed at an Indian Residential School, a nun briefly grabbed his penis from on top of his bathing gown.</P>
<P>26. J.W . alleged abuse under the &ldquo;SL1.4&rdquo; subcategory of the IAP Model:
<QUOTE><P>Any touching of a student, including touching with an object, by an adult employee or other adult lawfully on the premises which exceeds recognized parental contact and <EM>violates the sexual integrity of the student</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IAP Model, <EM>supra</EM> note 5 at 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. The main issue on J.W.'s claim was the interpretation of SL1.4. The adjudicators accepted the decision of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>R v Chase</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>R v Chase</SOC><CITE>[1987] 2 SCR 293</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>45 DLR (4th) 98</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> as providing interpretative guidance. <CASEREF><SOC>R v Chase</SOC></CASEREF> considered whether an act was committed &ldquo;in circumstances of a sexual nature, <EM>such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated</EM>,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 11 (emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and sets out an objective test consisting of the multiple factors.</P>
<P>28. The Hearing Adjudicator dismissed J.W.'s claim. She considered the evidence in light of SL1.4 and applied the contextual factors set out in <CASEREF><SOC>R v Chase</SOC></CASEREF>, but could not conclude the proven act qualified as sexual assault under the IAP Model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MBQB Decision</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 19 at para 12. REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. The Review Adjudicator upheld the dismissal, finding the Hearing Decision neither misapplied the IAP Model to the facts, nor made a palpable error.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 14. REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Re-Review Adjudicator then upheld the review, finding no fault with the application of the IAP Model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 16-17. REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 24-25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iv)</N><TI>Procedural Background</TI>
<P>30. Unsuccessful on re-review, J.W. and his legal counsel REO Law(collectively, the Applicants) jointly filed a Request for Direction under the Protocol, seeking either (i) a judicial finding of SL1.4 abuse on J.W. claim, or (ii) an adjudicative reconsideration of J.W.'s claim. The Applicants challenged the interpretative value of the <CASEREF><SOC>R v Chase</SOC></CASEREF> factors for the purposes of the SL1.4 category and disagreed with the way in which the independent adjudicators applied those factors.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Decision of the IRSSA Supervisory Judge for Manitoba</EM></TI>
<P>31. In a Direction dated August 3, 2016, the Supervisory Judge for Manitoba found the Re-Review Decision on J.W.'s IAP claim was so unreasonable as to amount to a misapplication of the IAP Model, and remitted the claim for a reconsideration by an IAP hearing adjudicator.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 57-58, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 42.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The Supervisory Judge agreed &ldquo;adjudicators are entitled to give context and interpretation to the language used in the LAP&rdquo; but decided the adjudicator &ldquo;failed in [her] task&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 56, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 42.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>:</P>
<P>33. The Supervisory Judge purported to follow the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold for judicial recourse, but in fact articulated a new and distinct legal test to justify intervening in J.W.'s IAP claim. Canada appealed on the basis that the Supervisory Judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>Decision of the MBCA</EM></TI>
<P>34. The MBCA unanimously overturned the Supervisory Judge and reinstated the Re -Review Decision on J.W.'s IAP claim.</P>
<P>35. The Honourable Madam Justice Beard, writing for the MBCA, found the Supervisory Judge had erred in two ways: (i) by expanding the court's jurisdiction to consider &ldquo;whether the adjudicators erred in their interpretation of the terms of the IAP,&rdquo; and (ii) by purporting to review an IAP decision on the basis that it is &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MBCA Decision</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 1 at para 50, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Beard JA's conclusion follows from her observation that the IAP is &ldquo;a complete code&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the adjudication process was intended to be a closed process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 47-48, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 66-67.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. Acknowledging the extensive jurisprudence on point, Beard JA highlighted the distinction between &ldquo;the failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders&rdquo; and &ldquo;the correctness/reasonableness of the interpretation or application of those terms.&rdquo; Only the former satisfies the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold and &ldquo;constitutes the very limited circumstances in which a party can have recourse to the courts.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 42, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 65.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Beard JA noted independent adjudicators are entitled to &ldquo;give context to, and to interpret the language of, the IAP&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 45, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 66.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> but concluded that &ldquo;[a]n adjudicator cannot refuse or fail to consider the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP Model, or choose to consider others, as this would constitute a failure to comply with the IRSSA and the IAP Model.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 51, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Beard JA concluded the Supervisory Judge had &ldquo;erred in focusing on the adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP rather than on whether the adjudicator considered the correct terms.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 53, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 69.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Noting the inconsistency with the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, Beard JA found that the court's jurisdiction would extend &ldquo;to many, rather than limited or exceptional, cases&rdquo; if such interpretation disputes created sufficient grounds to access the supervisory courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 54, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 69.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>40. The only question is whether the Applicants have raised an issue of public importance that would warrant this Honourable Court's consideration. No such issue is raised.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>41. The Applicants argue the MBCA should have seized jurisdiction over J.W.'s IAP claim. They suggest the supervisory courts, having a broad jurisdiction post -settlement, must treat the IAP as an administrative tribunal and hear requests for judicial review from IAP decisions, to ensure cla imants receive &ldquo;promised benefits&rdquo; (which they mischaracterize as consisting of IAP compensation.)</P>
<P>42. The Applicants ignore most of the jurisprudence on point and undermine the supervisory courts' delicately balanced articulation of their jurisdiction vis-&ag;-vis the IAP.</P>
<P>43. The decision of the MBCA below was correct in reasoning and result, and fully consistent with long-standing jurisprudence throughout Canada. In particular, the MBCA's decision is consistent with:
<P1>(a) The long-standing determination that no appeal or judicial review lies from an IAP decision; and,</P1>
<P1>(b) The well-established <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, by which courts will only grant judicial recourse in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; where a decision of the Chief Adjudicator reflects a failure to comply with the IRSSA.</P1></P>
<P>44. Therefore, this leave application raises no issue of public importance, and should be dismissed.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Appeals and Judicial Reviews Are Clearly Not Available From the IAP</UNDER></TI>
<P>45. The proposed appeal seeks to undermine the clear rule against appeals and judicial reviews established by the seminal <EM>Schachter</EM> decisions of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and the ONCA, and endorsed numerous times consistent with the agreement reached by the parties to the IRSSA. There is no legal or logical basis upon which to challenge that rule, and the proposed appeal raises no issue of public importance in this regard.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>The Rule against Appeals or Judicial Reviews in Schachter ONSC</TI>
<P>46. In <EM>Schachter ONSC</EM>, Winkler CJO, as the Eastern Administrative Judge (Ontario), dismissed a challenge by claimant counsel against an IAP adjudicator's legal fee review decision,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (AG)</SOC><JUDGDATE>7 March 2011</JUDGDATE><DOCKET>00-CV-192059CP</DOCKET><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Direction) [<EM>Schachter ONSC</EM>] at para 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and was unanimously upheld on appeal.</P>
<P>47. In dismissing the request, Winkler CJO determined there is no right to appeal or judicially review decisions arising from the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 19, 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. On the availability of appeals from the IAP, Winkler CJO noted although it is &ldquo;tempting&rdquo; to view the claims assessment process of the IAP as constituting continued litigation, it is in fact a post-litigation process from which no right of appeal exists.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He added:
<QUOTE><P>[22] Further, no right of appeal can be grounded on the supervisory jurisdiction that the courts have over the implementation of the Settlement and the Settlement Orders. In other words, <UNDER>there is no implicit right to appeal each determination made within the context of the claims administration or assessment process as an incident of the judicial oversight function</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>49. On the availability of judicial reviews from the IAP, Winkler CJO completely foreclosed the possibility, holding:
<QUOTE><P>[19] ... Judicial review may be available where a statutory power of decision has been exercised by an inferior tribunal, but a superior court does not judicially review its own order. Here, where the Chief Adjudicator is acting pursuant to a term of the orders issued by superior courts, he cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision subject to judicial review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(ii)</N><TI>Subsequent Jurisprudence Affirms the Rule Against Appeals/Judicial Reviews</TI>
<P>50. The rule against appeals and judicial reviews was upheld and has been followed in many subsequent cases involving the IRSSA.</P>
<P>51. In 2012, on appeal from Winkler CJO's decision, a unanimous panel of the ONCA issued the <EM>Schachter ONCA</EM> decision upholding Winkler CJO and confirming that no appeal or judicial review lies from an IAP decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter ONCA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 2 at paras 50, 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. Notably, the rule was recently affirmed in the <EM>Bundled RFDs #1</EM> decision (2016, BCSC)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs #1</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 14 at para 165.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the <EM>Spanish Appeal</EM> decision (2017, ONCA)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish Appeal</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 14 at para 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> before being endorsed by the MBCA in the decision below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MBCA Decision</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 1 at para 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iii)</N><TI>The Applicants' Position is Untenable</TI>
<P>53. Notwithstanding the clear rule to the contrary, the Applicants nevertheless suggest that at this late stage of the IRSSA, the doctrine of judicial review ought to be imported to govern the courts' oversight of the IAP. In support, the Applicants erroneously characterize the IAP as an &ldquo;administrative tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
<P>54. The Applicants' characterization is simply without legal or factual basis. The reasoning of Winkler CJO in <EM>Schachter ONSC</EM> provides a full answer to the Applicants' position: the IAP is not a statutory administrative tribunal, but rather a post-litigation claims assessment process established pursuant to the will of contracting parties. The framework of judicial review is simply inconsiste nt with the parties' intentions and is inapplicable to the unique IAP. The importation of this doctrine into the IAP would constitute an impermissible amendment to the IRSSA and would be contrary to the consistent, nationwide jurisprudence.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The <EM>Schachter</EM> Threshold for Judicial Recourse is Well-Settled</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The proposed appeal further seeks to uproot the standard applied by courts across Canada for determining when to intervene in an IAP claim. Again, the Applicants are simply offside the well&mdash;established jurisprudence and provide no legitimate basis for challenging the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold. They raise no issue of public importance.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>(i)</N><TI>Background: The Schachter Threshold</TI>
<P>56. In <EM>Schachter ONCA</EM>, having ruled out judicial reviews and appeals from IAP decisions, the ONCA went on to address the availability of some other &ldquo;process, other than an appeal or judicial review, [...] to review a decision by the Chief Adjudicator.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter ONCA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 2 at para 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>57. The Court acknowledged an IRSSA supervisory court may, through its supervisory jurisdiction, provide judicial recourse in respect of an IAP claim or decision, but imposed a high jurisdictional threshold (the &ldquo;<EM>Schachter</EM> threshold&rdquo;). The Court found judicial recourse from the IAP would be available on ly in &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. In particular, the Court identified the bright line <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold may be met upon a proven failure on the part of the Chief Adjudicator to &ldquo;consider,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> &ldquo;comply with,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 57 &amp; 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> &ldquo;enforce,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 66 &amp; 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and &ldquo;apply&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders.</P>
<P>59. The ONCA's clear expectation was that judicial recourse would be sparing:
<QUOTE><P>[58] ... I agree with the Chief Adjudicator's submission that allowing a party to request directions when it is alleged that the Chief Adjudicator's decision reflects a failure to apply the terms of the implementation orders raises concerns about finality, efficiency and has the potential to overburden the Administrative Judges. However, I am satisfied that these concerns are alleviated by the clear limits on when such a request is available....<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>60. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold was designed to respect &ldquo;both the importance of the finality of decisions under the [IRSSA] and the relative expertise of the Chief Adjudicator [...].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As well, it implicitly recognizes that the IAP is part of a negotiated contract, rather than a creature of statute.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(ii)</N><TI>Jurisprudence Applying the Schachter Threshold</TI>
<P>61. In seeking to disturb the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, the Applicants fail to note the considerable weight of recent and consistent jurisprudence in multiple jurisdictions, which follows and applies that threshold, including:

<P>62. The Applicants also fail to note a further line of jurisprudence which implicitly endorses the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold and which respects the IAP as a closed, post-litigation process created by contract, including:
<P1>(a) <BOLD><EM>J.C. RFD</EM></BOLD>, 2013 (QCSC):<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine c. Canada (Procureur g&ea;n&ea;ral)</SOC><CITE>2013 QCCS 553</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2013] 3 CNLR 266</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rolland J, as Supervisory Judge for Quebec, dismissed a request by an alleged perpetrator seeking to annul an IAP hearing decision on the basis that his procedural rights under the IAP had been breached.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 50&ndash;65.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rolland J reached his decision because &ldquo;the Adjudicator made his decision in accordance with the provisions of the IRSSA.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) <BOLD><EM>Grouard RFD</EM></BOLD>, 2015 (ABQB):<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 225</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2015] 4 CNLR 69</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nation J, as Supervisory Judge for Alberta, declined to assess an IAP adjudicator's decision on the years of operation of an Indian Residential School institution, noting that the IRSSA &ldquo;makes no provision for any appeal or review to this or any of the supervising courts of the decisions made in that process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>63. The MBCA's decision below is consistent with all above-referenced jurisprudence. Beard JA's reasons are informed by the view that the IAP is &ldquo;a closed and expeditious process for adjudicating the individual claims.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MBCA Decision</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 1 at para 63, REO Application Record, Tab 4 at 72.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> She expressly applied the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, and properly determined that the case before her did not present &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; in the nature of a failure by the Chief Adjudicator to apply the IRSSA.</P>
<P>64. In addition to its reliance on the <EM>Schachter</EM> decisions, the MBCA's decision below also relies on the <EM>Spanish Appeal</EM> and <EM>Bundled RFDs #1</EM> decisions. It is consistent with the overwhelming preponderance of the jurisprudence.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>(iii)</N><TI>No Reason to Disturb the <EM>Schachter</EM> Threshold</TI>
<P>65. The proposed appeal raises no issue of public importance in respect of the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold, which is a settled and well-founded legal test applied across Canada. The Applicants' challenge to the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold is fundamentally flawed and entirely baseless.</P>
<P>66. First, it ignores the limits on the courts' supervisory jurisdiction. The relief sought by the Applicants is in the nature of a material amendment to the IRSSA, which itself contains no provision for IAP claims to be brought to the courts. The silence of the IRSSA in this regard is intentional and must be contrasted with the court access provisions for CEP appeals and Article 12 applications. It is impermissible for the courts to amend the IRSSA without all parties' consent.</P>
<P>67. Second, the Applicants overstate the role of the supervisory courts in ensuring that claimants receive &ldquo;the promised benefits&rdquo; of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Memorandum of Argument of the Applicants, dated August 28, 2017 at paras 23, 28. REO Application Record, Tab 5 at 87-88, 89.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Contrary to the Applicants' position, compensation is not promised by the IRSSA, but the right for eligible claimants to access the IAP within a defined timeframe is. The <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold in no way limits claimants' access to the &ldquo;promised benefits&rdquo; of the IAP, and applies only after such access has been realized.</P>
<P>68. Third, the Applicants overstate the inconsistencies in the jurisprudence relating to the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold. As demonstrated, the jurisprudence on point is voluminous and consistent. All examples of contrary case law have been reversed:
<P1>(a) <UNDER>Decisions overturned on appeal.</UNDER> In the present case, the MBCA's decision corrected a jurisdictional overstep by the Supervisory Judge of Manitoba. Similarly, in the 2017 <EM>Spanish Appeal</EM> decision, the Court of Appeal for Ontario overturned Perell J's 2016 <EM>Spanish RFD</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> decision which purported to exercise an appellate jurisdiction over the IAP by way of the now discredited theory of &ldquo;curial review jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 34, 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) <UNDER>Decisions treated unfavourably by later appellate jurisprudence.</UNDER> The 2014 <EM>Residents Decision</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al v Canada (Attorney General) et al</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> by Schulman J was critiqued and not followed by Beard JA for the MBCA in the decision below.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) <UNDER>Decisions later been reversed by the same court.</UNDER> In the 2015 <EM>REO Fees RFD</EM> decision, Schulman J implicitly reversed his 2014 <EM>Residents RFD</EM> decision by properly applying the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>REO Fees RFD</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 60 at para 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the <EM>H-15019/Metatawabin/K-10106 RFD</EM> decision, Perell J expressly noted that his 2014 <EM>St. Anne's RFD</EM> decision would have to be read in light of subsequent jurisprudence, with the effect of reversing its interventionist aspects.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>H-15019/Metatawabin/K-10106 RFD</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 71 at para 75.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>69. Finally, the Applicants ignore the practical reality that the IRSSA is a time-limited agreement. The Western Administrative Judge has already imposed hard deadlines on applications for judicial recourse, which in many cases have now expired.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFD's #1</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 14 at para 228.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. The Applicants therefore provide no basis to disturb the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold other than their own dissatisfaction with the results of its application in this case.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Conclusion: No Issue of Public Importance</TI>
<P>71. No issue of public importance arises from the proposed appeal. The Applicants' suggestion that judicial review ought to be available from the IAP is contradicted by the delicately balanced threshold for judicial recourse, developed by superior and appellate courts in full consideration of the terms and context of the IRSSA. The proposed appeal threatens the integrity of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>72. While the IRSSA itself is an agreement of significant importance, the narrow issues here are not. The proposed appeal concerns a fact-driven inquiry regarding the proper interpretation of the IRSSA, implicitly centred on the question of whether the IRSSA contains any provision permitting access to the courts following the resolution of an IAP claim. The factual and legal answer is that it does not, and that the courts have therefore recognized a very high threshold to challenge the actions of the Chief Adjudicator.</P>
<P>73. Moreover, the reach of the decision below is limited to the small subset of IAP claims upon whic h judicial recourse is not already barred by the timelines implemented by the Western Administrative Judge in <EM>the Bundled RFDs #1</EM> decision.</P>
<P>74. The Applicants' leave application should be dismissed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;COSTS</TI>
<P>75. Canada requests the Applicant REO Law be ordered to pay the costs of this application.</P>
<P>76. There is no basis for the Applicants' request for costs in any event of the cause. The legal and interpretative questions raised on the present application, as well as on the underlying proceeding, have long had clear answers. The default rule of costs in the cause ought to apply.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>77. Canada requests that the Applicants' application for leave to appeal be dismissed, and that costs follow in the cause.</P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted this 3<SUP>rd</SUP> day of October, 2017.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>MEMORANDUM OF ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. The Assembly of First Nations (&ldquo;AFN&rdquo;) supports the application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, of the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal dated May 30, 2017, which held that IAP Claimants have no recourse to the Courts for modifications to the IAP model and/or unreasonable and erroneous interpretations by adjudicators in the Independent Assessment Process (&ldquo;IAP&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. This appeal pertains to the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (&ldquo;IRSSA&rdquo;) and, more specifically, the IAP that was created pursuant to the IRSSA to compensate residential school survivors who were victims of abuse, including sexual abuse.</P>
<P>3. The IAP supports healing and reconciliation among former students of Indian Residential Schools, their families and communities, which stresses the importance of establishing clear and unambiguous guidelines for the implementation of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>4. This appeal also raises an issue of law that is of public importance. The Courts below have greatly narrowed the scope of judicial supervision and severely limited recourse available to residential school survivors who have proved abuse, but nonetheless been denied compensation in the IAP. As one of the effects of participating in the IAP is to release Canada and Churches from liability for abuse suffered, barring access to any form of oversight may deprive the victims of the compensation they are entitled to.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Statement of Facts</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i)</N><TI>IRSSA</TI>
<P>5. The AFN is a signatory to the IRSSA. The IRSSA is a negotiated settlement of numerous class actions brought against the Government of Canada and various church entities for damages suffered by former students of Indian Residential Schools. The IRSSA was executed by all Parties on May 8, 2006.</P>
<P>6. The IRSSA seeks to remedy harms and abuses suffered by former residential school students through delivering a fair resolution, which will promote &ldquo;healing, education, truth and reconciliation and commemoration. Compensation under the IRSSA includes two different elements to address the legacy of Indian Residential Schools:
<ITEM><P>a Common Experience Payment (CEP) for all eligible former students of Indian Residential Schools; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>an Independent Assessment Process (IAP) for claims of sexual or serious physical abuse.</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii)</N><TI>The IAP</TI>
<P>7. The IAP is established by the IRSSA through Article 6 and Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;. The IAP provides a customized adjudicative process for the resolution of claims of serious physical abuse, sexual abuse or other wrongful acts suffered while attending an Indian Residential School covered under the IRSSA.</P>
<P>8. The IAP is a form of litigation which is altered in order to meet the adjudicative criteria for testing the evidence, while also considering claimants' welfare. The process is an inquisitorial system which serves the dual purpose of assessing claimants' credibility and the harms suffered by them.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 839</CITE><PARANUM>29-30</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 1671</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>9. The IAP is a court ordered process created for the sole purpose of resolving former students' continuing claims for serious abuse, in which Canada is a litigant. The IRSSA has been characterized as a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo;, including the IAP compensation rules. The compensation rules provide an award for the stipulated compensable acts, consequential harms, aggravating factors, future care, loss of opportunity, and actual income loss. No party may amend the IAP compensation rules.</P>
<P>10. The IAP Model is composed of a hearing and begins with a claim submission by the claimant. The claimant can either accept the decision or request a review. Compensation is determined through the use of a point system composed of categories. The sum of this assessment will determine the monetary value that ranges from $5000&ndash;275,000 in compensation.</P>
<P>11. The IAP model established by the Parties to the IRSSA, is significantly different from the adjudicative models utilized by other tribunals in Canada. Parties have different procedural rights that may apply elsewhere. The role of adjudicators is inquisitorial, not investigative. The IAP prescribes procedures that adjudicators are required to follow without deviation. Some specific directions given to adjudicators found in Appendix IX include the following:
<QUOTE><P>Compensation for proven continuing claims is to be determined exclusively pursuant to the Compensation Rules. The Rules are designed to ensure that compensation is assessed on an individualized basis. While the abuse suffered is an important indicator of the appropriate level of compensation, so too are the circumstances in which the abuse was suffered by the individual, and the particular impacts it had on him or her.</P>
<P>The Compensation Rules were expressly designed to avoid a mechanistic approach to compensation by recognizing that a relatively less serious act can have severe consequences, and vice versa. They accomplish this goal by requiring both an objective assessment of the severity of the abusive act, and then a distinct and highly subjective assessment of how that act affected the individual Claimant. Accordingly, the categories defining acts and harms must be assessed separately, and the words in each category must be read purposively within their respective contexts.</P>
<P>In particular, in determining the level of harm suffered by a Claimant, adjudicators are to consider each of the five categories as a whole, and in relation to the other categories, rather than focusing on isolated words within a given category. This IAP calls for a contextual consideration, having particular regard to the headings for each category, in order to determine which of the categories best reflects the Claimant's proven level of harms resulting from compensable abuse.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. Adjudicators are required to adhere to the IAP model. Adjudicators do not have any authority, nor are they permitted to deviate from the rules regarding the categories of proven acts. Once a proven act has been determined according to the rules stipulated under Schedule D, the adjudicator may then exercise some discretion to choose the point level with in that range.</P>
<P>13. In <CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Winkler required the administration of the IAP to be under the direction of the Court, not Canada. The Court held that &ldquo;the administrative function must be completely isolated from the litigation function with an autonomous supervisor or supervisory board reporting ultimately to the courts.&rdquo; This was accomplished by the Implementation Orders ensuring that the Chief Adjudicator would be confirmed by, report to, and take direction from the Courts, and not from Canada.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada</SOC><CITE>83 O.R. (3d) 481</CITE><PARANUM>37-38</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii)</N><TI>The IAP Compensation Model</TI>
<P>14. Schedule D of the IRSSA sets out the categories of abuse covered under the IAP. The categories of abuse are apportioned according to the severity of the abuse in a scale that begins with SL1 for less severe acts of abuse ending with SL5 for severe acts of sexual abuse.</P>
<P>15. There are four types of abuse within the SL1 category. The last of these four subcategories (SL1.4) and the subject of this appeal is as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Any touching of a student, including touching with an object, by an adult employee or other adult lawfully on the premises which exceeds recognized parental contact and violates the sexual integrity of the student.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. In assessing allegations of abuse, an adjudicator is first required to make a determination that the acts of abuse have been proven on the civil standard of proof. Once the act is proven, the adjudicator has discretion to choose the point level within the pre-set range stipulated by Schedule D. The second requirement of an adjudicator is an assessment of the proven consequential harms which flowed from an act of abuse. This is also set out in a scale whereby the lowest level H1 covers a modest detrimental impact and the highest level H5 covers continued harm resulting in serious dysfunction. Only a plausible link between the proven act and harm is required for an order of compensation.</P>
<P>17. Once the act(s) of abuse and consequential harms have been established an adjudicator must then determine whether any of the listed aggravating factors have been proven. The IAP takes into account that the presence of aggravating factors can make acts of abuse worse and, thus, a claimant may be entitled to further compensation. Only those aggravating factors listed in Schedule D may be taken into account by an adjudicator. The final steps in the IAP process are an assessment of a loss of opportunity, actual income loss, future care and a final assessment of compensation.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Decision of Supervising Judge</TI>
<P>18. The Supervising Judge found the courts have the power to review the decision of a Re-Review adjudicator to determine whether the adjudicator failed to apply the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP Compensation Rules. The Supervising Judge acknowledged that this type of review is reserved for exceptional cases.</P>
<P>19. The Supervising Judge found that the determining factor in the adjudicator's decision was the finding that J.W., who was six years old at the time, had not shown that the act of the nun at his residential school grabbing his penis had a sexual purpose. The adjudicator written:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Claimant counsel argued that there is no requirement to prove sexual intent on the part of a person at interest at SL1 when the incident involves an adult and a student... With respect, I disagree</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>In this process an adjudicator must be satisfied in regard to any allegations of sexual abuse that what took place was done for a sexual purpose</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Although I appreciate that touching of the penis is a very sexual part of the body, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there was a sexual purpose associated with the nun's conduct</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Paras 23&ndash;25 of adjudicator's reasons</P1></P>
<P>20. The adjudicator had expressly found that it was a &ldquo;technical requirement&rdquo; of the IAP that the claimant had to prove on a balance of probabilities that the perpetrator had a &ldquo;sexual intent&rdquo; and touched the claimant &ldquo;for a sexual purpose&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21. The Supervising Judge found that the requirement of a sexual intention is not present in SL1.4. Moreover, in dismissing J.W.'s claim, the adjudicator had not addressed the question of whether J.W.'s sexual integrity had been violated.</P>
<P>22. In assessing the jurisdiction of his own Court, the Supervising Judge stated that the parties were in agreement that a Supervising Judge has the power to issue directions when the court is satisfied that the Chief Adjudicator or his delegate has failed to properly implement the IRSSA. The Supervising Judge found that he could intervene only if the final decision of the re-review adjudicator reflected a failure to comply with the terms of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>23. Having established his own jurisdiction as being limited, the Supervising Judge proceeded to consider whether the adjudicator and review adjudicator's decisions reflected a failure to properly apply the terms of the IRSSA. He found that their interpretation of SL1.4 was &ldquo;fundamentally inconsistent with the plain language of SL1.4&rdquo;. The Supervising Judge identified three errors that led to this interpretation: (i) the addition of the adjective &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;touching&rdquo; in the statute, (ii) the adjudicator's insistence that proof of a sexual purpose was needed to establish a claim for violation of sexual integrity, and (iii) the misapplication of the <EM>Chase</EM> case.</P>
<P>24. Having identified the errors in the adjudicator's reasoning, the Supervising Judge concluded that she had misapplied the IRSSA and that these errors should have been corrected on review. Since they had not, the Supervising Judge ordered that the matter be remitted to a first level adjudicator, to be reconsidered with the instructions of the Supervising Judge.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>Decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba</TI>
<P>25. In reasons written by Justice Beard, the Court of Appeal overturned the Order of the Supervising Judge. The Manitoba Court of Appeal held that the Supervising Judge erred in his interpretation of his jurisdiction to hear and determine the Request for Direction. The Court of Appeal determined that jurisdiction was limited to determining whether the adjudicator implemented the provisions of the IAP in the narrow sense of considering the correct terms. Once it was determined that the adjudicator considered the correct terms, his jurisdiction ended and should have dismissed the Request for Direction.
<P1>Decision of the MBCA at para 72</P1></P>
<P>26. The Court of Appeal held that the Supervising Judge substituted a higher standard of review of &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case&rdquo;, which results in carrying out an appeal or judicial review of the adjudication and review decision. The Court of Appeal is of the view that IAP compensation decisions are not subject to either an appeal or judicial review by the courts on any standard.</P>
<P>27. In determining the review process, the Court of Appeal noted that broadening the review process went beyond the extremely limited recourse to the courts that was permitted in <EM>Schachter</EM>. The Court of Appeal found that this would significantly increase the time required to complete an individual and overall claims process, which fails to respect the objectives of providing a closed and expeditious adjudication process.</P>
<P>28. The Court of Appeal emphasized that over 26,000 IAP claims have been held over the last ten years. The Court of Appeal appears to be preoccupied with the proposition that if J.W.'s appeal is successful, all past IAP claims would be open to review by the courts. The Court noted that Judges may disagree with an adjudicator's unreasonable interpretation of the IAP, however, such unreasonable interpretations are not subject to review.</P>
<P>29. This concern does not logically follow from the facts of this case. The applicant's appeal rests on SL1.4 exclusively and does not bring the entire IAP process into question. If his appeal is allowed, only a very small fraction of past IAP cases&mdash;those pertaining to minor sexual assaults as defined by SL1.4&mdash;would be open to review by the courts. Indeed, clarification of SL1.4 by the Supreme Court would serve to bolster the finality of the IAP process by ending erroneous interpretations of SL1.4 and thereby ensuring that victims of minor sexual assaults receive the compensation for which they bargained when the IRSSA was drafted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF ISSUES</TI>
<P>30. The Applicants submit that the proposed appeal raises the following issues:
<P1>a. Did the Manitoba Court of Appeal err in finding that the lower Court did not have jurisdiction to review an IAP decision, which denied J.W.'s claim?</P1>
<P1>b. Did the Court of Appeal err in determining that the original adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP model did not amount to modifying the IRSSA?</P1>
<P1>c. Is there any general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review or judicial recourse in cases pertaining to administrative tribunals which are formed pursuant to the terms of a class action settlement?</P1>
<P1>d. Is the Manitoba Court of Appeal incorrect in holding that claimants whose IAP claims are denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRSSA have no recourse to the courts supervising the implementation, enforcement and administration of the IRSSA?</P1></P>
<P>31. The Respondent, AFN, submits that the legal issues identified by the Applicant in its Memorandum of Argument are of public importance, raise new questions of mixed fact and law and are of national importance.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Issues of Public Importance with regard to individual Claimant IAP outcomes</TI>
<P>32. Whether the Manitoba Court of Appeal erred in determining that the Supervising Court's intervention in the IAP decision regarding J.W.'s claim for sexual abuse suffered in a residential school is an issue of public importance.</P>
<P>33. Although IAP adjudicators, as well as other administrative tribunals, are to operate with a high degree of independence and deference is owed to their decision makers, any adjudicator must operate within the terms of either an enabling statute or contractual provisions, which in this case is the IRSSA. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada will have precedential value in other IAP decisions providing guidance and a clearer process for all parties.</P>
<P>34. Although an adjudicator is free to interpret written directives, in this case, the IAP model does not extend any leeway to modifying the IRSSA and thereby changing its meaning. Any modifying of the IRSSA by adjudicators is prohibited and requires the unanimous consent of the Parties to the IRSSA.</P>
<P>35. As the Supervising Judge aptly pointed out, the adjudicator's interpretation of SL1.4 was seriously flawed. She had written: &ldquo;<EM>the question is whether or not the incident was sexual touching which exceeded recognized parental contact and violated the sexual integrity of the student</EM>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>36. The adjective &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; is not actually found in the text of SL1.4 of Schedule D. The adjudicator went on to state that although the penis is a very sexual part of the body, she was denying J.W. compensation on the basis that he had not shown that the assailant had a sexual intent when she inappropriately touched him.</P>
<P>37. As the Supervising Judge further noted, the adjudicator's re-wording of the statute is legally absurd, as it implies that an adult can sexually touch a child and that in some circumstances, this would be within the bounds of recognized parental conduct.</P>
<P>38. Moreover, the adjudicator applied a criminal test found in the <EM>Chase</EM> case, in which this Honourable Court interpreted the words &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; in the Criminal Code context. At issue was whether a subjective intention on the part of an assailant to commit a sexual assault was required in order to prove the offense. This Honourable Court concluded in <EM>Chase</EM> that, while the perpetrator's subjective intention was a factor to be considered, it was not a requirement that this intention be present for the offense to occur, nor was it a determinative factor.</P>
<P>39. Given that the adjudicator's decision could not have been reached without the addition of the adjective &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; to the text of SL1.4, and that her discretionary decision making power did not extend to re-writing the IRSSA, the court's intervention in this matter was warranted.</P>
<P>40. The Manitoba Court of Appeal's concern for reopening cases that were impacted by a wrong application of the IAP is not a valid reason to deny justice or compensation to victims of sexual abuse. The Manitoba Court of Appeal held:
<QUOTE><P>There is another reason why this difference is important. The court's jurisdiction was described in Schachter as applying in &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; and &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; circumstances (at paras 53, 57). If the jurisdiction includes the right to determine whether there had been an unreasonable interpretation of a term of the IRSSA or IAP, the court's jurisdiction would be extended to many, rather than limited or exceptional, cases. As Sharpe JA said in the Perell appeal, the SJ's disagreement with the adjudicator's conclusion does not equate to a failure to enforce or apply the IAP and justify judicial intervention. If it did, all IAP decisions would be appealable.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Decision of the MBCA at para 54</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Appeals Court Judge fails to consider whether adjudicator's actions amounted to re-writing the SL1.4.</TI>
<P>41. The Court of Appeal found that the question of whether or not the Supervising Judge had jurisdiction to review the conclusions of the IAP in J.W.'s case was a question of law and thus, reviewable on a standard of correctness. Moreover, he found that the <EM>Schachter</EM> case established that the right to seek judicial recourse is limited to very exceptional circumstances. One of these circumstances is a failure on the part of the adjudicator to consider the terms of the IRSSA and its implementation orders.
<P1>Schachter, paras 52-53, 55</P1></P>
<P>42. The Court of Appeal stated that there is an important distinction between the failure to consider the terms of the IRSSA or the implementation orders on one hand, and the correctness/reasonableness of the interpretation of those terms, on the other. The Court of Appeal's decision stands for the proposition that while the Courts may disagree with an adjudicator's unreasonable interpretation and/or decision, any untenable interpretation of the IAP model by an adjudicator will nonetheless comply with the IRSSA and will not equate to a failure to apply the IAP model.
<P1>2017 MBCA 54, paras 42-43</P1></P>
<P>43. However, the Supervising Judge did not overturn the review adjudicator's decision on the basis of disagreement; he found that she had endorsed an interpretation of the IRSSA that was so untenable that it amounted to failure to apply the terms of the IRSSA. In doing so, she overstepped her authority as an administrative decision-maker and reached a conclusion that cannot be reconciled with section SL1.4 of Schedule D of the IRSSA.
<P1>Decision of the MBQB, at para 54.</P1></P>
<P>44. The Supervising Judge overturned the adjudicator's decision on the basis that it failed to consider the terms of the IRSSA by adding an adjective to SL1.4 that altered its meaning. Any resemblance to the former standard of patent unreasonableness is purely incidental and did not constitute grounds to overturn the Supervising Judge's decision.</P>
<P>45. The Court of Appeal failed to consider whether the adjudicator's improper re-wording of SL1.4 amounted to a failure to apply the terms of the IRSSA. Thus, the Supervising Judge's conclusions were not overturned on the basis of any legal principle, but rather the Appeal's Judge rather tenuous finding that the Supervising Judge had reviewed the adjudicator's decision based on a standard of reasonableness.</P>
<P>46. Although the Supervising Judge could perhaps have been more precise in the terminology he employed, the crux of his reasoning was based on the adjudicator's modifying SL1.4 and thereby reaching a decision that did not respect the terms of the IRSSA.</P>
<P>47. Canada correctly pointed out in the appeal that according to the terms of the IAP, there is no stare decisis; adjudication decisions are not binding on other adjudicators. Each is free to arrive at his or her own interpretation; thus, it is anticipated within the IAP that there may be differing interpretations. While this is certainly true, the absence of precedential value and openness to interpretation does not permit an adjudicator to rewrite key provisions of the IAP model. This is a clear violation of the confines of the role of an administrative decision maker.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Is there any generally applicable rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review in cases where an administrative tribunal has been constituted pursuant to the terms of a class action lawsuit?</TI>
<P>48. There is no general rule of law that restricts the availability of judicial review in cases pertaining to administrative tribunals which are formed pursuant to the terms of a class action settlement. Indeed, supervising judges must ensure that the terms of any agreement reached as a result of a class action settlement are respected and that claimants receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Even in the absence of express provisions for judicial oversight, an administrative tribunal can never operate with total independence from the Superior Courts.</P>
<P>49. Superior Courts possess inherent jurisdiction. All administrative tribunals and/or adjudicative processes are the creations of either a statute or a contractual agreement and therefore, do not possess the inherent jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. The IAP was established through the IRSSA. Although the right to judicial review can be restricted, it can never be completely excluded. This principle was succinctly enunciated in the Dunsmuir case:
<QUOTE><P>By virtue of the Constitution, superior courts are the only courts that possess inherent jurisdiction. They are responsible both for applying the laws enacted by Parliament and the legislatures and for insuring that statutory bodies respect their legal boundaries. Parliament and the legislatures cannot totally exclude judicial oversight without overstepping the division between legislative or executive powers and judicial powers. Superior courts are, in the end, the protectors of the integrity of the rule of law and the justice system. Judicial review of administrative action is rooted in these fundamental principles and its boundaries are largely informed by the roles of the respective branches of government.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 S.C.R. 190</CITE><PARANUM>159</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>50. Furthermore, the IRSSA approval Orders states &ldquo;this Court shall supervise the implementation of the Agreement and this judgment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may issue such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the Agreement and this judgment&rdquo;. This language requires the superior courts to supervise the implementation of the IRRSA, including the IAP, for compliance.</P>
<P>51. The doctrine of the separation of powers requires that administrative tribunals and adjudicative processes like the IAP, which was created through the IRSSA, remain under the supervision of superior courts, which retain final judicial authority.</P>
<P>52. Of particular importance is the fourth factor set out in Dunsmuir to determine whether intervention in an administrative tribunal's decision is warranted: the object of the statute. In this case, the object of the IRSSA is to provide compensation to victims of abuse in residential schools. In merging the numerous lawsuits filed against the government of Canada and various churches, the IRSSA sought to simplify a massive undertaking and ensure that victims of residential school abuse obtained the compensation to which they were entitled. Failure to provide this compensation is contrary to one of the objects of the IRSSA.
<P1><EM>Dunsmuir at paragraph 160</EM></P1></P>
<P>53. At the conclusion of her inquiry into J.W.'s claim, the adjudicator stated that she was &ldquo;satisfied that the incident with the nun happened as he described&rdquo;. In other words, she was satisfied that J.W. suffered an incident of sexual abuse, since an adult grabbing a child's penis for no recognized medicinal or therapeutic purpose is clearly sexual abuse.</P>
<P>54. She denied compensation based on a warped construction of SL1.4 which added a requirement of sexual intention that is not present in the provision and cannot be construed by any interpretation of the existing wording. Indeed, the adjudicator effectively added an adjective to the provision, changing its meaning, which she was certainly not entitled to do by virtue of her contractually created powers. There is no principle in administrative law that allows such a flagrant misinterpretation of a provision to stand. Courts must ensure the protection of its processes to ensure that justice is done.</P>
<P>55. Furthermore, the adjudicator's addition of the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; in the SL1.4 category is not permissible. The IRRSA provides that &ldquo;standards for compensable wrongs and for the assessment of compensation have been defined for this IAP. The adjudicator is bound by those standards.&rdquo; By rewriting the standards for compensable wrongs, the adjudicator failed to apply an applicable provision of IAP model in J.W.'s case.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Was the Manitoba Court of Appeal correct when it held that claimants whose IAP claims are denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRSSA have no recourse to the courts supervising the implementation, enforcement and administration of the IRSSA?</TI>
<P>56. There is recourse available for claimants whose IAP claims are denied based on unreasonable interpretations of the IRSSA to the courts supervising its implementation, enforcement and administration. Jurisprudence is clear that court intervention is warranted if the interpretation of a statute is unreasonable and does not engage with the appropriate elements of statutory interpretation.</P>
<P>57. The parameters referred to by the Appeals Judge in <EM>Schachter</EM> (paras 53, 57) allow the court jurisdiction in &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; and &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; circumstances to intervene in a matter. The Court of Appeal stated that unreasonable interpretation of a term of the IRSSA or IAP would not constitute a failure within the <EM>Schachter</EM> parameters. The Court of Appeal failed to engage with the facts of the case that constitute a failure of the IRSSA and IAP Model.</P>
<P>58. The interpretation of the IRSSA is to follow a contractual approach that advances the intent of all the parties. The words in the agreement should be given their ordinary and literal meaning and not be read in isolation, but in harmony with the agreement as a whole. This holistic interpretation of the IRSSA is expressed.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>59. Moreover, the scope of &ldquo;reasonable outcomes&rdquo; must be taken into consideration. As suggested in both <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v Canadian Human Rights Commission</SOC></CASEREF> [<EM>Canadian Human Rights Commission</EM>] and <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v Jagjit Singh Farwaha</SOC></CASEREF>, Stratas J.A. suggested that the extent of the &ldquo;range&rdquo; will depend primarily on the nature of the question, with a broader range for questions of fact and policy, a narrower one for legal questions. Stratas J.A. in <EM>Canadian Human Rights Commission</EM> states that interpretation of must fall inside a &ldquo;range&rdquo; of reasonable outcomes. The IRSSA interpretation of the SL1.4 compensation rule would be narrower. Further, the implementation of the test for sexual assault from the Chase case warrants the court's intervention into this matter. On simple plain-language analysis of SL1.4, clearly a child's sexual integrity can be violated without a perpetrator having any sexual intent. This Honourable Court noted that the failure of applying the proper legal test will mark the decision with unreasonableness in <CASEREF><SOC>Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>60. Further, statutory interpretation does not warrant deference if the provision is clear, as stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</SOC></CASEREF>. Evans J.A. suggested: &ldquo;if a reviewing court concludes that one interpretation is &lsquo;right&rsquo;, after conducting a textual, contextual, and purposive interpretative analysis of the legislation, and giving careful and respectful consideration to the tribunal's reasons...the court may intervene to ensure administrative compliance with the legislature's clearly expressed intention&rdquo;. The clear interpretation of SL1.4 was not considered with the errors of the adjudicator inserting words and implementing legal tests improperly.</P>
<P>61. This is followed in the Supreme Court decision <CASEREF><SOC>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>. Moldaver J. states, &ldquo;Where the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation lead to a single reasonable interpretation and the administrative decision maker adopts a different interpretation, its interpretation will necessarily be unreasonable&mdash;no degree of deference can justify its acceptance&rdquo;.</P>
<P>62. The implementation of an alien legal test from the <EM>Chase</EM> case along with improper insertion of words that fundamentally change the meaning of the compensation rule SL1.4 is not only unreasonable, but falls outside a range of acceptable outcomes. Court intervention is necessary in this matter to ensure administrative compliance and to inform not only claimants, but adjudicators of the substance of the IRSSA and IAP model.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>63. The fundamental issue at stake in this case is whether or not IAP Claimants have judicial recourse where the IAP model is not applied properly or where adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP model in untenable. The Courts below hove essentially closed the door to any judicial recourse for IAP claimants. This Honourable Courts direction will have precedential value and add clarity to other IAP proceedings.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I. OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. The proposed appeal seeks to overturn the established law across Canada regarding the jurisdiction of courts to interfere with decisions made by specializedad judicators in a post settlement claims adjudication process negotiated by parties to a class action. The Independent Assess ment Process (the &ldquo;<BOLD>IAP</BOLD>&rdquo;) was established under the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>IRSSA</BOLD>&rdquo;) to assess the claims of those who suffered serious physical or sexual abuse at an Indian Residential School (&ldquo;<BOLD>IRS</BOLD>&rdquo;). The goal was to have a fair and expeditious determination of a large number of claims. To achieve this, the parties to the IRSSA agreed on specific and unique compensation rules, to be applied under a tailor-made inquisitorial process, conducted by adjudicators chosen by the parties pursuant to agreed upon criteria. The parties provided for two levels of internal review, but no court review of IAP decisions. The parties incorporated the details of the claims adjudication process into the IRSSA, and provided for ongoing supervision of its operation by committees composed of the various parties and stakeholders in the IRSSA. The IRRSA is incorporated into, and given effect by, court orders.</P>
<P>2. The applicant tries to frame the appeal as raising a general question of law regarding the availability of judicial review. Because the IAP is not an administrative tribunal but rather a claims adjudication process created by a contract and given the force of a court order, it is clear that judicial review is not available. The applicant cannot point to a single case that is inconsistent with or calls into question this determination. It is not a matter that requires the attention of this Court.</P>
<P>3. With respect to whether there is some other form of judicial recourse to overturn adjudicators' decisions made in the IAP, in every jurisdiction that has considered the question, the courts have determined that the parties intended the court's role to be limited to intervening in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; and that there is no jurisdiction for courts to create a new level of appeal based on a &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; standard. The decision of the Court below is consistent with two unanimous decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal and all decisions on the issue by the British Columbia courts. There is no controlling authority, in any province or territory, contrary to what was decided in the decision appealed from. There is no need for the intervention of this Court.</P>
<P>4. The applicant further argues that the appeal should be granted because the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; standard was wrongly applied in this particular case. It is clear this concern is specific to the applicant, and raises no question of public or national importance to attract a review by this Court.</P>
<P>5. The Chief Adjudicator submits that the possibility of allowing judicial review of IAP decisions would create profound uncertainty and unfairness to all the previous claimants who thought their IAP claims were complete. It also risks reneging on the promise between the parties of the IRSSA to create an expeditious, closed, and final adjudicative process in which the parties themselves select the adjudicators by unanimous vote. There is no public or national interest that would be served by granting leave to appeal in this case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Facts</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>The IRSSA</TI>
<P>6. The terms of the IRSSA are the result of lengthy and detailed negotiations regarding the settlement of numerous Indian residential school class actions. The IRSSA itself is given force through court orders (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Implementation Orders</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Implementation Orders, issued by nine courts across Canada, <EM>inter alia</EM>, incorporate by reference all of the terms of the IRSSA, and provide for a procedure to permit an application to the courts for directions by way of a request for directions (&ldquo;<BOLD>RFD</BOLD>&rdquo;) regarding the implementation and administration of the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dated May 30, 2016 (&ldquo;<BOLD>MBCA Reasons</BOLD>&rdquo;) at para. 5, Applicant's Application for Leave to Appeal (&ldquo;<BOLD>ALA</BOLD>&rdquo;) Tab 4, p. 50</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. The goals of the IRSSA, as set out in the preamble, are to achieve a &ldquo;fair, comprehensive and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools&rdquo; and to promote healing, education, commemoration, and truth and reconciliation. The IRSSA achieves these goals in four ways: (a) providing compensation to former students of residential schools; (b) establishing a truth and reconciliation process; (c) finding and implementing healing programs; and (d) resolving all outstanding litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 241</CITE><PARANUM>19-20</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. There are two components of the IRSSA aimed at providing individuals with compensation. The Common Experience Payment (&ldquo;<BOLD>CEP</BOLD>&rdquo;), set out in Article 5, is a class-wide one time payment based solely on the length of time that an individual resided at the IRS. The IAP, set out in Article 6 and Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; of the IRSSA, is a <EM>sui generis</EM> inquisitorial process under which claimants must prove they suffered serious physical or sexual abuse or other wrongful acts as defined in the IAP Compensation Rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at para. 7, ALA Tab 4, p. 51. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; Independent Assessment Process (IAP) For Continuing Indian Residential School Abuse Claims (&ldquo;<BOLD>Sched D</BOLD>&rdquo;) can be found online at <UNDER>http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/Schedule_D-IAP.PDF</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The Chief Adjudicator is the Officer of the Court responsible for overseeing the IAP and supervising the adjudicators who hear IAP claims. The Chief Adjudicator also has the authority to formulate and implement policies, guidelines, and directions dealing with t he procedural aspects of IAP claims. The Chief Adjudicator possesses &ldquo;broad discretion&rdquo; and &ldquo;relative expertise.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE><PARANUM>54, 78</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Schachter</EM></BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Chief Adjudicator does not exercise any statutory powers. All of his powers derive from the Implementation Orders and the IRSSA.</P>
<P>10. The IAP Oversight Committee is established pursuant to Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, art. III(r), and consists of a chair and 8 other members, 2 from each of the following constituencies: former students (represented by the AFN and the Inuit Representatives), plaintiffs' counsel (including Independent Counsel and the National Consortium), church entities (Catholic and Protestant) and government.</P>
<P>11. While there is no provision for an appeal to the courts on any basis, the parties agreed that specific guidance on the interpretation and application of the IAP Model can be provided by the parties themselves. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, art. III(r)(iii) provides that the Oversight Committee may give instructions on the &ldquo;interpretation and application of the IAP Model.&rdquo; The Chief Adjudicator, pursuant to Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, art. III(s)(i) can prepare such recommendations to be considered for approval by the Oversight Committee. Such instructions are subject to certain limitations, and must be approved by the National Administration Committee (the &ldquo;<BOLD>NAC</BOLD>&rdquo;) before coming into force. The NAC is made up of 5 representatives from plaintiffs' groups, one from the government and one from the churches. Instructions are effective once approved by the NAC and published by the Oversight Committee, but only bind participants with 2 weeks notice before their hearing.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>The IAP</TI>
<P>12. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the IRSSA sets out the parties' detailed agreement about how the IAP is to operate, including the compensation rules to be applied, the qualification, selection and training of adjudicators, and the rights of review.</P>
<P>13. The process revolves around the claimant's hearing, which is a private and confidential one-day proceeding, held at a location of the claimant's choosing,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Subject to hearings being scheduled to promote economy; see Sched D, art. III(j)(i), p. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> with the claimant's support persons present. The hearing is designed to minimize further harm to claimants, but through questioning by the adjudicator, evidence and credibility are tested.</P>
<P>14. The inquisitorial model selected by the parties for the IAP is significantly different than the adjudicative model utilized by many other tribunals and courts in Canada. The adjudicator manages the hearing, questions all the witnesses, and then makes the necessary findings of fact to determine whether, and how much, compensation should be awarded in a particular case. The adjudicator's questioning must both draw out the full story from witnesses (leading questions are permitted where required), and test the evidence that is given (questioning in the form of cross examination is permitted where required).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, art. III(e), pp. 9-10</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Claimants must establish a right to compensation by meeting the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities.</P>
<P>15. Because of the need for a safe and efficient hearing process, parties have different procedural rights than in a court of law. This is particularly true of alleged perpetrators, who have the right to respond to the claimant's allegations and to testify, but not to receive the claimant's personal information or to confront or cross-examine the claimant directly.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, art. III(g), p. 12</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; of the IRSSA also provides for what constitutes a compensable claim, and how compensation is to be calculated. In determining compensation, adjudicators have regard to the acts of abuse proven, and the nature of consequential harms established. The IAP provides for a range of compensation points based on categories of abuse and categories of harm, and adjudicators select a number of points within that range by applying their expertise to the information received through the hearing process. When a claimant submits an IAP application, he or she must set out the wrongs alleged, a narrative, and indicate by reference to the Compensation Rules the categories under which compensation will be sought.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Sched D, Appendix I</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. Article II of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; sets out two separate charts, establishing the categories of compensable acts and consequential harms that can be the subject of an adjudicator's award. The first chart, at page 3 of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, sets out five categories of sexual abuse (SL1&ndash;SL5), one category of physical abuse (PL) and one category of &ldquo;Other Wrongful Acts&rdquo; (OWA). The second chart in Article II sets out five categories of consequential harm. Adjudicators are also required to have regard to a number of aggravating factors, and may also have to consider if any consequential loss of opportunity or income loss has been proven and whether the criteria for an award for future care has been established.</P>
<P>18. Article II of Appendix IX provides further direction to adjudicators on how the Compensation Rules must be applied. It provides:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>Compensation for proven continuing claims is to be determined exclusively pursuant to the Compensation Rules.</UNDER> The Rules are designed to ensure that compensation is assessed on an individualized basis. While the abuse suffered is an important indicator of the appropriate level of compensation, so too are the circumstances in which the abuse was suffered by the individual, and the particular impacts it had on him or her.</P>
<P><UNDER>The Compensation Rules were expressly designed to avoid a mechanistic approach to compensation</UNDER> by recognizing that a relatively less serious act can have severe consequences, and vice versa. <UNDER>They accomplish this goal by requiring both an objective assessment of the severity of the abusive act and then a distinct and highly subjective assessment of how that act affected the individual Claimant.</UNDER> Accordingly, the categories defining acts and harms must be assessed separately, and the words in each category must be read purposively within their respective contexts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, Appendix IX, art. II, p. 34 [emphasis added]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>IAP Adjudicators</TI>
<P>19. IAP Adjudicators are not statutory decision-makers. Rather, IAP Adjudicators are empowered by the Implementation Orders and the IRSSA to make binding findings of credibility, liability and compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, art. III(a)(v)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. The parties to the IRSSA understood that the responsibilities of IAP adjudicators require a unique combination of skills. The Western Administrative Judge has noted:
<QUOTE><P>Recognizing this, the parties agreed that adjudicators should be highly-qualified individuals selected by all-party consensus, who receive intensive training approved by the IAP Oversight Committee and ongoing mentoring by the Chief Adjudicator and other senior adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM></BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. Appendix V of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; sets out the skills and capacities that the parties agreed were essential for those who would be interpreting and applying the IAP to individual claims. Some of these would be expected of any decision maker in an adjudicative process considering personal injury claims, such as knowledge of personal injury law and damages assessment, and a demonstrated ability to assess credibility and reliability. Other criteria are more specialized for the IAP process, such as sensitivity to Aboriginal culture and history, knowledge of and sensitivity to sexual and physical abuse issues, and the ability to elicit useful evidence in a concise manner. It is &ldquo;noteworthy that adjudicators need not be legally trained, so long as they have a combination of related training or significant experience.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at para. 18</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. The parties also agreed to retain control over the appointment of adjudicators. IAP adjudicators are chosen not by the Chief Adjudicator but by the unanimous agreement of a selection board composed of one representative of each of former students, plaintiffs' counsel, church entities and government.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, Appendix XIII</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The selection board is appointed by the Oversight Committee.</P>
<P>23. The Chief Adjudicator is responsible for the training and leadership of the independent adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>There are now about 66 adjudicators, while at one point there 109 adjudicators.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Chief Adjudicator is required to, <EM>inter alia</EM> (a) implement training programs and administrative measures designed to ensure consistency among the decisions of adjudicators in the interpretation and application of the IAP, (b) assess on an ongoing basis the training and mentoring needs of adjudicators and develop appropriate programs; (c) provide advice to ad judicators on compliance with the IAP; and (d) receive complaints about the performance of adjudicators and meet with adjudicators to discuss concerns and develop remedial actions to resolve same if appropriate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, art. III(s)(i)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Training programs for adjudicators that are developed by the Chief Adjudicator are approved by the Oversight Committee. The Chief Adjudicator has implemented a policy of internal reviews of Adjudicator decisions by the Chief Adjudicator's Office, which is published as Guidance Paper 5.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;Policy of Internal Reviews of Adjudicator Decisions by Chief Adjudicator's Office&rdquo; (March 23, 2010), found online at <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/media/information/publication/pdf/directives/gp-5-eng.pdf</UNDER>; &ldquo;The Chief's Adjudicator's Responsibility to Promote Consistency, Coherence and Quality in IAP Decisions: Appendix &ldquo;A&rdquo; to Guidance Paper 5&rdquo; (June, 2009) found online at <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/media/information/publication/pdf/directives/gp-5-sch-a-eng.pdf</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This process helps ensure consistent, high-quality decision-making within a framework that respects the independence of every adjudicator.</P>
<P>25. Article III(m) of Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, provides measures to ensure consistency of decisions, and III(n) provides for the assignment of adjudicators based on their particular expertise. However, the parties specifically provided in Appendix X(5) that the principle of <EM>stare decisis</EM> does not apply:
<QUOTE><P>Although reasons will be issued in each case, the IAP will not operate on the basis of binding precedent. All adjudicators are of equal authority, and should not consider themselves bound by each other's previous decisions. Through conferencing, adjudicators may come to a common interpretation of certain procedural issues, but each case must be determined on its own merits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sched D, Appendix X(3), p. 42</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>IAP Review Process</TI>
<P>26. The rights of review are set out in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, art. III(1). These provide for a first level review by a second adjudicator and a second level review by the Chief Adjudicator or his designate. Both the parties who can seek a review and the grounds for each level of review are specified in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</P>
<P>27. The provisions contemplate that claimants may require a second adjudicator (the first level of review) to review a decision for palpable and overriding error in both standard and complex track claims. Defendants may only request a second adjudicator to review a decision for palpable and overriding error in complex track claims. If a palpable and overriding error is found, the reviewing adjudicator may substitute his or her own decision or order a new hearing. No provision is made for a second review by a re-reviewing adjudicator with respect to palpable and overriding errors.</P>
<P>28. Any party may ask the Chief Adjudicator or his designate to determine whether an adjudicator's decision or a reviewing adjudicator's decision properly applied the IAP Model to the facts &ldquo;as found by the adjudicator.&rdquo; As a result, review for failure to properly apply the IA P Model can take place at the request of either party, and at either level of review. If there has been a failure to apply the IAP Model, the decision may be corrected. The Oversight Committee approves designates to exercise the Chief Adjudicator's review authority to assess whether an original adjudicator has properly applied the IAP Model.</P>
<P>29. Nothing in Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo;, or any other part of the IRSSA, contemplates court review of decisions made by IAP adjudicators. This can be contrasted with other parts of the IRSSA which specifically provide for access to the Courts,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See the following provisions of the IRSSA which explicitly contemplate Court involvement or oversight: art. 4.11(6), 4.11(9), 4.11(12)(j) and 7.01(2), 4.11(12)(k) and 5.09(2) and 5.09(3), 4.11(12)(1) and 12.01(5), 4.11(12)(q) and 6.03(3), 4.11(13), 4(11)(14), 4.12(7), 5.04(3), 13.08(2), 13.08(4)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or other class actions which provide a right of appeal to the courts from the claims process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Court review of a referee's decision is explicitly contemplated in the 1986&ndash;1990 Hepatitis C Settlement Agreement, see <UNDER>http://www.hepc8690.ca/content/documents/agreement/schedulel/articleTen-e.shtml#10.01</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As a result, the courts have characterized the IAP as a &ldquo;closed process&rdquo; and &ldquo;a complete code&rdquo; that limits access to the courts, preserves the finality of the IAP process and respects the expertise of IAP adjudicators.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at paras. 23, 173, 178</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>The Status of the IAP</TI>
<P>30. The IAP has now nearly completed its mandate. 99.8% of all anticipated IAP hearings have already been held: 26,574 in total.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>All statistics are as of August 25, 2017, see <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/stats-eng.php</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Of the 38,099 total claims filed in the IAP, 37,093 (97%) have been resolved. Of the 1,006 unresolved claims, only 42 hearings were scheduled for a later date or waiting scheduling; 443 cases were awaiting decisions, and 521 cases were expected to be resolved through non-hearing means. Over $3.137 billion has been paid to successful claimants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v.

<BLOCK4><TI>The Decisions of the Courts below</TI>
<P>31. A request for directions was brought before Justice Edmond, the supervising judge of Manitoba. The applicants, in the main, asked for a declaration that J.W. suffered sexual abuse as defined at SL1.4 of the IAP Compensation Rules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba, dated April 3, 2016 (&ldquo;<BOLD>MBQB Reasons</BOLD>&rdquo;) at para. 20, ALA Tab 4, p. 12. SL1.4 provides for compensation for &ldquo;any touching of a student, including touching with an object, by an adult employee or another adult lawfully on the premises which exceeds recognized parental contact and violates the sexual integrity of the student.&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicants argued that the adjudicator, review adjudicator, and re-review adjudicator failed to apply the terms of the IAP by interpreting &ldquo;any touching&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;sexual touching&rdquo;; by applying alien jurisprudence from a different context, namely <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Chase</SOC><CITE>[1987] 2 S.C.R. 293</CITE></CASEREF>, a criminal law decision about sexual assault; and by requiring a &ldquo;sexual intent&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sexual purpose&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB Reasons at para. 19, ALA Tab 4, pp. 11-12</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. After reviewing the jurisprudence on the jurisdiction of courts to consider re-review decisions, and placing particular reliance on <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Residents</EM></BOLD>] where Schulman J. held that he had jurisdiction to resolve conflicting interpretations of the words &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;School activities&rdquo;, and <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Spanish RFD SC</EM></BOLD>], where Perell J. held the courts had a &ldquo;general curial jurisdiction&rdquo; over IAP matters, Justice Edmond held that he had the power to review the decision of the re-review adjudicator to determine whether she failed to apply the terms of the IAP Compensation Rules and that this was a limited form of curial review reserved for exceptional circumstances. Justice Edmond went on to say:
<QUOTE><P>I find that my jurisdiction in reviewing the substantive decisions of IAP adjudicators is confined to ensuring that the Re-Review Adjudicator did not endorse a legal interpretation that is so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP to the facts of a particular case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB Reasons at para. 40, ALA Tab 4, pp. 22-23</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>33. On the merits of the interpretation of SL1.4, Justice Edmond concluded that it was not a reasonable interpretation of SL1.4 to require sexual intent or sexual purpose to find sexual assault, and this was not corrected on review or re-review, resulting in a failure to properly apply the terms of the IRSSA and the IAP.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBQB Reasons at paras. 57-58, ALA Tab 4, p. 28</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. By the time the appeal at bar was decided, Perell J.'s decision in <EM>Spanish RFD SC</EM> had been overturned by an unanimous bench at the Ontario Court of Appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 26</CITE></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Spanish RFD CA</EM></BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On appeal in the case at bar, Justice Beard for the Court held that the supervising judge had erred in a similar manner as Perell J. in <EM>Spanish RFD SC</EM>.</P>
<P>35. Justice Beard agreed with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the courts have no &ldquo;general curial jurisdiction&rdquo; and therefore the judge below erred by &ldquo;focusing on the adjudicator's interpretation of the IAP rather than on whether the adjudicator considered the correct terms.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at para. 53, ALA Tab 4, p. 69</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Beard went on to say:
<QUOTE><P>There is another reason why this difference is important. The court's jurisdiction was described in <EM>Schachter</EM> as applying in &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; and &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; circumstances (at paras 53, 57). <UNDER>If the jurisdiction includes the right to determine whether there had been an unreasonable interpretation of a term of the IRSSA or IAP, the court's jurisdiction would be extended to many, rather than limited or exceptional cases.</UNDER> As Sharpe JA said in the Perell appeal, the SJ's disagreement with the adjudicator's conclusion does not equate to a failure to enforce or apply the IAP and justify judicial intervention. <UNDER>If it did, all IAP decisions would be appealable</UNDER> (see para 55).</P>
<P>Further, if the SJ's interpretation of jurisdiction is correct, it is difficult to see why it would not apply to Canada as well, so that Canada could argue that an unreasonable interpretation that resulted in it having to pay compensation that the IRSSA did not intend it to pay was also a failure to properly apply the IAP. <UNDER>This would open the door to further applications to the courts, with the result that access to the courts would be available in many more cases</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at paras. 54-55, ALA Tab 4, pp. 69-70 [emphasis added]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. The Court of Appeal found that the supervising judge erred by introducing the test of &ldquo;so unreasonable that it amounts to a failure to properly apply the IAP.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at para. 56, ALA Tab 4, p. 70</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court also effectively overturned the <EM>Residents</EM> decision, stating that the &ldquo;case is not persuasive&rdquo; and expressly declined to follow it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at para. 68, ALA Tab 4, p. 74</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. Justice Beard concluded by stating:
<QUOTE><P>By determining whether the adjudicator's interpretation of the terms of the IAP was unreasonable (the standard actually applied) and whether the re-reviewing adjudicator's failure to correct that interpretation resulted in a failure to properly apply the terms of the IAP, <UNDER>the SJ was carrying out an appeal or judicial review of the adjudication and review decisions</UNDER>. This he was not entitled to do because the compensation decision of the re-review adjudicator under the IAP was final and not subject to either appeal or judicial review by the courts on any standard. <UNDER>By broadening the review process, the SJ went beyond the extremely limited recourse to the courts that was permitted in <EM>Schachter</EM> and in the Perell appeal. This would have the effect of significantly increasing the time required to complete the individual and overall claims process, thereby failing to respect the objectives of providing a closed and expeditious adjudication process.</UNDER></P>
<P>For these reasons, I would find that the SJ erred in his interpretation of his jurisdiction to hear and determine the RFD. <UNDER>In my view, his jurisdiction was limited to determining whether the adjudicator implemented the provisions of the IAP in the narrow sense of determining whether she considered the correct terms.</UNDER> Once it was determined that she considered the correct terms, being category SL1.4, his jurisdiction ended and he should have dismissed the RFD. <UNDER>Instead, he considered whether she erred by not properly</UNDER> interpreting that category, which was outside his jurisdiction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>MBCA Reasons at paras. 71-72, ALA Tab 4, p. 75 [emphasis added]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II. STATEMENT OF QUESTION IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>38. The only question at issue in this leave application is whether the Applicants' proposed appeal raises issues of public and national importance which require the attention of this Court.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III. STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>39. The Chief Adjudicator submits that no pressing issue of public or national importance requiring the attention of this Court is raised by the proposed appeal. The decision of the Court of Appeal is consistent with all appellate authority on this issue. There is nothing that needs to be corrected or clarified with this body of law to warrant this Court's intervention. The Applicant characterizes the impugned decision as one that has continued the trend of decreasing the availability of judicial intervention in the IAP. However, the Applicant fails to comprehensively examine the entire jurisprudence related to the issue, including the most recent authority from the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Western Administrative Judge (who is the most experienced IRSSA supervising judge).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Justice Brown, the Western Administrative Judge, has since 2009 heard more than 40 RFDs and determined more than 745 CEP Court Appeals: <EM>Double RFD</EM> at para. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A full review of the case law reveals that the proposed appeal is an attempt to change the existing jurisprudence which has consistently held there is no judicial review of IAP decisions and judicial recourse is limited to &ldquo;very extraordinary&rdquo; circumstances.</P>
<P>40. Undermining this body of law would be deleterious to the intent of the IRSSA to create an expeditious, closed, and final adjudicative process. The prospect of adding three potential avenues of judicial review on top of the three levels of adjudication available within the IAP is antithetical to the objective of the IRSSA. The Chief Adjudicator submits that no compelling national or public interest would be served by granting leave in this case.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>There is no need for this Court's direction on whether the IAP, or any other claims adjudication process established by a contract and given the force of a Court order, is subject to judicial review</TI>
<P>41. Every single court that has considered this question has agreed with the decision in <EM>Schachter</EM>&mdash;decisions made by IAP Adjudicators are not subject to judicial review. IAP adjudicators do not exercise any statutory authority. The applicant has pointed to no case authority that would suggest that adjudicators acting pursuant to a settlement agreement are subject to judicial review.</P>
<P>42. Chief Justice Winkler's decision in <EM>Schachter</EM> made it clear that IAP adjudicators are not subject to judicial review:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>The argument regarding judicial review similarly has a fatal flaw. The reality is that the Chief Adjudicator, in conducting a paragraph 19 review, is acting pursuant to the terms of orders issued by nine superior courts</UNDER>. The courts issued those orders through the exercise of jurisdiction arising from the pertinent statutes, rules of court and, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Dutton</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 46</CITE><PARANUM>34</PARANUM></CASEREF> the &ldquo;inherent power to settle the rules of practice and procedure as to disputes brought before them...&rdquo;. Judicial review may be available where a statutory power of decision has been exercised by an inferior tribunal, but a superior court does not judicially review its own order. Here, <UNDER>where the Chief Adjudicator is acting pursuant to a term of the orders issued by superior courts, he cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision subject to judicial review</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General), Direction re Duboff, Edwards, Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><JUDGDATE>dated March 7, 2011</JUDGDATE><DOCKET>File No. 00-CV-192059CP</DOCKET></CASEREF> at para. 19 [emphasis added]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>43. The Court of Appeal agreed, stating:
<QUOTE><P>The Administrative Judge also correctly concluded that there is no right to seek judicial review from a legal fee review decision of the Chief Adjudicator. The court's jurisdiction to issue a declaration under s. 2(1)2 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1 (the &ldquo;JRPA&rdquo;) relates only to &ldquo;the exercise, refusal to exercise or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power&rdquo;. As the Administrative Judge explained, the Chief Adjudicator is not exercising a statutory power of decision, but rather renders his fee review appeal decision pursuant to the authority derived from the implementation orders, as approved by the relevant provincial and territorial superior courts.</P>
<P>The appellant further contends that the office of the Chief Adjudicator is a quasi-judicial public body that is subject to judicial review proceedings by way of an application for an order in the nature of mandamus or certiorari under s. 2(1)2 of the JRPA. I do not agree with this assertion. Judicial review is not available to review the exercise of authority by a judicially created body, which has been given certain duties as provided by the terms of the S. A. and the implementation orders. The office of the Chief Adjudicator was created by order of the courts in approving the negotiated terms of settlement of class action litigation. The authority of that office is exercised in relation to those class members who have elected to advance claims through the IAP and their counsel. The terms of the S.A. and the implementation orders set out the process for reviewing decisions of the IAP Adjudicators. Recourse to the courts is only available if it is provided for in the S. A. or the implementation orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras. 51-52</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>44. As this Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC></CASEREF> makes clear, the availability of judicial review, and the standard of reasonableness which is utilized within that process, are grounded in concerns about maintaining the rule of law and legislative supremacy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>30</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Attempts to insulate decisions made by administrative bodies exercising authority delegated to them by the leg islature from judicial oversight raise these constitutional concerns. This is not the case with a claims adjudication processes developed pursuant to contract, even if the government is one of the parties to the contract.</P>
<P>45. Parties to a class action are entitled, subject to court approval, to design a claims adjudication process as part of the settlement of a class action. In establishing that process, the parties are entitled to decide whether decisions made within that process will be subject to court review and if so, to what extent.</P>
<P>46. Pursuant to the provisions of class action legislation, such as section 35 of <EM>The Class Proceedings Act</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>C.C.S.M. c. C130</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the settlement, including the establishment of any claims adjudication process, must be subject to judicial approval. At that stage, the court must determine whether the claims adjudication system, including the availability or non-availability of recourse to the courts to review substantive decisions of adjudicators, is sufficient. In this case, the IRSSA was given approval by the nine Implementation Orders. Each of those courts thus approved the settlement on the basis that the only rights to court review would be those set out in the IRSSA itself. Justice Winkler, who wrote both the leading decision on approval of the IRSSA,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2006 CanLII 41673</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<BOLD><EM>Baxter</EM></BOLD>]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the first decision in <EM>Schachter</EM>, made it clear that the settlement was approved on this basis.</P>
<P>47. Once the settlement has been approved, the Supervising Courts can issue orders to facilitate the administration of the settlement, but they cannot change the content of the settlement. They cannot provide for a level of court review not provided by the IRSSA.</P>
<P>48. The applicant does not point to any case from any jurisdiction regarding any class action that suggests that judicial review is available to review the decisions of adjudicators appointed by the parties. Even the cases relied on by the applicant at paragraphs 37 and 38 of its memorandum of argument as applying a reasonableness (or modified reasonableness) standard of review do not take issue with the holding in <EM>Schachter</EM> that judicial review is not available.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Residents</EM> at para. 54 (&ldquo;It is not an appeal or a traditional review of the Chief's Adjudicator's decision&rdquo;); MBQB Reasons at paras. 7, 28, ALA Tab 4, pp. 21, 30 (&ldquo;The IRSSA does not provide any express further rights of appeal or judicial review&rdquo; and &ldquo;Re-Review decisions are not reviewable by judicial review, as the IAP adjudicators are creatures of contract, not statute.&rdquo;)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is not a subject that requires the attention of this Court.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The limited availability of judicial recourse with respect to IAP decisions is well established</TI>
<P>49. The scope of judicial recourse under the IAP is a question of contractual interpretation, limited to this class action. <EM>Schachter</EM> was the first time that the Courts addressed the scope of judicial intervention permitted by the IRSSA. The Ontario Court of Appeal in that case found that that judicial recourse was available only in very exceptional or very limited circumstances &ldquo;where the final decision of the Chief Adjudicator reflects a failure to comply with the terms of the [IRSSA] or the implementation orders.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at paras. 53, 57</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Many cases have gone on to interpret and apply <EM>Schachter</EM>. The &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; set out at paragraph 42 of the applicant's memorandum of argument omits numerous significant court decisions.</P>
<P>50. In Alberta, the supervising judge, Justice Nation, has noted: &ldquo;So long as the adjudicator did not exceed his jurisdiction... his decision should stand... The IAP is established by the IRSSA and that agreement makes no provision for any appeal or review to this or any of the supervising courts of the decisions made in that process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 ABQB 225</CITE><PARANUM>53</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>51. In British Columbia, the Western Administrative Judge, Justice Brown, held, in what is known as the &ldquo;<EM>Bundled RFD</EM>&rdquo; decision in which five RFDs were heard at the same time:
<QUOTE><P>[7] In retrospect, it was distinctly advantageous to hear these five RFDs together. While each initially appeared to be distinct and exceptional (and while each has been determined on its own merits), when heard together it became difficult to distinguish them from ordinary appeals. That is the challenge in applying the test articulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight</SOC></CASEREF> and Schachter and determining whether the &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances&rdquo; warranting judicial recourse arise in these RFDs.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[177] ...<UNDER>I cannot accept that <EM>Schachter</EM> grounds a general &ldquo;curial review&rdquo; jurisdiction</UNDER>. In my view, the Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted that the parties to the IRSSA intended that access to the supervising judges be extraordinarily limited insofar as the IAP is concerned. I note that the phrase &ldquo;curial review&rdquo; does not even appear in <EM>Schachter</EM>. Moreover, the phrase &ldquo;curial review&rdquo; suggests a right to seek review before the Courts and a standard of review, both of which are untenable given the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <EM>Shachter</EM> [<EM>sic</EM>]. The preferable phrase&mdash;and concept&mdash;is judicial recourse. The Court of Appeal has explained that &ldquo;the right to seek judicial recourse is limited to very exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
<P>[178] <UNDER>There is good reason for this. Fundamentally, the IRSSA is a contract. The IAP is a negotiated process, and a complete code. To put it plainly, when the IAP Model was negotiated, the parties called &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; at re-review by the Chief Adjudicator or his or her delegate. The court must honour the parties' intentions.</UNDER> By limiting access to the courts, finality is preserved and the expertise of the Chief Adjudicator and those under his supervision is recognized.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[180] <UNDER>This principle of deference is even more imperative in this case. Despite my years of administering the IRSSA, it would be impossible for me to know better than those who have been immersed in the IAP since the IRSSA and with it, the IAP Model were implemented.</UNDER> This is plainly a setting where a deferential approach is both warranted and essential. The Courts are simply not well-placed to make findings of fact.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> at paras. 176&ndash;180 [emphasis added; footnotes omitted]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>52. The British Columbia Court of Appeal has also cited <EM>Schachter</EM> with approval, noting the Chief Adjudicator's &ldquo;broad discretion&rdquo; and &ldquo;relative expertise&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Merchant Law Group LLP</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 198</CITE></CASEREF>. The appellant has applied for leave to appeal in this court on an unrelated issue (S.C.C. File No. 37716)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. There have been three lower court decisions that have suggested a broader scope for judicial intervention, and they have now all been overruled. The first was Justice Schulman's decision in the <EM>Residents</EM> decision, which the Court of Appeal in the case at bar expressly declined to follow. In a 2015 decision, Justice Schulman himself seemed to have stepped-back from the wider jurisdiction he had exercised in <EM>Residents</EM>, stating:
<QUOTE><P>This proceeding is not an appeal from the decision of the designate, nor is it an Application for Judicial Review of the decision, nor is it an Application for a Declaration or interpretation of a statute, court order or agreement. None of those proceedings are available to a claimant or lawyer who acts for a claimant under the IRSSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al. v. AG Canada et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 MBQB 158</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. The second was Justice Perell's decision in the <EM>Spanish RFD SC</EM> case. This was overturned by a unanimous Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal cited extensively from Justice Brown's <EM>Bundled RFDs</EM> decision:
<QUOTE><P>[52] I disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that <EM>Schachter</EM> created a &ldquo;general curial jurisdiction&rdquo; in relation to the IAP. This court did not use that phrase and the entire thrust of the judgment is to the contrary. As Brown J. explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>177</PARANUM></CASEREF>: &ldquo;the phrase &lsquo;curial review&rsquo; suggests a right to seek review before the courts and a standard of review, both of which are untenable&rdquo; in the light of <EM>Schacher</EM> [<EM>sic</EM>].</P>
<P>[53] <EM>Schachter</EM> imposed strict limits on the scope for judicial intervention. It did so to respect the IRSSA, the contract the parties negotiated, of which the IAP is a fundamental part. As this court recognized in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 241 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>48</PARANUM></CASEREF>: &ldquo;[a]djudicators are specially trained to conduct the hearing in a way that is respectful to the claimant and conducive to obtaining a full description of his or her experience&rdquo;. The IAP has been aptly described as &ldquo;a complete code&rdquo; that limits access to the courts, preserves the finality of the IAP process and respects the expertise of IAP adjudicators: see <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>178</PARANUM></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spanish RFD CA</EM> at paras. 52-53</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. Perell J. has since cited <EM>Spanish RFD CA</EM> in noting the &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances&rdquo; required for judicial recourse and stating that there are now &ldquo;strong judgments directing the cour t to not intervene in the IAP process.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 2487</CITE><PARANUM>176, 182</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. Justice Brown has also, since the <EM>Spanish RFD CA</EM> decision, summarized the jurisprudence relating to the principles of judicial recourse:
<QUOTE><P>[65] <UNDER>The principles governing RFDs seeking judicial recourse from IAP decisions have been coalesced in a number of recent court decisions</UNDER>. These decisions are the progeny of the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight and Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 471</CITE></CASEREF>. <UNDER>They all reinforce the view that the IAP was intended by the parties to be a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo;. Allowing ready access to the courts for appeal or judicial review would seriously compromise the finality of the IAP and fail to pay appropriate heed to the expertise of IAP adjudicators. As such, judicial recourse is restricted to &ldquo;very exceptional&rdquo; cases, where the IAP decision in question reflects a &ldquo;patent disregard&rdquo; of the IAP Model.</UNDER></P>
<P>[66] At the risk of stating the obvious, this is a very onerous standard. This high threshold reflects at least two factors. The first is a realization of the jurisdictional limitations of the court when dealing with an IAP decision. As I noted in the so-called &ldquo;Bundled RFD&rdquo; decision, fundamentally, the IRSSA is a contract. <UNDER>It is outside of the purview of the court to create another level of review of these decisions that is not captured by the language of that agreement. The court must respect the parties' intention to create an adjudicative process with a sense of finality.</UNDER></P>
<P>[67] <UNDER>The second factor is a policy preference (that was formalized into the terms of IRSSA and the IAP process itself) for granting deference to the IAP Adjudicators.</UNDER> This policy is the same as that which encourages deference to trial judges and administrative tribunals. Simply put, these bodies which make decisions at first instance are best positioned to make certain determinations and have an expertise that a reviewing court may lack...</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[70] In the Spanish RFD case, the Ontario Court of Appeal provided further guidance on what constitutes &ldquo;patent disregard&rdquo;. As the Court noted, it is not permissible for the reviewing court to engage in a &ldquo;detailed review of the factual findings&rdquo;. <UNDER>Further, disagreeing with the conclusion of an IAP adjudicator does not justify judicial intervention.</UNDER> A high degree of deference must be accorded to these decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 946</CITE><PARANUM>65&ndash;70</PARANUM></CASEREF> [footnotes omitted; emphasis added.]; see also <EM>Double RFD</EM> at paras. 52&ndash;61 where Justice Brown again summarizes the jurisprudence, adopting <EM>Schachter, Spanish RFD CA</EM>, and the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision in the case at bar. One of the RFDs in the <EM>Double RFD</EM> decision also dealt with an argument that the adjudicator did not properly interpret SL1.4 in part because the adjudicator required &ldquo;sexual intent&rdquo; and improperly applied <CASEREF><SOC>R v. Chase</SOC></CASEREF>. Justice Brown dismissed the RFD, holding that the &ldquo;interpretative choices&rdquo; are entitled &ldquo;significant deference&rdquo;, that it was open for the adjudicators to consider <EM>Chase</EM> in interpreting SL1.4, and that ultimately there was no exceptional circumstance permitting the court to intervene.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>57. The only other decision which adopted a broader approach to judicial recourse was the decision of the Manitoba Queen's Bench in this case, in a decision that relied heavily on Justice Perell's now overturned decision in <EM>Spanish RFD SC</EM>.</P>
<P>58. Upon a review of the jurisprudence, it is clear that what has occurred is not a gradual &ldquo;narrowing of judicial supervision&rdquo; as the applicant contends.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Applicant's Memorandum of Argument at para. 42, ALA Tab 5, pp. 92-93</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, the jurisprudence has consistently held that judicial recourse is extremely narrow and only applies in very exceptional circumstances. Permitting a court to review and IAP decision for &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; offends the contract the settling parties created and is contrary to the policy preference of deferring to specialized and highly trained IAP adjudicators.</P>
<P>59. The jurisprudence has been consistent since the issue was first examined in depth in <EM>Schachter</EM>. The appellate authority (including the Court of Appeal in the case at bar) has appropriately limited the scope of court review as contemplated by the IRSSA. In British Columbia, the same result has been reached by the Supervising Court. There is no need for this Court to interfere with the established body of law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The alleged misapplication of the <EM>Schachter</EM> test is not a matter of public or national importance</TI>
<P>60. As an alternative, the applicant appears to argue that leave should be granted based on a misapplication of the appropriate test to the facts of this case. That assertion raises no question of public or national importance.</P>
<P>61. Moreover, it is important to remember that because of the advanced age of many IAP claimants, and the deeply painful experiences suffered by IAP claimants, the IAP was designed to be a <EM>sui generis</EM> and closed adjudication process that would provide expeditious and timely resolution of claims. The IAP is now almost complete.</P>
<P>62. If leave is granted, the tens of thousands of claimants across Canada who have completed their IAP claims will be put in considerable uncertainty about whether their claims are in fact complete. Claimants who were successful (of which almost 89% of those whose claims went to hearings before IAP adjudicators, or Negotiated Settlement Process interviews, are),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Double RFD</EM> at para. 22</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> will be left wondering whether their claims will be at risk of judicial intervention, given the potential for Canada and the Churches to seek the intervention of the courts. Those claimants who were not successful or entirely successful may also view the entire process as fundamentally unfair if a change in the law now would not change their ability to seek judicial recourse. In all cases, allowing leave to appeal would re-open wounds and a chapter in claimants' lives that they thought was closed.</P>
<P>63. Even from the very beginning, the large number of elderly class members and the need to secure expeditious justice was a significant concern. Justice Winkler in approving the IRSSA in <EM>Baxter</EM> noted, while discussing the jurisdiction of the supervisory courts, that &ldquo;time is of the essence&rdquo; due to the fact that class members were dying at a rate of 1,000 per year and that the death rate was expected to increase over time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Baxter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2006 CanLII 41673</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Chief Adjudicator submits that time continues to be of the essence. Granting leave to appeal represents a major step back and risks unraveling the entire IAP&mdash;a process which has been able to expeditiously resolve over 38,000 claims in a little over 10 years in large part because judicial recourse is very limited.</P>
<P>64. The public interest in putting the matter to rest lies not just in protecting the personal feelings of the claimants, but in the very ability of the IRSSA to achieve its broader purpose of healing and reconciliation and to compensate victims of the IRS system in a closed and expeditious manner.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>65. This appeal does not raise any serious question about the availability of judicial review of class action settlements generally. The only question is whether this particular contract, the IRSSA, permits recours e to the courts for a fourth level of review for reasonableness not provided for in the agreement itself. The Courts have consistently held that it does not.</P>
<P>66. The proposed appeal attempts to disturb this scheme and the jurisprudence limiting the courts' ability to intervene in the IAP process. Doing so is at odds with the public and national interest. It risks undermining the agreement the parties had made to create a closed, expeditious, out-of-court process to resolve IAP claims.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>JOINT REPLY MEMORANDUM OF ARGUMENT OF THE APPLICANTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This is the Applicants' joint reply to the Responses filed by the three Respondents: the Attorney General of Canada (&ldquo;Canada&rdquo;); the Assembly of First Nations (&ldquo;AFN&rdquo;); and The Chief Adjudicator.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">A. <UNDER>The IAP is an Administrative Tribunal</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. The Attorney General of Canada (&ldquo;Canada&rdquo;) and the Chief Adjudicator both say &ldquo;that the IAP is not an administrative tribunal&rdquo; (Canada Response, para. 15, Chief Adjudicator Response, para. 2). This is a surprising assertion inasmuch as former Chief Adjudicator Daniel Ish and the current website of the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat both characterize the IAP as an administrative tribunal.</P>
<P>3. In a document titled &ldquo;The Chief Adjudicator's Responsibility to Promote Consistency, Coherence and Quality in IAP Decisions&rdquo;, dated June 2009 (also quoted in the Chief Adjudicator's Response, at para. 24), and found on the Adjudication Secretariat's website, Chief Adjudicator Daniel Ish, as he then was, explained:
<QUOTE><P>The purpose of this document is to review the responsibility of the Chief Adjudicator to develop and implement mechanisms to promote coherence, consistency and quality in decisions rendered by adjudicators in the Independent Assessment Process. The IAP contemplates such a role for the Chief Adjudicator (CA) as do the principles of law applied to administrative tribunals, one of which the Settlement Agreement has created by providing for a cadre of adjudicators overseen by a Chief Adjudicator. As with other administrative tribunals, the IAP was &ldquo;created to increase the efficiency of the administration of justice and... called upon to handle heavy caseloads&rdquo;. (<CASEREF><SOC>IWA v. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1990 Can LII 132</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>).</P>
<P>This document will first outline the need for internal mechanisms, including internal review mechanisms, and the practice that has evolved within the IAP. It will also review the general principles of administrative law that are applicable to administrative tribunals in implementing internal mechanisms and making allowance for consultation by individual adjudicators with colleagues, legal counsel and staff.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;The Chief Adjudicator's Responsibility to Promote Consistency, Coherence and Quality in IAP Decisions&rdquo; (June 2009), found online at <UNDER>http://www.iappei.ca/media/information/publication/pdf/directives/gp-5-sch-a-eng.pdf</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
Throughout this paper, Chief Adjudicator Ish, as he then was, refers to the IAP as an &ldquo;administrative tribunal&rdquo;, and he applies general principles of administrative law to the IAP.</P>
<P>4. There are other references to the IAP as an administrative tribunal found currently on the Adjudication Secretariat's website. In his introduction to the Adjudication Secretariat's Annual Report of 2009, Chief Adjudicator Dan Ish, as he then was, again refers to the IAP as an administrative tribunal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat 2009 Annual Report&rdquo; (at pp. 3, 4 found online at <UNDER>http://www.iap-pei.ca/media/information/publication/pdf/pub/ar2009-eng.pdf</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, in an &ldquo;IAP Fact Sheet&rdquo; on the &ldquo;IAP and Self-Represented Claimants&rdquo;, dated March 2014 and found currently on the Adjudication Secretariat's website, the IAP is described as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The IAP is managed by the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat (IRSAS), an administrative tribunal which replaces the traditional court process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;IAP Fact Sheets: IAP and Self-Represented Claimants&rdquo; (March 2014), found <UNDER>www.iap-pei.ca/pub-eng.php?act=factsheets/self-represented-eng.php</UNDER></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>5. The Applicants say that the Chief Adjudicator and his website are correct to describe the IAP as an administrative tribunal. The Chief Adjudicator provides no explanation in his Response regarding the inconsistency in positions on whether the IAP is an administrative tribunal. However, it appears that both Canada and the Chief Adjudicator wish to deny the status of administrative tribunal to the IAP to bolster their position that judicial review of IAP decisions is unavailable.</P>
<P>6. Canada and The Chief Adjudicator repeatedly say that there is no right of appeal from a decision in the IAP to the courts. This is a red herring. The issue in this case is not whether there is a right of appeal to the courts, but whether judicial review of IAP decisions can be available to claimants denied the benefits of the IRRSA based upon unreasonable interpretations of its provisions.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">B. <UNDER>The IAP is a Creature of Statute, Agreement and Court Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Canada says that the IAP &ldquo;is a creature of a unique agreement, and not of a statute&rdquo; (Canada Response, para. 15). However, this formulation is, at best, imprecise. It is more accurate to say that the IAP is a hybrid creature of statute, court order, and agreement: The approval Orders by which the IRRSA was approved provide explicitly that the IRRSA is incorporated by reference into those Orders, and &ldquo;that the provisions of the applicable class proceedings law shall apply in their entirety to the supervision, operation and implementation of the Agreement and this judgment.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Semple et al v. The Attorney General of Canada et al</SOC></CASEREF>, Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Schulman, pronounced the 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of December, 2006 in Application for Leave to Appeal of the Applicants, J.W. and REO Law Corporation, dated August 28, 2017 [&ldquo;J.W. Application Record&rdquo;], Tab 6 at p. 101, paras. 12 and 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">C. <UNDER>The Inherent Jurisdiction of Superior Courts</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. There is no privative clause in the approval Orders, in the IRRSA, and in the <EM>The Class Proceedings Act</EM> of Manitoba which would purport to deny judicial review to claimants whose claims have been denied based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRRSA. Canada is unable to find significance in the absence of such a privative clause. Instead, Canada seems to take the position that judicial review would only be available if it is specifically provided for in the IRRSA (Canada Response at paras. 4 and 23). It is Canada's position that all of the provisions of the approval Orders and the <EM>Class Proceedings Act</EM> (Manitoba) which provide for the court's ongoing authority over the implementation and operation of the IRRSA do not establish that judicial review is available to claimants&mdash;even claimants who are denied the benefits of the Agreement they bargained for based upon manifestly irrational applications of that Agreement.</P>
<P>9. The rule of law that Canada is promoting in its Response seems to be that judicial review of administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions is unavailable unless explicitly provided for by the specific use of the words &ldquo;judicial review&rdquo; in the settlement agreement. Such a rule of law is completely unknown in the pre-IRRSA jurisprudence.</P>
<P>10. Moreover, as the AFN explains in its Response (at para. 49), such a general rule against judicial review would conflict with the fundamental basis of the law of judicial review in Canada, as articulated, for example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>&rdquo;]:
<QUOTE><P>Superior courts are, in the end, the protectors of the integrity of the rule of law and the justice system.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Dunsmuir</EM> at para. 159.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
To categorically deny the jurisdiction of the superior courts to hear judicial review applications from those who are, by unreasonable interpretations, denied the benefits of an agreement that those self-same courts approved is not only unjustified in view of the supervisory role that the courts reserved to themselves in approving the agreement, it contradicts the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts and their role as protectors of the integrity of the justice system.</P>
<P>11. This Court has recently confirmed the supervisory jurisdiction of superior courts over the implementation of the IRRSA in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 47</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;SCC Records Decision&rdquo;], noting that the supervising courts have &ldquo;a vital role&rdquo;, &ldquo;broad powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;must have generous discretion&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SCC Records Decision at paras. 31 and 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. The SCC Records Decision also grounds the supervisory courts' authority over the implementation of the IRRSA in the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts:
<QUOTE><P>Further, in any instance where the scope of superior courts' powers granted by class action legislation does not expressly contemplate certain supervisory functions, superior courts retain residual supervisory powers under their inherent jurisdiction. Removing the inherent jurisdiction of superior courts requires &ldquo;clear and precise statutory language&rdquo; (<CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Rose</SOC><CITE>[1998] 3 S.C.R. 262</CITE><PARANUM>133</PARANUM></CASEREF>; see also <EM>Endean</EM>, at paras. 24, 56 and 60).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SCC Records Decision at para. 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
The Applicants' position is that, even if the availability of judicial review cannot be grounded in the court Orders approving and implementing the IRRSA and/or the class proceedings statutes, it is nevertheless firmly grounded in the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts, which, as the Supreme Court has confirmed, has not been ousted by the settlement of the residential schools class action. The Applicants' view is that the ouster of the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts to review IAP decisions would have to occur by explicit terms ousting its jurisdiction and by the explicit approval of such terms by the superior courts themselves.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">D. <UNDER>The Schachter Rule Against Judicial Review</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. Canada and the Chief Adjudicator say that the rule that denies judicial review of administrative tribunals created by the settlement of class actions is well -established in the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Duboff Edwards Haight &amp; Schachter</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;<EM>Schachter</EM>&rdquo;]. The rule is set down there as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Judicial review is not available to review the exercise of authority by a judicially created body, which has been given certain duties as provided by the terms of the S.A. and the implementation orders. The office of the Chief Adjudicator was created by order of the courts in approving the negotiated terms of settlement of class action litigation. The authority of that office is exercised in relation to those class members who have elected to advance claims through the IAP and their counsel. The terms of the S. A. and the implementation orders set out the process for reviewing decisions of the IAP Adjudicators. Recourse to the courts is only available if it is provided for in the S. A. or the implementation orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para. 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
With respect, the Applicants reply that, in this passage of <EM>Schachter</EM>, the rule against judicial review is simply asserted, without the citation of any authority for the rule and without providing any persuasive reasoning for it.</P>
<P>14. Canada observes that the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in <EM>Schachter</EM> upheld the decision of Winkler CJO, the then Eastern Administrative Judge, who reasoned as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Judicial review may be available where a statutory power of decision has been exercised by an inferior tribunal, but a superior court does not judicially review its own order. Here, where the Chief Adjudicator is acting pursuant to a term of the orders issued by superior courts, he cannot be said to be exercising a statutory power of decision subject to judicial review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (AG)</SOC><JUDGDATE>7 March 2011</JUDGDATE><DOCKET>File No. 00-CV-192059CP</DOCKET><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Direction) at para. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
The reasoning here (also quoted in Canada's Response at para. 49 and the Chief Adjudicator's Response at para. 42) seems to be this: If a court were to conduct a judicial review of a decision in the IAP, it would, in effect, be reviewing its own approval and/or implementation Orders.</P>
<P>15. With respect, the Applicants say that an IAP decision which denies relief to a claimant based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA cannot be identified with the court Orders approving and implementing the IRRSA. To identify the court Orders with the IAP decisions is to collapse the critical distinction between them which is required for <UNDER>any</UNDER> supervisory role the superior courts may be said to have. Moreover, if the superior courts are to fulfill their purpose, per <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, of protecting the integrity of the justice system, they cannot be categorically prevented from reviewing the unreasonable decisions of administrative tribunals on the obscure premise that there is no distinction between their Orders and the decisions of those tribunals.</P>
<P>16. If the jurisprudential foundation and reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM> are, as the Applicant respectfully maintains, deficient, then it may be helpful to recall that <EM>Schachter</EM> can be sharply distinguished on the facts: The Applicant herein, J.W., was denied compensation in his IAP claim based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the IRRSA; whereas, the RFD in <EM>Schachter</EM> was made by a lawyer who thought he should receive more legal fees from his client in the IAP.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">E. <UNDER>The Post-<EM>Schachter</EM> Jurisprudence</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Part"><N><UNDER>I:</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>2012 to 2016&mdash;Court Review Continues</UNDER></TI>
<P>17. The Chief Adjudicator asserts that allowing judicial review of IAP decisions would cause &ldquo;profound uncertainty&rdquo; (Chief Adjudicator's Response, at para. 5). Canada submits that replacing the rule against judicial review in <EM>Schachter</EM> with the doctrine of judicial review would have the consequence of &ldquo;disrupting the integrity and finality of the IAP&rdquo; (Canada's Response, at para. 3).</P>
<P>18. The Chief Adjudicator and Canada greatly exaggerate the potential &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; that might be occasioned by the restoration of judicial review to IAP claimants. The IAP operated for several years without the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule against judicial review. There is no evidence of a flood of judicial review applications before that decision. Moreover, despite the rule in <EM>Schachter</EM>, for some time after that 2012 decision the supervising courts continued to exercise their proper supervisory jurisdiction to grant relief to claimants who were denied compensation based upon unreasonable interpretations of the IRRSA.</P>
<P>19. For example, in the 2014 decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 200</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Residents Decision&rdquo;], the then supervising judge of Manitoba interpreted the rule in <EM>Schachter</EM> as being consistent with his own jurisdiction to provide &ldquo;the court's assistance in assuring that the terms of the agreement [IRRSA] are not abrogated.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Residents Decision at para. 51</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Moreover, the potential &ldquo;abrogation&rdquo; at issue in that case involved a misinterpretation of the language if the IRRSA by which a claimant in the IAP had been denied compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at paras. 65 to 68.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. In applying the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule, the then supervising judge reasoned that the RFD process &ldquo;is not an appeal or a traditional judicial review of the Chief Adjudicator's decision, but rather a mechanism designed to ensure that the terms of the Settlement Agreement are properly implemented&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In conducting his non-traditional judicial review, the supervising judge then proceeded to establish reasonableness as the appropriate standard of review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at paras. 54 to 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Canada did not appeal the Resident's Decision.</P>
<P>21. In the 2016 decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 4326</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Spanish Decision&rdquo;], the supervising judge for Ontario acknowledged that the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule was binding on him and that it precluded judicial review in the usual sense. Nevertheless, he interpreted <EM>Schachter</EM> as nevertheless providing for a &ldquo;means to review the decisions of the Chief Adjudicator&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Spanish Decision at para. 43</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which he construed as &ldquo;a curial review jurisdiction&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para. 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. The 2016 decision of the Manitoba supervising judge in J.W.'s RFD falls within this line of post<EM>-Schachter</EM> cases, inasmuch the supervising judge for Manitoba determined that the form of court review available to IAP claimants is consistent with his determination of a standard review.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">F. <UNDER>The Post-<EM>Schachter</EM> Jurisprudence</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Part"><N><UNDER>II:</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>November 2016 to 2017&mdash;Closing the Door</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. In November of 2016, in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2218</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Bundled RFDs&rdquo;], the supervising judge for B.C. disagreed with the reasoning of the supervising judge of Ontario in the Spanish Decision:
<QUOTE><P>the phrase &ldquo;curial review&rdquo; suggests a right to seek review before the Courts and a standard of review, both of which are untenable given the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <EM>Shachter</EM> [<EM>sic</EM>].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bundled RFDs at para. 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
When the Spanish Decision was overturned in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 26</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Spanish Appeal&rdquo;], the Ontario Court of Appeal explicitly endorsed the B.C. supervising court's rejection of the reasoning of the Ontario supervising judge.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Spanish Appeal at para. 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. In comparison with the three post-<EM>Schachter</EM> decisions referenced above in the four years immediately following Schachter&mdash;in which a form or court review and the notion of a standard of review survived&mdash;the Ontario Court of Appeal's 2017 decision overturning the Spanish Decision represents a narrowing of the superior courts' supervisory jurisdiction. However, notwithstanding the rejection of the applicability of a &ldquo;standard of review&rdquo; to decisions in the IAP, the Ontario Court of Appeal referred favourably to the decision of the Manitoba supervising judge in the within appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Spanish Appeal at para. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. In reply to Canada's and the Chief Adjudicator's about the &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; of the post-<EM>Schachter</EM> jurisprudence (see the Chief Adjudicator's Response at para. 39 and Canada's Response at paras. 39 and 43), the Applicants say that, in fact, the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal closes the door to the supervising courts even more, with a construal of the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule that seems to confine &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; to a species of procedural unfairness whereby the adjudicator categorically fails to apply the applicable law. This narrowly defined recourse is hard to reconcile with the reasoning in <EM>Schachter</EM> that &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; is meant &ldquo;to ensure that the bargain to which they consented is respected&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Schachter</EM> at para. 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P>
<P>26. In fact, it appears that in argument before the B.C. supervising court recently, Canada acknowledge that the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision in J.W.'s case modifies <EM>Schachter</EM>, as explained in the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1633</CITE></CASEREF> [&ldquo;Bundled RFDs #3&rdquo;]:
<QUOTE><P>Canada agreed that in <EM>Reo</EM>, the Manitoba Court of Appeal appears to have modified the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold by narrowing the circumstances in which judicial recourse is available. Canada urged this court to adopt this modified standard and to conclude that neither Requestor met the standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bundled RFDs #3 at para. 63.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE>
The B.C. supervising judge reasoned that it was not necessary, in the case before her, to determine whether the MCA's decision narrowed the <EM>Schachter</EM> threshold; however, she acknowledged &ldquo;it is arguable in <EM>Reo</EM>, the Manitoba Court of Appeal reformulated the <BOLD><EM>Schachter</EM></BOLD> threshold, narrowing the circumstances in which judicial recourse can be invoked&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Bundled RFDs #3 at para. 64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VII">G. <UNDER>The Court of Appeal Failed to Show Deference to the Supervising Judge</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. In its Response (at paras. 34 to 39), Canada explains that, in J.W.'s case, the Manitoba Court of Appeal applied the rule in <EM>Schachter</EM> to overturn the supervising judge's decision. The supervising judge had applied the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule, but the Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that the supervising judge was mistaken in concluding that the use of an egregious misinterpretation of the Compensation Rules to deny a sexual abuse claim is tantamount to failing to apply the IRRSA.</P>
<P>28. In Reply, the Applicants observe that, in the SCC Records Decision, this Court set down a deferential standard for appellate court reviews of the decisions of supervising judges:
<QUOTE><P>As for the supervising judge's decision to order destruction of the IAP Documents held by Canada following a 15-year retention period, a deferential standard is also appropriate. As explained above, supervisory courts have wide discretion to make appropriate orders to ensure the fair and expeditious determination of class proceedings. Such decisions are afforded deference on review (<CASEREF><SOC>Lavier v. MyTravel Canada Holidays Inc.</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 92</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>359 D.L.R. (4th) 713</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>). As regards the exercise of discretion, &ldquo;[a]ppellate intervention is warranted only if the judge has clearly misdirected himself or herself on the facts or the law, proceeded arbitrarily, or if the decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice&rdquo; (<CASEREF><SOC>P. (W.) v. Alberta</SOC><CITE>2014 ABCA 404</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>378 D.L.R. (4th) 629</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Balogun v. Pandher</SOC><CITE>2010 ABCA 40</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>474 A.R. 258</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>). As this Court has said, where the judge at first instance has given sufficient weight to all relevant considerations and the exercise of discretion is not based on an erroneous principle, appellate reviewers must generally defer (<CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Green</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 60</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2015] 3 S.C.R. 801</CITE><PARANUM>95</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Reza v.

<P>29. The <EM>Schachter</EM> decision was not binding on the Manitoba supervising judge in the within case. Nevertheless, the supervising judge in Manitoba considered the <EM>Schachter</EM> rule that &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; is available when an adjudicator fails to comply with the terms IRRSA. In the supervising judge's view, a misinterpretation of the IRRSA can be so unreasonable that it constitutes a failure to comply with the terms of IRRSA. He concluded that that is what occurred in the adjudication of J.W.'s claim.</P>
<P>30. The Applicants submit it was within the discretion of the supervising judge to interpret the Schachter rule thusly. By substituting its own interpretation of the non-binding <EM>Schachter</EM> rule for the interpretation of the supervising judge, and thereby overturning the supervising judge's decision, the Manitoba Court of Appeal failed to show the deference that should have been accorded to the supervising judge.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VIII">H. <UNDER>The MCA's Misapplication of Schachter is an Issue of National Importance</UNDER></TI>
<P>31. In his Response (at para. 60), the Chief Adjudicator asserts that the issue of whether the Manitoba Court of Appeal misapplied <EM>Schachter</EM> &ldquo;raises no question of public or national importance&rdquo;. The Applicants reply that, if the MCA's holding that adjudicators may deny IAP claims based upon irrational interpretations of the IRRSA without claimants having any judicial recourse is inconsistent with <EM>Schachter</EM>, then this is a matter of importance not only to IAP claimants who have, and who may yet have their claims denied based upon such irrational interpretations, but also to the superior courts tasked with supervising the IAP. The IAP is a significant feature of the project of reconciliation. The integrity of the IAP is a matter of national importance.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>32. In its Response (at para. 69), Canada refers to the &ldquo;hard deadlines&rdquo; imposed for applications for &ldquo;judicial recourse&rdquo; by the Western Administrative Judge in the Bundled RFDs decision of November 2016. The Applicants view is that this deadline was not agreed to by the parties to the IRRSA, is not reflected in the approval or implementation Orders of the supervising courts, has no basis in the previous jurisprudence of the supervising courts and was not observed in practice prior to that decision. However, even if the &ldquo;hard deadline&rdquo; is valid, there are nevertheless many claimants for whom this &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; has not yet passed.</P>
<P>33. The Applicants have argued that Canada and the Chief Adjudicator make exaggerated claims about the &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; and &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; that revisiting <EM>Schachter</EM> might occasion. At times, the &ldquo;finality&rdquo; Canada speaks of seems prompted by the desire to see the IAP come to an end. The Applicants say that a &ldquo;finality&rdquo; premised upon the denial of justice to residential school survivors is undesirable.</P>
