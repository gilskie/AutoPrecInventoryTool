<P>1. Daniel Forsyth is a resident of the Halifax Regional Municipality.</P>
<P>2. The defendant, Halifax Regional Municipality, is a body corporate and a municipality in the Province of Nova Scotia, and is and was at all material times hereto responsible for and had control over the construction, maintenance, upkeep, and safety of sidewalks located within the Halifax Regional Municipality, including responsibility for and oversight of street signs, parking signs, and/or bus signs located on the sidewalks.</P>
<P>3. The plaintiff states that on April 14, 2015, he had been visiting his father in the Veterans Memorial Hospital in the Halifax Regional Municipality. At the time of his visit, for certain medical reasons, the plaintiff was using a wheelchair.</P>
<P>4. The plaintiff states that following the conclusion of his visit, he exited the Veterans Memorial Hospital and entered onto a street known as Veterans Memorial Lane located immediately adjacent to the Hospital building.</P>
<P>5. The plaintiff states that upon exiting the building, he made his way to the sidewalk on the south side of Veterans Memorial Lane. He then began to proceed in an easterly direction on Veterans Memorial Lane, moving towards the intersection of Veterans Memorial Lane and Summer Street.</P>
<P>6. The plaintiff states that on April 14, 2015, there was snow on the ground but it was not snowing that day. There was an accumulation of snow on the sidewalk on which the plaintiff was travelling. The accumulation was such that there were banks of snow on each edge of the sidewalk, creating a limited lane of travel for the plaintiff in his wheelchair.</P>
<P>7. The plaintiff states that his wheelchair is powered by a motor. As the plaintiff was operating his wheelchair along Veterans Memorial Lane, it struck an object causing the wheelchair to tip and throwing the plaintiff from the wheelchair.</P>
<P>8. The plaintiff states that the object which he struck was the remains of a traffic or bus sign which had been broken or otherwise sawed off. The remains of the post extended between 3&ndash;6 inches from the sidewalk. The post was not visible at the time due to the snow accumulation.</P>
<P>9. The plaintiff states that there were no signs or indicators as to the presence of the broken post protruding from the sidewalk.</P>
<P>10. The plaintiff relies upon the applicable provisions of the <EM>Municipal Government Act</EM>, S.N.S. 1998, c.18.</P>
<P>11. As a result of the accident described above, the plaintiff sustained bodily injuries and damages.</P>
<P>12. The plaintiff states that the accident and resulting injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant, it's employees or agents. Particulars of the negligence include:
<P1>a) Failure to maintain the sidewalk in a safe and prudent manner;</P1>
<P1>b) Allowing the remains of the traffic pole to stay in the sidewalk when the defendant, its employees or agents knew or ought to have known the presence of the partial pole posed a danger to the users of the sidewalk;</P1>
<P1>c) Failure to adhere to applicable policies regarding the maintenance and safety of the sidewalk;</P1>
<P1>d) failure to place any or adequate warnings or cautions to users of the sidewalk regarding the presence of the remains of the pole, when the defendant, it's employees or agents knew or ought to have known that the pole presented a potential danger to users of the sidewalk; and</P1>
<P1>e) such other negligence as may appear.</P1></P>
<P>12. The plaintiff repeats the foregoing and claims against the defendant for the following:
<P1>a) General damages;</P1>
<P1>b) Special Damages, particulars of which will be delivered at or before at trial;</P1>
<P1>c) Loss of Housekeeping Capacity;</P1>
<P1>d) Costs;</P1>
<P1>e) Pre-judgement Interest; and</P1>
<P1>f) Such other damages as this honourable court deems fit to award.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF DANIEL FORSYTH Sworn on March 15 2017</TI>
<P>I, Daniel Forsyth, of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, make oath and say as follows:</P>
<P>1. I am the Plaintiff in this proceeding.</P>
<P>2. I have personal knowledge of the evidence sworn to in this affidavit except where otherwise stated to be based on information and belief.</P>
<P>3. I state, in this affidavit, the source of any information that is not based on my own personal knowledge, and state my belief of the source.</P>
<P>4. As a result of injuries sustained in an accident in 2006, I require the use of a wheelchair because the injuries sustained resulted in paraplegia.</P>
<P>5. On April 16, 2015 I was visiting my father. He was a patient at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre.</P>
<P>6. After finishing my visit I exited from the hospital. It was my intention to travel to Spring Garden Road in order to get a bus to return to my home in Dartmouth.</P>
<P>7. Upon exiting the hospital I travelled along the sidewalk of Veterans Memorial Way. My direction of travel was taking me towards Summer Street. The sidewalk is somewhat at a down hill angle as one moves towards Summer Street.</P>
<P>8. There were snow banks on either side of the sidewalk. There was a slight layer of snow on the main travelled portions of the sidewalk.</P>
<P>9. As I progressed towards Summer Street my wheelchair struck something and I was thrown from the wheelchair. I did not and could not see the object that I struck prior to hitting it as it was obscured by the snow.</P>
<P>10. After the accident I realized that the object which I struck was the remnants of a traffic sign which had been broken.</P>
<P>11. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a copy of the Emergency Health Services report dated April 16, 2015. The report includes details with respect to the accident and certain symptoms I was experiencing immediately following the fall.</P>
<P>12. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; is a copy of a X-ray report dated April 16, 2015. The report indicates that as a result of the fall, I sustained comminuted fractures of my distal femur, proximal tibia and fibula.</P>
<P>13. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; is a further X-ray report dated October 7, 2015.</P>
<P>14. Between the injuries sustained in 2006 and those sustained as a result of the fall on April 16, 2015, I had other injuries and medical issues. These include medication addiction issues and other physical injuries.</P>
<P>15. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; is a copy of a report from Dr. John Fraser to Wawanesa Insurance. Dr. Fraser was asked to write a report in relation to injuries I sustained in a motor vehicle accident on January 20, 2013. Dr. Fraser's report addresses matters arising out of my addiction issues, as well as issues arising out of the January 20, 2013 motor vehicle accident. A claim was made as a result of the January 20, 2013 accident and has now been resolved.</P>
<P>16. Since the April 16, 2015 accident I have had other injuries. These include injuries to my ankle and right leg. Attached as Exhibits &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; respectively are copies of an Ambulatory Care Clinic letter written by Dr. Nathan Urquhart on November 16, 2015 and a CT scan report dated March 25, 2016.</P>
<P>17. Through my counsel, Peter Rumscheidt, Stanley Consulting Services was retained to prepare a cost of future care and loss of valuable services life care plan report in support of my claim for compensation in the within proceeding. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; is a copy of the March 18, 2016 report of Stanley Consulting Services.</P>
<P>18. The Notice of Action and Statement of Claim in this matter was filed with the Court on October 5, 2015. The Notice of Defence on behalf of the Defendant was filed on November 16, 2015.</P>
<P>19. I have provided to the Defendant an original Affidavit Disclosing Documents as well as two Supplemental Affidavits Disclosing Documents. These Affidavits include a very large volume of medical records from both before and after the April 16, 2015 accident. The Defendant has provided its original Affidavit Disclosing Documents as well as a Supplementary Affidavit Disclosing Affidavits.</P>
<P>20. Discovery examinations of me and a representative of the Defendant took place on October 27, 2016.</P>
<P>21. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that on December 5, 2016 he filed with the Court a Request for Date Assignment Conference. I am further advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that on December 13, 2016 the Defendant filed its Memorandum for Date Assignment Judge.</P>
<P>22. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that a Date Assignment Conference call was scheduled for March 3, 2017.</P>
<P>23. Following review with Mr. Rumscheidt, I provided him with instructions to explore with counsel for the Defendant whether the Defendant would consent to conducting a trial of the liability question in this matter separate from a trial with respect to the damages question. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that counsel for the Defendant advised her client was not prepared to consent to such an agreement.</P>
<P>24. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; is a copy of correspondence from my counsel to the Scheduling Office of this Court dated February 27, 2017.</P>
<P>25. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that in response to his February 27, 2017 letter, the Court advised that the issue of whether the matters of liability and damages should be tried at a separate time would need to be the subject matter of a formal motion to the Court.</P>
<P>26. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a copy of an email from Matthew Dunn dated May 5, 2016 addressed to Roxanne Maclaurin and Desmond Munden (&ldquo;Mr. Munden&rdquo;).</P>
<P>27. Mr. Munden was the representative of the Defendant who was discovered by Mr. Rumscheidt on October 27, 2016.</P>
<P>28. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that during the course of Mr. Munden's discovery examination he confirmed that the contents of Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; represent the results of the Defendant's investigation into the April 16, 2015 incident.</P>
<P>29. Among the conclusions reached in the investigation summary was the location of the broken traffic post which I struck on April 16, 2015. I accept as accurate that conclusion.</P>
<P>30. One of the other conclusions reached in the investigation summary was that a broken sign which had been responded to prior to my accident by employees of the Defendant was different from the sign involved in my incident. I accept as accurate that conclusion.</P>
<P>31. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is an extract from the discovery transcript for Mr. Munden. The extract includes Mr. Munden's evidence that having reviewed all of the circumstances, the Defendant's conclusion is that the post involved in my accident was knocked over by snow plowing efforts at some point between August 2014 and the date of my accident.</P>
<P>32. I am advised by Mr. Rumscheidt and believe that he has received confirmation from counsel for the Defendant that at all relevant times, snow clearing efforts on Veterans Memorial Way were undertaken by employees of the Defendant.</P>
<P>33. Based on communications with Mr. Rumscheidt, I strongly expect that, in support of my claim for damages, I will be retaining at least one and perhaps two additional experts f or purposes of preparing reports. In particular, it is anticipated that an expert in orthopaedics and/or an expert in physical medical and rehabilitation may be retained.</P>
<P>34. Given the on-going medical issues I face as a result of the 2006 accident as well as matters that have arisen since, including the April 14, 2015 accident, I anticipate I may be limited with respect to how long I could stay in the witness stand to given evidence at a trial. I anticipate that I may need more frequent breaks than might be the normal procedure.</P>

<P>September 4, 2018</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>MOTION</TI>
<P>I represent the Defendant Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in this matter. The Plaintiff Daniel Forsyth seeks a pre-trial ruling on the following:
<P1>(a) When Desmond Munden gave discovery evidence on October 27, 2016, did he do so as the designated manager of the Defendant; and</P1>
<P1>(b) The extent to which the discovery evidence given by Desmond Munden is binding on the Defendant at trial. The Plaintiff brings this motion pursuant to Rules 12, 14.14, 18.02 and 18.20.</P1></P>
<P>If Mr. Munden testified as a designated manager his discovery evidence can be used at trial for all purposes under Rule 18.20(2). If he testified as an employee then Rule 18.20(3) applies.</P>
<P>HRM submits that in the circumstances of this case there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Munden was a &ldquo;designated manager&rdquo; under Rule 14.14 or Rule 18.20(2). HRM further submits that part (b) of the Plaintiff's motion involves evidentiary findings and is outside the ambit of Rule 12.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>There is no disagreement regarding the exchange of communications between the Counsel leading up to the discovery of Mr. Munden. Mr. Rumscheidt in correspondence dated November 17, 2015, was clear that he wanted to <BOLD>&ldquo;discover a representative of HRM. To the extent possible, please forward a representative who can address the general policies of HRM regarding sidewalk maintenance and signage as well as the background or history with respect to the removal of any signage on the street in question&rdquo;.</BOLD> A copy of Mr. Rumscheidt's correspondence is attached to the Affidavit of Joel Plater as Exhibit B.</P>
<P>Via e-mail dated August 30, 2016 (Exhibit C of Joel Plater's Affidavit), Mr. Rumscheidt was advised that HRM's witness would be Desmond Munden, Works Supervisor with Traffic Management Transportation and Public Works.</P>
<P>At no time prior to the discovery did the Plaintiff indicate that he was seeking to discover a &ldquo;designated manager&rdquo; under Rule 14.14 or 18.20(2). The Plaintiff simply stated that he was seeking to discover a representative of HRM for the purposes set out in the November 17, 2015, correspondence. At no time did the Defendant indicate that it was advancing a designated manager under Rule 14.14 or Rule 18.20(2).</P>
<P>Rule 14.14 often has little bearing on litigation involving the Municipality. Witnesses are put forward as employees unless a specific request is made for the discovery of a designated manager. Most litigation against the Municipality involves claims for personal injury. These sorts of claims very seldom lend themselves to the need to discover a designated manager. For example, in a case involving a motor vehicle accident the driver of the HRM vehicle would be discovered as a fact witness, as would a police officer involved in a case claiming excessive use of force or wrongful arrest. Employee witnesses can speak directly to the facts within their knowledge and matters within the scope of their employment duties.</P>
<P>In this case, Mr. Munden was the HRM employee who was responsible for service requests relating to fixing/repairing road signage within the Municipality. Mr. Munden describes his job duties at pages 7 and 8 of the discovery transcript. As a Works Supervisor, Mr. Munden was the employee who could best address the general policies of HRM regarding signage as well as the background or history with respect to the removal of any signage on the street in question. He was produced in response to the specific request made by the Plaintiff, not as a designated manager under Rule 14.14 or Rule 18.20(2).</P>
<P>Mr. Munden testified at discovery that his duties as a Works Supervisor involved managing services requests for fixing/repairing road signage. The witness was not asked if he had authority as a Works Supervisor to bind HRM with his subjective opinions or personal views, or if he was authorized to speak to matters outside of his job description. It is doubtful that Mr. Munden even understood what a designated manager was.</P>
<P>HRM submits that the exchange between Mr. Rumscheidt and Mr. Harfouche at the commencement of the discovery is not determinative of the matter. Neither party referred to Mr. Munden as the designated manager. The brief exchange between Counsel cannot be viewed in a vacuum without reference to the correspondence which set out the parameters for the discovery. There is no direct evidence from the witness that he was a designated manager of the Defendant; to the contrary, the witness was clear as to what his job duties entailed.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Rule 12</TI>
<P>Rule 12 authorizes a determination of only an issue of law. Under Rule 12.01(1) a party may in <BOLD>limited circumstances</BOLD>, seek the determination of a question of law before the rest of the issues in a proceeding are determined, even though the parties disagree about facts relevant to the question.</P>
<P>Rule 12.02 sets out in what limited circumstances the court may separate a question of law from other issues in a proceeding and provide for its determination before the trial. Under the Rule, a judge may only do so if all of the following apply:
<P1>(a) The facts necessary to determine the question can be found without the trial or hearing;</P1>
<P1>(b) The determination will reduce the length of the proceeding, duration of the trial or hearing, or expense of the proceeding;</P1>
<P1>(c) No facts to be found in order to answer the question will remain in issue after the determination.</P1></P>
<P>In <CASEREF><SOC>Mahoney v. Cumis Life Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2011 NSCA 31</CITE></CASEREF> (Tab # 1) the ambit of the Rule 12 was discussed by Justice Fichaud at paragraphs 18, 19, 20, and 21 as follows:
<QUOTE><P>18 So the first step with Rule 12 is to identify the pure legal question to be determined. Rule 12.01(1) permits a motion for determination of &ldquo;a question of law&rdquo;. Rule 12.03(1) permits the judge either to determine &ldquo;the question of law&rdquo; or appoint a time to determine that question of law. The Rule does not authorize a determination of a question of fact or mixed fact and law, excepting only those facts that scaffold the point of pure law under Rule 12.02(a) as I have discussed.</P>
<P>19 The second step is to identify all the facts that are necessary to determine that question of pure law. Nothing in Rule 12 permits a judge to decide facts that are unnecessary to determine the question of pure law in the motion. A party who wishes an assessment of evidence on other matters, leading to a judgment by interlocutory ruling, should make or join a summary judgment motion under Rule 13.04 (&ldquo;Summary judgment on evidence&rdquo;).</P>
<P>20 The third step under Rule 12 is to decide whether all those facts necessary to determine the issue of pure law in the motion &ldquo;can be found without the trial or hearing&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21 This third step generates the question&mdash;What does Rule 12.02(a) mean that those facts &ldquo;can be found without the trial or hearing&rdquo;? In my view, it does not mean that a judge under Rule 12 can assess evidence in the same fashion as in a motion for summary judgment on the evidence under Rule 13.04. Under Rule 13.04, a responding party must &ldquo;put his best foot forward&rdquo; with evidence or risk a determination that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring trial, or that its claim or defence has no real chance of success, and a consequent dismissal of the action or defence: <CASEREF><SOC>Aylward v. Dalhousie University</SOC><CITE>2011 NSCA 20</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF>, affirming <CASEREF><SOC>Dalhousie University v. Aylward</SOC><CITE>2010 NSSC 65</CITE><PARANUM>20&ndash;25</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Ristow v. National Bank Financial Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2010 NSCA 79</CITE><PARANUM>5&ndash;9</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Brill</SOC><CITE>2010 NSCA 69</CITE><PARANUM>173</PARANUM></CASEREF>. Rule 12 does not give the chambers judge that power. A judge under Rule 12 <BOLD>may not determine contested facts</BOLD> that might hinge on testimony at a trial. That is the point of Rule 12.02(a)'s condition that &ldquo;the facts ... can be found without the trial&rdquo;. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>On the first step, HRM submits that whether Rule 18.20(2) or 18.20(3) applies is a pure &ldquo;question of law&rdquo;.</P>
<P>On the second step, whether or not Mr. Munden was the designated manager of the Defendant at the time of his discovery requires a finding of fact. HRM submits that the facts that are necessary to determine the question of law in this case are as follows:
<P1>1. Did the Defendant provide formal notification under Rule 14.14 that Desmond Munden was its designated manager?</P1>
<P1>2. Prior to discovery, did the Plaintiff make a request to discover the designated manager of the Defendant?</P1>
<P1>3. Prior to discovery did the Defendant communicate to the Plaintiff that Mr. Munden was being advanced for discovery as the designated manager of the Defendant?</P1>
<P1>4. At discovery, did Mr. Munden testify that he was the designated manager of the Defendant?</P1>
<P1>5. Was Mr. Munden asked any questions regarding the scope of his authority to bind the Defendant?</P1>
<P1>6. What were Mr. Munden's job duties?</P1></P>
<P>On the third step, HRM submits that the facts necessary to determine the issue of pure law in the motion can be found without the trial or hearing. The essential facts necessary to make a determination as to whether Mr. Munden was the designated manager of HRM do not appear to be in dispute. The Plaintiff agrees that no designated manager was identified under Rule 14.14 and that he did not make a request to discovery a designated manager. At no time did the Defendant indicate that Mr. Munden was its designated manager. Mr. Munden did not testify at discovery that he was a designated manager, nor was he asked any questions about his authority to bind HRM. The exchange between Counsel prior to discovery did not make any reference to a designated manager. Mr. Munden described his job duties which involved managing service requests for fixing/repairing road signage. It does not appear that any of the above facts are in dispute.</P>
<P>I note that our Court has dealt with a similar issue on a pre-trial motion. For example, the purpose to which discovery evidence could be used at trial was the subject of an application in <CASEREF><SOC>Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Co. of Canada</SOC><CITE>[2005] NSJ No. 223</CITE></CASEREF> (Tab # 2). In that case, the Court needed to decide whether the Minister of Justice was an officer, director or manager of a party that is a corporation such that his discovery evidence could be used under Rule 18.14(1)(b) [new Rule 18.20(2)] for all purposes. Justice Moir dealt with the matter on a Rule 25 motion [new Rule 12] as he found that the assessment of the application engaged evidence that was &ldquo;so uncontentious that all material facts necessary to answer the question could be determined easily without a trial&rdquo;. In that case, the Minister of Justice was found to be an officer of the Crown.</P>
<P>The Plaintiff in correspondence dated November 17, 2015, made a request for a specific witness. The witness who best fulfilled the Plaintiff's requirements was produced for discovery. Mr. Munden described his job duties with the Municipality. His description of his role with the Municipality could in no way lead to the conclusion that he was the designated manager of the Defendant.</P>
<P>Mr. Harfouche attended at the discovery on behalf of the Defendant. He was not solicitor of record. Prior to the commencement of the discovery Mr. Harfouche confirmed that Mr. Munden was a representative of the Defendant and that his answers would bind the municipality. Rule 18.20(3) sets a limit on the use of a discovery transcript where a deponent is an employee. Under the Rule, Mr. Munden's is only able to bind the municipality with respect to matters within the scope his authority. In HRM's view the exchange between Mr. Rumscheidt and Mr. Harfouche at the commencement of the discovery did not elevate Mr. Munden from an employee in charge of managing service requests for fixing/repairing road signage to that of a designated manager.</P>
<P>HRM respectfully submits that in the circumstances of this case, Rule 18.02(3) is applicable in that evidence given by an officer or employee of a corporate party who is not a designated manager may be used for any purpose by an adverse party, except answers outside the witnesses' scope of authority are not admissions by the corporate party.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Findings of Fact Outside the Ambit of Rule 12</TI>
<P>HRM submits that the only question that can be answered on this motion is which Rule applies to Mr. Munden's discovery evidence. Part (b) of the Plaintiff's motion cannot properly be dealt with under Rule 12 as the facts necessary to determine the question cannot be found without the trial. Whether something Mr. Munden said at discovery was an admission, or admissible under the rules of evidence or within his authority (where Rule 18.20(3) applies) is a matter for the trial judge. Furthermore, the admission of discovery evidence at trial is subject to relevancy, weight and questions of admissibility.</P>
<P>Mr. Dunn, who authored the e-mail put to Mr. Munden, will be required to testify about his investigations and the basis for his &ldquo;presumptions&rdquo;. Determinations will be required to be made regarding the admissibility of the presumptions contained in the e-mail and whether those presumptions were accepted as conclusions by HRM or simply remained as the personal presumptions and opinions of the author of the e-mail. The extent of Mr. Munden's authority relating to the acceptance of presumptions on behalf his employer will likewise be in issue.</P>
<P>There will be no reduction in the length of the trial or hearing as it is highly likely that both Mr. Munden and Mr. Dunn will be required for trial. Facts will still remain in issue, such as the scope of Mr. Munden's authority and the qualifications of both Mr. Dunn and Mr. Munden to provide opinion evidence on sign post markings.</P>
<P>As set out in his brief, the Plaintiff is seeking a ruling that several admissions which he says were made by Mr. Munden on discovery are binding on HRM at trial.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI>The location of the remnants of which post Mr. Forsyth struck with his wheel chair.</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff says that his claim relates to the sign post that is located closest to the intersection of Veteran's Memorial Way with Summer Street. No one from HRM witnessed the Plaintiff's mishap. The Plaintiff's evidence regarding the location and the reason for his fall is just that: the Plaintiff's evidence. Whether or not the Plaintiff struck the remnants of the post at this location is a finding for the trial judge.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI>That the post in question had been knocked over as a result of snow plowing work.</TI>
<P>This HRM submits is the main reason for this motion in that the Plaintiff is seeking to bind HRM to what he says is an admission that the post was struck and knocked down by an HRM snow plow.</P>
<P>At page 28 of the discovery transcript Mr. Rumscheidt posed the following question to Mr. Munden while directing him to Matthew Dunn's e-mail of May 5, 2016:
<QUOTE><P>Q. Right. And again, read this if you need to but my&mdash;I take it the conclusion, or the assumption that HRM came to was that Post No. 1, that's what Mr. Dunn calls it&mdash;the closest to Summer Street that was involved in Mr. Forsyth's accident&mdash;that in all likelihood that the post had been knocked over or broken as a result of snow plowing efforts. Is that what&mdash;the conclusion HRM reached.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Nowhere in Mr. Dunn's e-mail does he suggest that in all likelihood the post had been knocked over or broken as a result of snow plowing efforts. He simply says that &ldquo;one would presume it had been knocked over by snow clearing vehicles&rdquo;. Mr. Rumscheidt also incorrectly suggests to Mr. Munden that Mr. Dunn's &ldquo;conclusion, or assumption&rdquo; was the conclusion or assumption of HRM.</P>
<P>Even though Mr. Dunn is clear in his e-mail that he is simply &ldquo;presuming&rdquo; Mr. Rumscheidt goes on to suggest to the witness that the conclusion HRM has come to is that the sign got knocked over by snow plowing efforts. Mr. Munden simply agrees with Mr. Rumscheidt. Regardless, whether Mr. Munden agrees with Mr. Rumscheidt's interpretation of Mr. Dunn's e-mail, the email speaks for itself&mdash;Mr. Dunn made an assumption. He did not draw any definitive conclusions about how the sign post was knocked down nor would he have the qualifications to do so.</P>
<P>HRM witnesses will testify at trial that posts become detached in all seasons for assorted reasons including storm damage, rust, and impact with vehicles. The only way HRM would have a clear understanding of how a post came to be knocked down is if someone included that information in a report. For example, a police officer or a citizen may have direct knowledge of a post having been knocked down by an MVA. The main concern of HRM is the repair of damaged signs, not forensic investigation into the cause of the failure.</P>
<P>Later during the discovery at page 32 Mr. Rumscheidt asks Mr. Munden whether he agrees that the photos attached to Mr. Dunn's e-mail show snow removal damage along the side of post 1. Mr. Munden's response is &ldquo;yes, correct&rdquo;. At this point, however, Mr. Rumscheidt had already incorrectly suggested to Mr. Munden that Mr. Dunn was speaking on behalf of HRM and that HRM had concluded that the sign got knocked over by snow plowing efforts. This, is simply an incorrect interpretation of Mr. Dunn's e-mail which was the focus of all the questions put to Mr. Munden relating to the markings on the post.</P>
<P>Neither Mr. Munden at discovery, or Mr. Dunn in his e-mail, made any reference to the post having been knocked down by an HRM employee or an HRM snow plow. The post has been in its current position since at least 1991. It would not be possible to tell from a visual inspection of the post or an inspection of a photograph of the post (which Mr. Munden was asked to do on discovery) to make any determination as to when any of the marks on the post were made let alone whether the marks were made by an HRM plow driven by an HRM employee in 2014/2015.</P>
<P>Neither Mr. Munden or Mr. Dunn have sufficient personal knowledge to answer the question regarding the marks on the post. The testimony regarding the markings of the post is inadmissible opinion. Opinion evidence of this sort would require scientific or technical expertise whereas Mr. Dunn was merely speculating and Mr. Munden merely agreeing with Mr. Dunn's inadmissible speculations. Furthermore, in HRM's view, the questions put to Mr. Munden misstated or misrepresented the contents of Mr. Dunn's e-mail and as such, the responses are of little or value to the determination of the issues at trial.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>3.</N><TI>That the post was knocked over at some point in time between August 2014 and the April 16, 2015 accident.</TI>
<P>Based on historical data from Google Earth, it appears that the post which was closest to Veteran's Memorial Way was severed from its base sometime between August 2014, and April 16, 2015. HRM cannot speak to the accuracy of the Google Map data. HRM had no knowledge of the downed post prior to the Plaintiff's fall.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>4.</N><TI>That the post was repaired at some point between Mr. Forsyth's accident and October 23, 2015.</TI>
<P>HRM employees will testify at trial about repairs to posts along Veteran's Memorial Way. A photograph taken on October 23, 2015, shows the post back in its proper location. What posts were repaired and when the repairs were made are findings of facts for the trial judge.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>AFTER DISCOVERY</TI>
<P>HRM also points out that following discovery, it made it clear to the Plaintiff that it would not be relying on the presumptions of Matthew Dunn or the opinions of Desmond Munden (which were based on the presumptions contained in Mr. Dunn's email) at trial. The failure of Mr. Harfouche to object to the line of questioning calling for opinions from Mr. Munden or those which misinterpreted Mr. Dunn's e-mail is not determinative of the matter as oversights are often covered by counsel after discovery.</P>
<P>HRM has been cooperative with the Plaintiff regarding further discoveries. A request is currently on hold for the discovery of a second witness who can speak to policies regarding snow removal damage relating to sign posts. HRM was unaware that the Plaintiff was claiming that Mr. Munden was the designated manager of HRM until the filing of the within motion.</P>
<P>HRM asks this court to dismiss the Plaintiff's motion with costs.</P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>
