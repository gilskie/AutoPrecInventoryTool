<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>In 1885 the English courts held that positive covenants do not bind successors in title to property in <CASEREF><SOC>Austerberry v. Corporation of Oldham</SOC></CASEREF> (the &ldquo;<EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule&rdquo;).</P>
<P>Since then, courts in both England and Canada have recognized that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule may create harsh consequences, leaving a party free to enjoy the benefit of a negative covenant without having to perform a corresponding positive covenant.</P>
<P>This is such a case.</P>
<P>Jameson House is a development that involves a number of airspace parcels. The owners of residential strata units in Jameson House use a parkade owned by the Appellant pursuant to a detailed easement agreement which requires them to pay a share of the cost of maintaining and operating the parkade. The residential strata owners continue to use the parkade, but do not want to be bound to pay a share of the cost of maintaining and operating it. The Respondent has obtained a declaration that it is not bound by the easement agreement.</P>
<P>The English courts have identified two common law principles that modify the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, the conditional grant principle and the benefit and burden principle.</P>
<P>In <CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the existence of the benefit and burden principle, but that decision seems to have been ignored or forgotten.</P>
<P>The Ontario Court of Appeal is the only appellate court in Canada that has recently and expressly considered the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. It recognized the conditional grant principle, but not the benefit and burden principal.</P>
<P>It is time for B.C. to recognize the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, which, if applied in this case, would require the Respondent to comply with the easement agreement.</P></BLOCK1>

<P>4. The parkade at Jameson House is unique, as it is an automated parking and storage system (the &ldquo;Parkade&rdquo;). A vehicle is driven into an elevator, at which point the driver and passengers disembark and an automated system parks the vehicle in the Parkade. The cost of operating and maintaining the Parkade is substantial.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 32</P1></P>
<P>5. The Owners, Strata Plan BCS 4006 (the &ldquo;Strata Corporation&rdquo;) own Airspace Parcel # 1. The Appellant owns the Remainder Parcel, which is where the Parkade is located and pays the costs of maintaining and operating the Parkade. The Appellant then seeks reimbursement from the other owners and occupants of Jameson House pursuant to an easement agreement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>c)</N><TI>The Easement Agreement</TI>
<P>6. The design of Jameson House requires the owners and occupants of each airspace parcel to be able to use and access the shared facilities such as the electrical, mechanical and fire suppression systems, as well as the Parkade.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 33</P1></P>
<P>7. On October 1, 2010, a comprehensive easement agreement was executed to ensure that the owners and occupants of each airspace parcel are able to use and access portions of Jameson House they do not own and use and enjoy the shared mechanical, electrical and fire suppression systems and Parkade the (&ldquo;Easement Agreement&rdquo;). The Easement Agreement requires the owners and occupants of Jameson House to pay a share of the cost of operating and maintaining the Shared Facilities.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 34</P1></P>
<P>8. In particular, the Easement Agreement permits the owners of residential strata units (the &ldquo;Residential Strata Owners&rdquo;) to use the Parkade and requires the Strata Corporation to pay a share of the cost of maintaining and operating the Parkade (the &ldquo;Parkade Expenses&rdquo;).</P>
<P>9. The key portions of the Easement Agreement include: :
<P1>(a) clause 5.3 which grants an easement permitting the Residential Strata Owners to use the Parkade;</P1>
<P1>(b) clauses 5.3.6 to 5.3.10 which specify the Parkade Expenses to which the Residential Strata Owners are required to contribute and set out the manner by which the costs are to be calculated, charged to the Strata Corporation, paid and disputed;</P1>
<P1>(c) clauses 5.4 and 5.9 which provide similar rights of access to the owners of other airspace parcels and require the owners of those airspace parcels to pay a share of the Parkade Expenses; and</P1>
<P1>(d) clause 13.1 which provides that the Easement Agreement runs with the land and is binding on successors.
<P2>Appeal Book, Vol 1, pp. 128, 151&ndash;154, 154-155, 156-157 and 175</P2></P1></P>
<P>10. The Easement Agreement was registered in the Land Title Office on December 24, 2010, and the terms of the Easement Agreement were disclosed to potential purchasers in disclosure statements filed with the Financial Institutions Commission. Until shortly before the hearing of this matter, the strata by-laws stated that the Strata Corporation was bound by the Easement Agreement.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 49</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>d)</N><TI>Payment of Parkade Expenses</TI>
<P>11. The Residential Strata Owners have used the Parkade continuously since the building has been occupied. There is no evidence that the Residential Strata Owners intend to disclaim their right to use the Parkade.</P>
<P>12. The Strata Corporation paid the Parkade Expenses from August 1, 2011 until about May, 2016.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment, para 50</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ERRORS IN JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>13. The trial judge erred by:
<P1>(a) concluding that the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Heritage Capital Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 19</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <EM>(&ldquo;Heritage Capital&rdquo;)</EM> is authority for the proposition that the only circumstance in which a positive covenant will be binding on successors in title is when a statute provides for the covenant to run with the land;</P1>
<P1>(b) concluding that the provisions of the Easement Agreement which require the Strata Corporation to pay a share of the Parkade Expenses were not enforceable because the obligation to pay a share of the Parkade Expenses is a positive covenant that does not run with the land, which conclusion was based on the erroneous premise that the rule in <EM>Austerberry</EM> is an absolute rule that has not been modified and does not permit exceptions;</P1>
<P1>(c) not recognizing and applying the conditional grant principle which has been accepted by both the English courts and the Ontario courts and the benefit and burden principle which has been accepted by the English courts; and</P1>
<P1>(d) failing to consider the surrounding circumstances in which the Easement Agreement was made and the objective intentions and commercial purposes of the Easement Agreement at the time it was made in determining that the Strata Corporation's right to use the Parkade was not conditional on the payment of the Parkade Expenses.</P1></P>
<P>14. The Appellant accepts that the trial judge was bound to follow other decisions of the B.C. Supreme Court which misapplied the decision in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> and did not recognize and apply the conditional grant principle and the benefit and burden principle.</P>
<P>15. The Court of Appeal should accept that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is not absolute and has been modified to incorporate the conditional grant principle and the benefit and burden principle. The Court of Appeal should find that the Strata Corporation must pay the Parkade Expenses required by the Easement Agreement pursuant to the conditional grant principle or the benefit and burden principle.</P>
<P>16. Accordingly, this factum will not focus on the errors of the trial judge (as she was bound by the previous decisions of the B.C. Supreme Court), but rather on the reasons the Court of Appeal should accept and apply the conditional grant principle and benefit and burden principle, either as a case of first impression, or as an incremental modification of the common law.</P>
<P>17. This factum will address:
<P1>(a) the meaning of the decision in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> and the misapplication of the <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> decision by courts in Ontario and B.C.;</P1>
<P1>(b) the historical development of modifications to the rule in <EM>Austerberry</EM> in Canada and England and the current state of the law; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the application of the conditional grant principle and the benefit and burden principle to the facts in this case, in respect of which the Appellant submits the trial judge did make an error of law by failing to properly construe the Easement Agreement.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>18. Each of the errors identified in paragraph 13 are errors of law, as the trial judge misapplied <EM>Heritage Capital</EM>, failed to recognize the existence of a legal principle (the conditional grant principle and the benefit and burden principle) and approached the interpretation of the Easement Agreement without considering any of the surrounding circumstances that existed when the Easement Agreement was made.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Introduction&mdash;The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule</TI>
<P>19. In <CASEREF><SOC>Austerberry v. Corporation of Oldham</SOC></CASEREF>, the English courts decided that, at common law, positive covenants do not run with the land since a party cannot be liable to perform an obligation under a contract to which they are not a party (the &ldquo;<EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule&rdquo;).
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Austerberry v. Corporation of Oldham</SOC><YEAR>1885</YEAR><CITE>29 Ch. D. 750</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>20. English law has evolved since 1885. In England, the courts have recognized two common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule:
<P1>(a) the conditional grant principle, in which a positive covenant is enforceable against a successor in title if the grant of easement is conditional on the performance of the positive covenant; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the benefit and burden principle, in which a positive covenant is enforceable on a successor in title when the benefit of the easement and the burden of the positive covenant are conferred in the same agreement and the enjoyment of the benefit is relevant to the imposition of the burden. The benefit and burden principle permits the beneficiary of an easement to avoid the burden of performing a positive covenant by disclaiming the benefit of the easement.</P1></P>
<P>21. The Supreme Court of Canada considered and accepted the benefit and burden principle in <CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC></CASEREF>, but decided that the principle did not apply to the facts before the court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1966] S.C.R. 162</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Parkinson&rdquo;)</EM></P1></P>
<P>22. Two Ontario Court of Appeal decisions have accepted that the conditional grant principle applies in Ontario, but neither decision accepted or applied the benefit and burden principle.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Amberwood Investments Ltd. v. Durham Condominium Corp. No. 123</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>58 O.R. (3d) 481</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Amberwood</EM>&rdquo;)</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Black v. Owen</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 397</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(&ldquo;Black&rdquo;)</EM></P1></P>
<P>23. In <EM>Amberwood</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal declined to accept the benefit and burden principle out of deference to the legislature and a concern that the English law was unsettled. In <EM>Black</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal was not asked to overturn <EM>Amberwood</EM>, nor was the five-judge panel required to overturn a previous decision requested.</P>
<P>24. Until recently the B.C. courts had not expressly considered the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. Three recent decisions of the B.C. Supreme Court (including the decision on appeal) have held that there are no common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule in B.C.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Strata Plan LMS 3905 v. Crystal Square Parking Corp.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 71</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Crystal Square</EM>&rdquo;)</P1>

<P>25. The B.C. Court of Appeal has never expressly considered the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule.</P>
<P>26. The decision in <EM>Scottsdale</EM> emphasized the need for a definitive ruling from the B.C. Court of Appeal:
<QUOTE><P>I am advised that the <EM>Crystal Square</EM> decision is under appeal, so perhaps we will receive some clarity from our own Court of Appeal whether they are prepared to adopt the <EM>Amberwood</EM> exception into B.C. law. (para 50)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. Likewise, the trial judge commented:
<QUOTE><P>Though the Ontario Court of Appeal has recently re-affirmed that a conditional grant in line with the description from <EM>Halsbury's</EM> is enforceable in that province, two decisions from the British Columbia Supreme Court have recently concluded otherwise. I note that <EM>Crystal Square</EM> is currently under appeal, so our Court of Appeal may reach its own decision on that matter. (para 155)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. More and more people in B.C. live in developments in which common facilities are shared. The B.C. Court of Appeal should recognize both of the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule to ensure that those who have obtained an easement to use a shared facility contribute to the cost of that facility.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The Heritage Capital Decision is Not Dispositive and Has Been Misapplied</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>29. The trial judge erred in finding that the decision in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> stood for the proposition that the only exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule arise from statute. Indeed, a number of other decisions have made the same error. <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> was a decision in which a statutory exception was at issue. Common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule were neither argued, nor considered. The Supreme Court of Canada did not have to grapple with, and did not overrule, its decision in <EM>Parkinson</EM> in which it recognized the benefit and burden principle.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI>Heritage Capital Did Not Address Common Law Modifications</TI>
<P>30. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> is not authority for the proposition that the only circumstance in which an affirmative covenant will be binding on successors in title is where a statute provides for it, merely because it contains the following statement:
<QUOTE><P>The idea of a payment obligation running with land is by its nature unusual. In fact, it is undisputed that at common law, positive covenants cannot run with the land (<CASEREF><SOC>Austerberry v. Oldham</SOC><YEAR>1885</YEAR><CITE>29 Ch. D. 750</CITE><COURTJUR>Eng. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>). This rule is founded on the principle that at common law, a person cannot be made liable upon a contract unless he or she was party to it (<CASEREF><SOC>Rhone v. Stephens</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 A.C. 310</CITE><COURTJUR>U.K. H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>). The rule against positive covenants running with the land applies even if an agreement contains an express intention to the contrary (<CASEREF><SOC>Amberwood Investments Ltd. v. Durham Condominium Corp. No. 123</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>58 O.R. (3d) 481</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>). As a result, the common law rule is that <UNDER>&ldquo;[n]o personal or affirmative covenant, requiring the expenditure of money or the doing of some act, can, apart from statute, be made to run with the land&rdquo;</UNDER> (V. Di Castri, <EM>Registration of Title to Land (loose-leaf)</EM>, vol. 1, at p. 10&ndash;4 (emphasis added), quoted in <CASEREF><SOC>Westbank Holdings Ltd. v. Westgate Shopping Centre Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 BCCA 268</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>155 B.C.A.C. 1</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>B.C.C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 16). The issue in the instant case is whether and to what extent s. 29 of the <EM>HRA</EM> displaces the common law rule by permitting positive covenants to run with the land. (para 25)</P>
<P>(Emphasis added)</P>
<P>(the &ldquo;Heritage Capital Statement&rdquo;)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>31. The issue in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> was whether, and to what extent, a provision in the <EM>Historical Resources Act</EM> modified the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule by permitting positive covenants to run with the land.</P>
<P>32. There was no consideration of any common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule because the only issue before the court was the application of a statutory exception. The Heritage Capital Statement is limited in application to cases involving statutory exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI>The Heritage Capital Statement is Inconsistent With The Authorities</TI>
<P>33. The Heritage Capital Statement cannot have been meant as an absolute rule because the authorities referred to as justification for the proposition that a positive covenant cannot run with the land apart from statute are contrary to that proposition.</P>
<P>34. The Heritage Capital Statement must apply only to cases where a statutory exception is engaged because:
<P1>(a) two of the cases referred to in the Heritage Capital Statement recognized that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule had been modified to permit common law exceptions. <EM>Amberwood</EM> recognized that the conditional grant principle might permit a positive covenant to run with the land. <CASEREF><SOC>Rhone v. Stephens</SOC></CASEREF> recognized that the benefit and burden principle might permit a positive covenant to run with the land; and
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Rhone v. Stephens</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 A.C. 310</CITE><COURTJUR>U.K. H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Rhone</EM>&rdquo;)</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) none of the cases referred to in the Heritage Capital Statement expressly disclaim the possibility of common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule.</P1></P>
<P>35. The only case referred to in the Heritage Capital Statement that does not recognize common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is <EM>Westbank</EM> (&ldquo;<EM>Westbank</EM>&rdquo;), in which the B.C. Court of Appeal quotes an extract from <EM>DiCastri, Registration of Title to Land</EM> that includes the proposition that a positive covenant cannot run with the land apart from statute.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Westbank Holdings Ltd. v. Westgate Shopping Centres Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 BCCA 268</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Westbank</EM>&rdquo;)</P1>
<P1>V. Di Castri, <EM>Registration of Title to Land (loose-leaf)</EM>, vol. 1, at p. 10&ndash;4</P1></P>
<P>36. The decision in <EM>Westbank</EM> and the reference to the <EM>Di Castri</EM> text in the <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> Statement are of limited value because:
<P1>(a) the Court of Appeal was not asked to consider the existence or application of the conditional grant principle or benefit and burden principle in <EM>Westbank</EM>, nor did it consider the decision in <EM>Parkinson</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(b) the <EM>Di Castri</EM> text referred to in <EM>Westbank</EM> was published in 1987, years before the decisions in <EM>Rhone</EM> and <EM>Amberwood</EM> confirmed the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule;</P1>
<P1>(c) the authorities <EM>Di Castri</EM> cites as authority for the proposition that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is absolute apart from statutory exceptions do not support that proposition; and</P1>
<P1>(d) <EM>Westbank</EM> was decided prior to the decision in <EM>Amberwood</EM> which confirmed the conditional grant principle was part of Ontario law and before a number of English decisions which applied the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>d)</N><TI>Heritage Capital Did Not Address the Decision in <EM>Parkinson</EM></TI>
<P>37. In <EM>Parkinson</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule was not absolute and had been modified by the benefit and burden principle. If the Supreme Court of Canada intended <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> to overrule <EM>Parkinson</EM> it had to do so expressly.</P>
<P>38. In <EM>Parkinson</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the benefit and burden principle expressed in <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF>, the case from which the benefit and burden principle originated, but concluded that it did not apply to the facts in <EM>Parkinson</EM>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC><CITE>[1957] Ch. 169</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Halsall&rdquo;)</EM></P1></P>
<P>39. <EM>Parkinson</EM> involved an obligation to repair a stairway that had been damaged in a fire. The issue was whether a positive covenant to repair a stairway ran with the land to bind successors in title. The original parties had agreed that a neighbour could use a wall as a party-wall so long as he agreed to keep the stairway in good repair.</P>
<P>40. The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal was delivered by Kelly JA and he relied on the English decision in <EM>Halsall</EM>. In <EM>Halsall</EM> a predecessor in title had been granted the right to use the estate roads and sewers and had covenanted to pay a portion of those cost of maintaining these facilities. It was held that a party could not exercise their rights without paying the costs necessary to ensure that they could be exercised. Kelly JA wrote:
<QUOTE><P>...[In <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF>] [t]he Court held that <EM>prima facie</EM> the covenants contained in the deed were unenforceable in that a positive covenant in the terms contained in the deed did not run with the land. But the Court further held that the defendants were not entitled to take advantage of the trusts granting them the use of the road and other benefits created without undertaking the obligations which were attached thereto. The defendants were free to abandon the use of the roads and remain free from the onus of repairing, but if they chose to avail themselves of the use of the roads, they must assume the burden of repairing.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1965] 1 O.R. 117</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> para 13</P1></P>
<P>41. Kelly JA described three grounds on which the plaintiff was entitled to succeed, the third of which concerned the principle from <EM>Halsall</EM>.</P>
<P>42. In the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Parkinson</EM>, Cartwright J. wrote for the court and summarized the conclusions of the Court of Appeal:
<QUOTE><P>The reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered by Kelly J.A. After reciting the facts he held, (i) that there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, (ii) that there was no privity of estate between them and, (iii) that the covenant to repair and reconstruct the stairway did not run with the land. I agree with the views of the learned Justice of Appeal on these three points...</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>However, Kelly J.A. went on to hold the plaintiff entitled to succeed on three grounds. (para 11)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>43. Cartwright J. dealt with the benefit and burden principle (the third ground) as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The third ground was based on the maxim, <EM>Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus</EM>. It was said that as the appellants' predecessor in title, Telford Sinclair Parkinson, and the appellants themselves, had enjoyed the privileges contained in the agreements registered as numbers 5294, 5330, 6134, and 6518 referred to in the deed dated April 1, 1946, in part recited above, they could not refuse to perform the obligations contained in the agreement 12360. The first four mentioned agreements were not put in evidence but counsel for the appellants, for the purposes of this appeal, was willing to admit that they conferred on the owners of lot 28 the right to use the westerly wall on lot 29 as a party-wall.</P>
<P>Assuming that so long as the appellants made use of the last-mentioned wall as a party-wall they were bound to keep the stairway in repair, they ceased to be under any such obligation when they no longer made use of the respondent's wall. It is not suggested that the appellants have made any use of that wall since their building was destroyed by fire. A case in which this principle was applied is <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF> which was discussed in the reasons of Kelly J.A.</P>
<P>For the above reasons I am of opinion that since the time when the building on lot 28 was destroyed the appellants have been under no obligation enforceable at law or in equity to replace the stairway. (para 17&ndash;19)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>44. The Supreme Court of Canada clearly recognized the existence of the benefit and burden principle&mdash;it referred to <EM>Halsall</EM>, the leading English decision and considered the benefit and burden principle, deciding that it did not apply because the appellants had disclaimed and no longer received the benefit of the agreement.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>e)</N><TI>Heritage Capital Did Not Overrule Parkinson</TI>
<P>45. In <EM>Parkinson</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule had been modified by the benefit and burden principle.</P>
<P>46. Even if recognition of the benefit and burden principle in <EM>Parkinson</EM> was only <EM>obiter dicta</EM>, it was part of the &ldquo;wider circle of analysis which was obviously intended for guidance and which should be accepted as authoritative&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Henry</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 76</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>47. <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> cannot have the effect of overruling that part of the decision in <EM>Parkinson</EM> which dealt with the benefit and burden principle because to overrule its own decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada &ldquo;must be satisfied based on compelling reasons that the precedent was wrongly decided and should be overruled&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Teva Canada Ltd. vs. TD Canada Trust</SOC><CITE>2017 SCC 51</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>48. Since the court in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> did not mention <EM>Parkinson</EM> it cannot be taken to have overruled it. Since it did not do so, <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> must be reconciled with <EM>Parkinson</EM> by acknowledging that the <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> Statement is limited to matters involving a statutory exception to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule and that <EM>Parkinson</EM> remains a binding precedent.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>f)</N><TI>The Misapplication of Heritage Capital</TI>
<P>49. Four Canadian decisions (including the decision on appeal) have misapplied the decision in <EM>Heritage</EM> Capital by stating that <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> is authority for the proposition that the only circumstance in which an affirmative covenant will be binding on successors in title is where a statute provides for an exception.
<P1><EM>Jameson House</EM>, para 59</P1>
<P1><EM>Black</EM>, paragraph 41</P1>
<P1><EM>Crystal Square</EM>, paragraph 45 and 55</P1>
<P1><EM>Scottsdale</EM>, paragraph 43</P1></P>
<P>50. The repeated misapplication of the <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> decision has reinforced the erroneous notion that Canadian law does not recognize any modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule other than statutory exceptions, which is inconsistent with the decisions in <EM>Parkinson, Amberwood</EM> and <EM>Black</EM>, all of which recognized a modification to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule.</P>
<P>51. That inconsistency is highlighted in the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Black</EM> which both expressly recognized the validity of the conditional grant principle <UNDER>and</UNDER> held that <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> prohibited positive covenants from binding successors in title &ldquo;apart from statute&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Black</EM>, paragraph 40 and 63</P1></P>
<P>52. Simply put, the <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> Statement cannot be authority for absolute adherence to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule apart from statutory exceptions when that proposition is inconsistent with the decisions in <EM>Amberwood</EM> and <EM>Rhone</EM> (which the Supreme Court of Canada referred to as the basis for the Heritage Capital Statement) and the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Black</EM> which accepts the Heritage Capital Statement as binding authority, then re-affirms the validity of the conditional grant principle, which is precisely the type of common law exception to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule that would seem to be precluded by the Heritage Capital Statement.</P>
<P>53. The only way to reconcile these decisions is to accept that <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> applies only to cases in which a statutory exception is at issue.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>The Austerberry Rule Is Not Absolute</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>54. The trial judge erred by concluding that the obligation to pay for the Parkade Expenses pursuant to the Easement Agreement was not enforceable because it was a positive covenant that does not run with the land. This conclusion is premised on the erroneous finding that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is an absolute rule that does not admit of exceptions. Common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule have been, or should be, recognized.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI>Opportunity to Acknowledge Modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule</TI>
<P>55. The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is a creature of English common law. If the courts could proscribe that positive covenants run with the land in the first place, then it is rational for the courts to subsequently curtail that proscription by later introducing exceptions and limitations, just as they have done in England where the recognition of such exceptions is now viewed as &ldquo;settled law&rdquo;.</P>
<P>56. According to Professor Ziff, the courts should not view common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule with &ldquo;dismay&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>Few would quarrel with the value of wholesale rationalization of the law of servitudes. Until that happens, incremental adjustments through the caselaw should not be regarded with surprise or dismay. There are no compelling reasons why the schemes sought in <EM>Reed Services</EM> and <EM>Tito</EM> should not be regarded as permissible as an ordinary incident of private property ownership. In both cases, allowing affirmative burdens to run with land would have enabled the parties to meet their intended objectives in a straightforward and inexpensive fashion.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Ziff, &ldquo;Positive Covenants Running With the Land: A Castaway on Ocean Land?&rdquo;</EM> Alberta Law Review Vol. XXVII, No. 3, p. 354, para 372</P1></P>
<P>57. Likewise, in his dissent in <EM>Amberwood</EM>, Macpherson J.A. stated:
<QUOTE><P>Canadian society and the patterns of property ownership in 2002 are very different from English society and land ownership in 1885 when Austerberry was decided. The Ontario legislature has recognized the differences and enacted laws mitigating the rigours of the rule in Austerberry&mdash;on 12 occasions.</P>
<P>In my view, the benefit-burden and conditional grant exceptions to the rule in Austerberry can perform a similar role if introduced into the common law of Ontario. As I have tried to explain the exceptions, their adoption would, as required by Bastarache J. in <EM>Friedmann Equity</EM>, result in incremental change with consequences capable of assessment. They would also meet Justice Cardozo's important objective of mitigating hardships or wrongs in appropriate cases. This is one of those cases. The intentions of the original contracting parties and the wording in the agreement they signed are both crystal clear: a regime of reciprocal easements and other benefits and cost sharing was established. Amberwood, a successor in title to one of the contracting parties, chose, with full knowledge of the clear terms of the original agreement, to accept and utilize the benefits of the agreement. In my view, it would be unjust to permit Amberwood to ignore the reciprocal burdens which the agreement so clearly imposes on it. (para. 159-160)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>58. This appeal presents a landmark opportunity for the Court of Appeal to revisit the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule and to recognize that the conditional grant principle and benefit and burden principle have modified the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, either as a case of first impression or an incremental change to the common law.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI>The History of Modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule</TI>
<P>59. The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule was developed in 1885. Since then:
<P1>(a) In 1957, the English High Court established the benefit and burden principle in <EM>Halsall</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(b) In 1966, the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule was first applied in Canada by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Parkinson</EM>, ironically in the very case in which the Supreme Court of Canada referred to and considered the benefit and burden principle arising from <EM>Halsall</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(c) In 1977, <CASEREF><SOC>Tito v. Waddell (No. 2)</SOC></CASEREF> expanded the benefit and burden principle;
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Tito v. Waddell (No. 2)</SOC><CITE>[1977] 3 ALL E.R. 129</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Tito&rdquo;)</EM></P2></P1>
<P1>(d) In 1994, the House of Lords rejected the decision in <EM>Tito</EM>, but confirmed the validity of the benefit and burden principle in <EM>Rhone;</EM></P1>
<P1>(e) In 2002, the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Amberwood</EM> was the first opportunity for a Canadian court to consider whether the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is absolute, or whether it admits of exceptions.</P1>
<P1>(f) In <EM>Amberwood</EM>, after reviewing the then English law that had modified the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, the court recognized the conditional grant principle and concluded:
<ITEM><P>It &ldquo;would be inadvisable to adopt the doctrine in <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF> into Ontario law &ldquo;having regard to the uncertainties and the many frailties in existing common law in England&rdquo;. (Para 75).</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>A free standing conditional grant exception &ldquo;must fail, essentially for the same reason that I have rejected the first exception&rdquo;. (Para 85 - 86).</P></ITEM></P1>
<P1>(g) In 2009, the benefit and burden principle was considered by the court in <CASEREF><SOC>Odd Guys Holdings Ltd. v. C.Y. Ciao Enterprises Co. Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> with specific reference to the decisions in <EM>Parkinson</EM> and <EM>Halsall</EM>, but the court concluded that it would not apply because there was no benefit.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Odd Guys Holdings Ltd. v. C.Y. Ciao Enterprises Co. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2009 BCSC 1867</CITE></CASEREF></P2></P1>
<P1>(h) Since <EM>Amberwood</EM> was decided in 2001, the law in England relating to the benefit and burden exception has gone from what Charron JA described in <EM>Amberwood</EM> as being subject to &ldquo;uncertainties&rdquo; and &ldquo;frailties&rdquo; to being described by <EM>Gale on Easements</EM> (19<SUP>th</SUP> Ed.) as &ldquo;settled&rdquo; law.
<P2>Jonathan Gaunt, Q.C. &amp; The Hon. Mr. Justice Morgan, <EM>Gale on Easements</EM>, 19<SUP>th</SUP> ed. (Sweet &amp; Maxwell: London, 2012), at p. 57</P2></P1>
<P1>(i) There are three decisions of the English Court of Appeal decided since Amberwood that have contributed to the settling of the law;
<ITEM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Davies v. Jones</SOC><CITE>[2009] EWCA Civ 1164</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Davies&rdquo;)</EM>.</P></ITEM>

<P1>(j) The most recent consideration of this issue by an appellate court in Canada was by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Black</EM>, which declined to address modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, (although it confirmed the existence of the conditional grant principle). The court, sitting as a three justice division, concluded that the decision in <EM>Amberwood</EM> was binding absent:
<ITEM><P>Being reconsidered by a five justice division, which had not been requested, or</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>An authoritative pronouncement by the Supreme Court of Canada that displaces the majority's holdings in <EM>Amberwood</EM>.</P></ITEM></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>d)</N><TI>The Decision in Amberwood</TI>
<P>60. In Amberwood, the court recognized that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule created harsh results and should be modified:
<QUOTE><P>It appears to be equally undisputed that the rule at times causes inconvenience, that its application in some cases may even result in unfairness, and that the present state of the law should be modified to meet the needs of modern conveyancing. (para 17)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. Charron J. (as she then was) framed her legal analysis as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Therefore, since positive covenants do not run with the land <EM>Amberwood</EM> is not bound by the positive covenant to pay the interim expenses under the Reciprocal Agreement solely by virtue of having acquired the Phase 2 lands with notice of its terms. The question remains whether <EM>Amberwood</EM> is liable to pay the expenses under some other recognized legal principle.</P>
<P>First, DCC 123 places reliance on the doctrine of benefit and burden in <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF> as a method of avoiding the application of the rule...</P>
<P>The second method relied upon by DCC 123 is the conditional grant of easement. (para. 18&ndash;20)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>62. In <EM>Amberwood</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal did not decide that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule precluded consideration of other legal principles, apart from statutory exceptions, under which <EM>Amberwood</EM> could be liable. It is clear that Charron JA considered the issue in two steps; first, she acknowledged and articulated the general rule that positive covenants do not run with the land, second she considered whether, notwithstanding the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, there might be another legal principle by which <EM>Amberwood</EM> could be liable.</P>
<P>63. In fact, consistent with this two step approach, Charron JA organized her judgment into and considered separately &ldquo;Statutory exceptions to the rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-statutory methods to circumvent the rule&rdquo; (paragraphs 51 and 53).</P>
<P>64. Charron JA rejected the introduction into Ontario of the benefit and burden principle and the notion of an exception to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule based on a conditional grant. Notwithstanding that conclusion, she wrote:
<QUOTE><P>I note at the outset that the principle from <EM>Halsbury's Laws of England</EM> relied upon by the applications judge seems to me to be consonant with the rule in <EM>Austerberry</EM>. I repeat it here for convenience:
<QUOTE><P>If the facts establish that the granting of a benefit or easement was conditional on assuming the positive obligation, then the obligation is binding. Where the obligation is framed so as to constitute a continuing obligation upon which the grant of the easement was conditional, <EM>the obligation can be imposed as an incident of the easement itself, and not merely a liability purporting to run with the land</EM>. [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Hence, as a matter of construction of the creating instrument itself, if a grant of benefit or easement is framed as conditional upon the continuing performance of a positive obligation, the positive obligation may well be enforceable, not because it would run with the land, but because the condition would serve to limit the scope of the grant itself. In effect, the law would simply be giving effect to the grant. Indeed, as discussed earlier in this judgment at paragraphs 30 and 31, much the same reasoning underlies the law of restrictive covenants. (para 85 - 86)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>65. <EM>Amberwood</EM> does not stand for the proposition that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is absolute and exists without modification apart from statute. To the contrary, <EM>Amberwood</EM> recognized that a positive covenant may be enforceable against a successor in title if the performance of the positive covenant is a condition of the grant.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>e)</N><TI>Development of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule in England</TI>
<P>66. In <EM>Amberwood</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal was reluctant to accept and apply the benefit and burden principle because English law was uncertain:
<QUOTE><P>...having regard to the uncertainties and the many frailties of the existing common law in England in this area of the law, it would be inadvisable to adopt these principles in Ontario. (para 75)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>67. Since the Ontario Court of Appeal was concerned with, in part, the frailties and uncertainties in English law, it is logical to consider the approach taken by the English courts since <EM>Amberwood</EM>.</P>
<P>68. Since <EM>Rhone</EM>, English law was moved away from the &ldquo;pure principle of benefit and burden&rdquo; (which required no link between the benefit and burden), but it has emphatically accepted and applied both a conditional grant exception and the benefit and burden exception.</P>
<P>69. In 2013, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the benefit and burden exception was part of English law in <EM>Wilkinson</EM>.</P>
<P>70. In <EM>Wilkinson</EM>, the owners of units in a subdivision attempted to avoid their obligation to pay the cost of operating and repairing common amenities on the basis of the rule in <EM>Austerberry</EM>. The Court of Appeal reconciled the previous English decisions stating:
<QUOTE><P>What Lord Templeman emphasised in <CASEREF><SOC>Rhone v. Stephens</SOC></CASEREF> was that a successor in title to the original covenantor did not incur a liability to perform a positive covenant such as the covenant to repair in that case unless it had some real relation to a right granted in his favour under the conveyance which he did wish to exercise. The reference in his speech to the exercise of those rights being conditional upon the performance of the positive obligation is not, as he made clear, limited to cases in which it is expressly so conditional. (para 27)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>71. The Court of Appeal concluded that the payment of an annual charge to maintain the facilities which the defendants were only entitled to use because of the rights granted by the agreement which contained the positive covenant was relevant to the continued exercise of those rights even though it was not a direct contribution to the cost of their maintenance, (para 28).</P>
<P>72. The Court concluded by stating:
<QUOTE><P>The successors in title (whether under Form A or Form B conveyances) have therefore no answer to these claims unless they can show that the payment covenant has no relation whatever to the Schedule 1 rights which they have continued to exercise. As a matter of construction, that is not correct for the reasons I have given. Although the continued exercise of the Schedule 1 rights is not made expressly conditional upon payment (any more than it was in <CASEREF><SOC>Halsall v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF> or in <CASEREF><SOC>Thamesmead Town Ltd. v. Allotey</SOC></CASEREF>) the payment is intended to ensure that the rights remain capable of being exercised. <UNDER>The authorities require one to look beyond the express terms of conveyance and consider what in substance the covenantor is paying for. Here, as in</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Hallsal v. Brizell</SOC></CASEREF><UNDER>, the payment, at least in substantial part, is intended to provide a contribution to the cost of maintaining the roads and other facilities over which the owners of the bungalows are granted rights. None of them has ceased to use the roads nor wishes to do so.</UNDER> (Emphasis added) (para 33)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. Shortly after the decision in <EM>Wilkinson</EM>, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales issued a decision in <EM>Goodman</EM> which applied the benefit and burden exception.</P>
<P>74. In <EM>Goodman</EM>, the defendants attempted to avoid an obligation to contribute to the maintenance of a road which provided access to their premises. The road was located on the plaintiff's property. An agreement provided the defendant with the right to use the road. The agreement required the plaintiff to maintain the road and the defendants to pay a portion of the expense associated with maintaining the road.</P>
<P>75. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales described the test for the application of the benefit and burden exception as follows:
<QUOTE><P>In <CASEREF><SOC>Davies v. Jones</SOC><CITE>[2009] EWCA Civ 1164</CITE><PAGENUM>at [27]</PAGENUM></CASEREF> the Chancellor, Sir Andrew Morritt, identified from the authorities three conditions which need to be satisfied in order for the burden of a positive covenant such as the one in this case to be enforceable against the covenantor's successors in title. They are, he said:</P>
<P>&ldquo;(1) The benefit and burden must be conferred in or by the same transaction. In the case of benefits and burdens in relation to land it is almost inevitable that the transaction in question will be effected by one or more deeds or other documents.</P>
<P>(2) The receipt or enjoyment of the benefit must be relevant to the imposition of the burden in the sense that the former must be conditional on or reciprocal to the latter. Whether that requirement is satisfied is a question of construction of the deeds or other documents whether the question arises in the case of land or the terms of the transaction, if not reduced to writing, on other cases. In each case it will depend on the express terms of the transaction and any implications to be derived from them.</P>
<P>(3) The person on whom the burden is alleged to have been imposed must have or have had the opportunity of rejecting or disclaiming the benefit, not merely the right to receive the benefit. (para 24)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>76. The Court of Appeal emphasized that the requirement that the benefit must be relevant to the burden was a matter of substance, not form. The Court of Appeal concluded that there was a &ldquo;clear and obvious link between the rights-of-way reserved over Roadway 4 and an obligation to contribute to the cost of repairs.&rdquo; (para 28)</P>
<P>77. According to <EM>Gale on Easements</EM>, it is now &ldquo;settled&rdquo; that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule has been modified:
<QUOTE><P>It is now settled that that there are two requirements for the enforceability of a positive covenant against a successor in title to the covenantor under this doctrine: first, the condition of discharging the burden must be relevant to the exercise of the rights that enable the benefit to be obtained; secondly, the successor must have the opportunity to choose whether to take or renounce the benefit and thereby escape the burden. So, a successor does not have to contribute to the cost of a facility which he is neither entitled to or chooses not to enjoy.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Gale on Easements</EM> at p. 57</P1></P>
<P>78. As recognized by the trial judge:
<QUOTE><P>To summarize then, the principles espoused in <EM>Rhone</EM>, <EM>Wilkinson</EM> and <EM>Goodman</EM> reflect the current state of the law in England. The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule continues to apply. However, the burden of a positive covenant will be enforceable against the covenantor's successor-in-title if three conditions are met: the benefit must be conditional on or reciprocal to the burden, and then bearer of the burden must be able to reject or disclaim the benefit, not merely the right to receive it. (para 95)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>f)</N><TI>The Decision in <EM>Black v. Owen</EM></TI>
<P>79. In <EM>Black</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned a decision finding that both the conditional grant principle and benefit and burden principle were part of Ontario law.</P>
<P>80. The decision in <EM>Black</EM> is premised on the lower courts failure to apply the decision in <EM>Amberwood</EM>, which was binding precedent. The parties expressly declined a reconsideration of <EM>Amberwood</EM> by a give judge panel. (para 39)</P>
<P>81. However, the Ontario Court of Appeal did re-affirm the existence of conditional grant principle recognized in <EM>Amberwood</EM>, but found that it did not apply on the facts and was not a &ldquo;separate and distinct exception&rdquo; to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. (para 63)</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>g)</N><TI>A Measured Modification of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is Appropriate</TI>
<P>82. The decision in <EM>Parkinson</EM> requires the Court of Appeal to recognize the benefit and burden principle. If the Court of Appeal is not bound by <EM>Parkinson</EM>, it may modify the common law when it is appropriate to do so.

<P>83. In <EM>Rosas</EM>, the B.C. Court of Appeal stated:

<P>84. It is appropriate to acknowledge the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule which are recognized in England and, in part, in Ontario.</P>

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>The Trial Judge Misinterpreted the Easement Agreement</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>86. Although the trial judge purported to construe the Easement Agreement to determine whether the covenant to pay the Parkade Expenses was a condition of the grant of easement, she did not approach the interpretation of the Easement Agreement properly. Particularly the trial judge failed to consider the whole of the Easement Agreement, the surrounding circumstances and its business efficacy. Moreover, the trial judge did not consider whether the Strata Corporation could be required to pay the Parkade expenses pursuant to the benefit and burden principle.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI>The Failure to Consider the Surrounding Circumstances is an Error of Law</TI>
<P>87. The trial judge's failure to consider the surrounding circumstances in which the Easement Agreement was made is an extricable error of law which permits this court to substitute its own conclusion by properly construing the Easement Agreement by considering the whole of it, the surrounding circumstances and its business efficacy.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Creston Moly Corp. v. Sattva Capital Corp.</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 53</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 53</P1></P>
<P>88. Failing to apply the fundamental rules of contractual interpretation amounts to an error of law. This includes a failure to consider &ldquo;all the surrounding circumstances and not only the words used in documenting the transaction&rdquo;.

<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI>Applicable Principles of Contractual Interpretation</TI>
<P>89. The applicable principles are as follows:
<ITEM><P>Contracts are to be interpreted in the &ldquo;factual matrix&rdquo; known to the parties at the time. A written agreement must be understood not in a vacuum, but with &ldquo;knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating.&rdquo;

<ITEM><P>The words of one provision must not be read in isolation but should be considered in harmony with the rest of the contract and in light of its purposes and commercial context and that meaning must be given to all of the words in a contract

<ITEM><P>In determining whether a common law modification to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule applies, the court should consider the substance of the agreement, rather than its form.
<P1><EM>Goodman</EM>, para 28</P1></P></ITEM></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>d)</N><TI>The Easement is Conditional on the Payment of Parkade Expenses</TI>
<P>90. The Easement Agreement grants an easement to use the Parkade but that grant of easement is conditional on the payment of the Parkade Expenses, meaning that the obligation is binding, not as an exception to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, but because it is part of and limits the scope of the grant of easement.</P>
<P>91. The interrelationship between the first paragraph of section 5.3 of the Easement Agreement and subsections (a) and (b) that follow evidence the conditionality of the grant:
<P1>(a) The first paragraph of section 5 grants the easement &ldquo;...<UNDER>subject to the following terms, conditions and limitations</UNDER>&rdquo;, meaning all of the provisions of section 5.3.</P1>
<P1>(b) Section 5.3 (a) qualifies the extent of the easement granted under section 5.3 by confirming that the area used to access the Parkade may be used by the Residential Strata Owners only the purpose of accessing the Parkade.</P1>
<P1>(c) However, and importantly, there is an almost identical repetition in section 5.3(a) of the subject clause in section 5.3, with the addition of the words &ldquo;herein contained&rdquo;&mdash;the right of the Residential Strata Owners to access the Parkade is &ldquo;<UNDER>subject to the terms, conditions and limitations herein contained</UNDER>&rdquo;. Section 13.6(d) states that the use of the word &ldquo;herein&rdquo; means a reference to the Easement Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or subsection or other subdivision.</P1>
<P1>(d) The right of the Residential Strata Owners to access (and thereby use) the Parkade is expressly &ldquo;subject to&rdquo; (in other words, conditional on) compliance with and performance of all of the &ldquo;terms, conditions and limitations&rdquo; <UNDER>throughout the whole of the Easement Agreement</UNDER>, which would include being subject to:
<ITEM><P>All of the provisions of section 5.3, including sections 5.3.3 (Reservations and Limitations), 5.3.5 (Covenants), 5.3.6. (Parkade Operating Costs), 5.3.8 (Reimbursement), and 5.3.10 (Requirement to keep accurate operating costs);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The &ldquo;condition&rdquo; of &ldquo;Reimbursement&rdquo;, which is explained in sections 5.3.6 and 5.3.7, and specifically provided for in section 5.3.8.</P></ITEM></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>e)</N><TI>This Interpretation is Consistent With Surrounding Circumstances and a Review of the Entire Easement Agreement</TI>
<P>92. This interpretation of the words of the Easement Agreement is consistent with the surrounding circumstances and objective intentions of the parties when the Easement Agreement was made. The parties recognized that it was important for the Residential Strata Owners to be able to use the Parkade, but also to pay for the maintenance and operation of the Parkade. The parties could not reasonably have expected that the Residential Strata Owners would be able to use the Parkade without paying a portion of the costs of maintaining and operating it.</P>
<P>93. The conditional nature of the grant is apparent from a review of the whole of the Easement Agreement.</P>
<P>94. Section 7.1(d) requires that the Appellant Owner operate, maintain and repair the Parkade. But there is an express proviso: &ldquo;...<UNDER>provided the cost sharing provisions of Article 10 shall apply thereto</UNDER>&rdquo;. (Emphasis added) Section 10 refers to Schedule &ldquo;E&rdquo; which provides that the Strata Corporation's share of the Parkade Costs is 80%.</P>
<P>95. The obligation to repair and maintain the Parkade (itself a positive covenant) is directly linked to the obligation on the part of the Strata Corporation to pay its share of the Parkade Expenses.</P>
<P>96. This adds an important consideration in the interpretation of the Easement Agreement. The Residential Strata Owners have an easement to use the Parkade. The Parkade will only be available for use by the Residential Strata Owners if it is maintained and operated by the Appellant. The Appellant has a positive obligation to maintain and operate the Parkade, but that obligation is expressly conditional on the Strata Corporation paying a share of the costs of operating and maintaining the Parkade. This easement to use the Parkade must be conditional on the Residential Parkade Users paying a portion of the cost of maintaining the Parkade so that it remains available for their use.</P>
<P>97. If the Strata Corporation is not required to pay its share of the Parkade Expenses, the Appellant is no longer required to operate, maintain and repair the Parkade, which cannot be consistent with the objective intentions of the parties at the time the Easement Agreement was made. The logical result of this is that if neither party is required to observe their respective positive obligations, the Parkade will cease to operate. That is a result that is surely inconsistent with the objective purposes of the Easement, its commercial context and would create an absurdity.</P>
<P>98. The conditional nature of the Appellants obligation to repair and maintain the parkade is consistent only with the conditional nature of the grant of easement. If the obligation to repair, maintain and operate the Parkade is conditional on payment of a portion of the maintenance expenses, the grant of easement itself must also be conditional on payment of a portion of the expenses because the grant will be worthless if the Parkade is not maintained, repaired or operated by the Appellant.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>f)</N><TI>The Benefit and Burden Principle Applies</TI>
<P>99. If the grant of easement is not conditional on payment of the Parkade Expenses, the Residential Strata Owners are required to pay the Parkade Expenses pursuant to the benefit and burden principle because:
<P1>(a) the benefit (the right to use the Parkade) is conveyed in the same agreement (the Easement Agreement) as the burden (the obligation to pay the Parkade Expenses);</P1>
<P1>(b) the receipt of the benefit is relevant to the imposition of the burden&mdash;the obligation to pay the Parkade Expenses is directly related to the right to use the Parkade; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the Residential Strata Owners are free to decline the right to use the Parkade, in which case they would not have to contribute to the cost of its maintenance.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>100. It is time to recognize the common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule that have been recognized by the English courts and, to a lesser extent, the Ontario Courts.</P>
<P>101. On an application of either the conditional grant principle or the benefit and burden principle the Strata Corporation remains obligated to pay the Parkade Expenses pursuant to the Easement Agreement.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>1. The Appellant, a well-established developer, is seeking to overturn the strong and longstanding authority in Canada against positive covenants being unenforceable against successors in title that has been a fixture of the common law for more than a century. It asks for this drastic change in the law so that it can impose positive covenants for payments on the Respondent, strata corporation which never assumed those obligations.</P>
<P>2. The Appellant asks for this extraordinary change in the law despite the absence of any Canadian precedent. Indeed, Canadian courts have expressed a justified skepticism about the principles that the Appellant seeks to import into our common law.</P>
<P>3. The Appellant also presented no evidence to support the need for such a drastic change. Indeed, the problems the Appellant is having in enforcing the covenants are entirely of its own creation. The Appellant built the development, created the strata corporation, drafted the easement for itself, entered into it with itself and then made no apparent effort to cause the strata corporation to assume it. The Appellant could have provided for the maintenance of the parkade at issue through the existing law and subject to the protections under the <EM>Strata Property Act</EM>, [SBC 1998] c. 43 (&ldquo;SPA&rdquo;). They failed to do so. There is no reasonable basis for this Court to save the Appellant by creating new law for its benefit.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>4. This dispute is over the enforceability and the terms of an airspace parcel easement agreement (&ldquo;the Easement Agreement&rdquo;). The Appellant negotiated the Easement Agreement for itself and executed it with itself before subdividing the development lands to create the Respondent, strata corporation.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 34 &amp; 44. A.R., p. 26 &amp; 28.</P1></P>
<P>5. There is no dispute that the cost-sharing obligations in the Easement Agreement are &ldquo;positive covenants.&rdquo; The Easement Agreement requires the developer to operate and maintain the parkade, and it requires the strata corporation to pay 80% of those expenses.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 38 &amp; 58, A.R., p. 27 &amp; 31.</P1></P>
<P>6. The strata corporation considers the expenses to be too high, much higher in fact, than what the developer represented in its disclosures to the original purchasers. The strata corporation sought the declaration that it was not bound by the positive covenants in the easement so that the parties could negotiate a more reasonable funding arrangement.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Jameson House Development</TI>
<P>7. Jameson House is an airspace parcel development. It consists of five separate airspace parcels constructed in a single concrete high-rise over top of an underground parkade, located on the remainder lands owned by the Appellant.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 28, A.R., p. 24.</P1></P>
<P>8. The 138 residential strata lots and common property managed by the strata corporation are located on levels 14 through 37 of the building, in what was formerly described in the materials as &ldquo;Air Space Parcel #1&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASP 1&rdquo;.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 31, A.R., p. 25.</P1></P>
<P>9. Parking for the development is located within the remainder parcel and is provided via an automated parking and storage system (the &ldquo;APSS&rdquo;) which can accommodate up to 238 vehicles. The APSS is a &ldquo;driverless&rdquo; system. Users drive their cars into an elevator located in the remainder, exit the elevator, and the APSS whisks away the car and parks it. When the user is ready to retrieve her car, she requests it from her unit and descends by elevator to the parking level. If everything goes according to plan, her car will be waiting for her by the time she arrives at the parking level.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, paras. 31-32, A.R., p. 25-26.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>The Developer's Actions before the Deposit of the Strata Plan</TI>
<P>10. The Appellant's lawyer, Mr. De Vuyst provided insight to the lower court in his affidavit into two alternative models used by developers of &ldquo;mixed-use developments&rdquo; such as Jameson House to manage the sharing of costs. He explained the two models as follows:
<P1>a) The first model involves subdividing the development by way of strata plan under the <EM>Strata Property Act</EM> and in turn creating separate sections (residential and non-residential) under s. 193 of the <EM>Strata Property Act</EM> (&ldquo;SPA&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>b) The second model involves subdividing the development into blocks of three-dimensional space called &lsquo;air space parcels&rsquo; with those portions of the parent parcel of land not so subdivided appropriately called the &lsquo;remainder parcel&rsquo;.
<P2>Reasons for Judgement, paras. 29-30, A.R., p. 25; Affidavit of De Vuyst A.B., p. 628.</P2></P1></P>
<P>11. Mr. De Vuyst then explains why some developers, including apparently his client, in this case, prefer the second, air space parcel model. He deposed:
<QUOTE><P>9. While separate sections under the SPA do provide some degree of autonomy as between the different users, the fact that all strata lots are within a single strata plan and subject to the authority of the owners enables the one group of users to potentially dominate the other.</P>
<P>10. As such, this separate section model has largely given away to the &ldquo;air space&rdquo; model which provides complete autonomy as between the different users subject, of course, to the terms of the governing agreement known as an &ldquo;air space agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASP agreement.&rdquo; The legal relationship between residential and non-residential strata lots is governed by the SPA while the legal relationship between the mixed-use air space parcels is governed not by statute, but by the terms of the ASP agreement hence underscoring the critical importance of the terms of the ASP agreement.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 30, A.R., p. 25; Affidavit of De Vuyst A.B., p. 628.</P1></P>
<P>12. The Chambers Judge found that the Appellant sought to depart from the legislated model of cost-sharing under the <EM>SPA</EM> and instead opted for the ASP model so it could exert more power and control in the building.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 169, A.R., p. 65.</P1></P>
<P>13. Before the Appellant subdivided ASP 1 to create the strata corporation, and while it owned all parcels in the development, it entered into the Easement Agreement with itself.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 34, A.R., p. 26.</P1></P>
<P>14. The relevant terms of the Easement Agreement are set out at paragraphs 35&ndash;46 of the Reasons for Judgement.</P>
<P>15. The strata corporation was never a party to the Easement Agreement, and perhaps most importantly, it has never entered into an assumption agreement as was contemplated under Article 9.2(a)(i) of the Easement Agreement.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 50, A.R., p. 31.</P1></P>
<P>16. No explanation has ever been given as to why the Appellant never attempted to cause the strata corporation to enter into an assumption agreement, something the Appellant had every opportunity to do before it surrendered control of the strata corporation to the owners if such an agreement was in the best interest of the strata corporation.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ISSUES ON APPEAL</TI>
<P>17. In response to Part 2 of the Appellant's factum, the Respondent says that the Chambers Judge was correct in holding that:
<P1>a) the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> has no exceptions in Canadian law outside of statute; and</P1>
<P1>b) policy and precedent militate against accepting a common law exception to the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>18. In specific response to Part 2, paragraph 13(d) of the Appellant's factum, the Chambers Judge considered the purpose and circumstances under which the Easement Agreement was made. Indeed, she held that those very circumstances made this a poor case in which to argue for such a significant change of the common law.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, paras. 26&ndash;34, 44&ndash;50, 169, A.R., p. 24&ndash;26, 28&ndash;31, 65.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>19. There are two questions raised by the Appellant on this appeal. The first is whether, as a matter of law, the exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> should be recognized. The parties' agree that this first issue is a matter of law and is therefore determined by the standard of correctness.</P>
<P>20. The second question is whether the Chambers Judge misinterpreted the Easement Agreement. The Appellant suggests that the Chambers Judge erred in law by failing to take note of the Easement Agreement's purpose and surrounding circumstances. If that were really the case, then that would be a matter of law, and the standard would be correctness. However, that is clearly not the case.</P>
<P>21. The Chambers Judge took note of the purpose and circumstance of the Easement Agreement's creation. It is clear from her review that the Chambers Judge appreciated the rationale of the Easement Agreement as set out by Mr. De Vuyst in his affidavit and the circumstances in which it was created.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, paras. 26&ndash;34, 44&ndash;50, 169, A.R., p. 24&ndash;26, 28&ndash;31, 65.</P1></P>
<P>22. Thus, the second issue is one of contractual interpretation which is a question of mixed fact and law for which the Chambers Judge is entittled to deference. In other words, the interpretation of the Easement Agreement by the Chambers Judge should not be disturbed unless the Appellant can demonstrate a palpable and overriding error in her analysis.

<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Positive Covenants are not Enforceable Against Successors In Title</TI>
<P>23. It is well established in Canada that positive covenants do not run with the land. This rule has been referred to as the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> in these proceedings which is a reference to <CASEREF><SOC>Austerberry v. Corporation of Oldham</SOC><YEAR>1885</YEAR><CITE>29 Ch. D. 750</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>24. The Austerberry <EM>Rule</EM> was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1966] SCR 162</CITE></CASEREF>. In that case, the dominant tenement sought to impose a repair or replacement obligation on the servient tenement concerning a damaged staircase. The court refused to impose such a positive obligation stating:
<QUOTE><P>An obligation on the owner of the servient tenement to perform work on it would be inconsistent with the nature of an easement which as regards the servient owner <UNDER>is always negative</UNDER>, the obligation on him being either to suffer or not to do something. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1966] S.C.R. 162</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>25. The justification for the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> is based on the basic common law principle that a person who is not privy to an agreement cannot be bound by it. That liabilities cannot be assigned without the consent of the party to whom the obligation is owed continues to be recognized and is well entrenched in our common law tradition.</P>
<P>26. This Court has followed the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> on multiple occasions. In <CASEREF><SOC>Nordin v. Faridi</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court applied the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> to allow an appeal by a servient tenement owner because the trial judge had, in interpreting an easement, imposed an obligation to share the cost of a well system on the servient tenement. The court set aside the trial judge's orders and held:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>It is an essential characteristic of an easement that it does not place on the owner of the servient tenement any obligation to act.</UNDER> Such an obligation can only be imposed by a positive covenant, the burden of which will not pass with the land. As a result the owner of the servient tenement has no obligation to maintain a right-of-way or, as the law is generally understood, to keep in repair a building in respect of which there is an easement of support.</P>
<P>[...] <UNDER>it is impossible to burden land (as opposed to the landowner) with any positive obligations</UNDER> owed towards the neighbouring land.</P>
<P>[...]to interpret the easement agreement in such a manner as to impose a positive obligation on the servient tenement to provide and maintain a water system would be inconsistent with the jurisprudence regarding the nature of an easement. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nordin v. Faridi</SOC><CITE>[1996] B.C.J. No. 61</CITE><COURTJUR>BC CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, para 34 and 41.</P1></P>
<P>27. This Court later described the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> and negative covenants as follows in <EM>Westbank</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>The covenant must be negative in substance and constitute a burden on the covenantor's land analogous to an easement. <UNDER>No personal or affirmative covenant requiring the expenditure of money or the doing of some act can, apart from statute, be made to run with the land</UNDER>. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Westbank Holdings Ltd. v. Westgate Shopping Centre Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 BCCA 268</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>28. Chief Justice Finch, as he then was, followed <EM>Westbank</EM> in <CASEREF><SOC>Aquadel Golf Course Limited v. Lindell Beach Holiday Resort Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> In that case, the lower court had held that the obligation to maintain land as a golf course was a negative covenant. The Court of Appeal concluded that the covenant was positive and thus, unenforceable. Chief Justice Finch wrote:
<QUOTE><P>A positive covenant does not run with the land, and its character is not altered by registration as a charge in the Land Title Office.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aquadel Golf v. Lindell Beach Holiday Resort</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 5</CITE><PARANUM>4 &amp; 9</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>29. The Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Amberwood</EM> considered whether exceptions should be made to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule and concluded that they should not. Justice Louise Charron, then of the Ontario Court of Appeal, wrote the following for the majority:
<QUOTE><P>The rule that positive covenants do not run with the land has been a settled principle of the English common law for well over a century and it is undisputed that it has clearly been adopted in Canada: <CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson v. Reid</SOC><CITE>1966 CanLII 4</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1966] S.C.R. 162</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>56 D.L.R. (2d) 315</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>. It appears to be equally undisputed that the rule at times causes inconvenience, that its application in some cases may even result in unfairness, and that the present state of the law should be modified to meet the needs of modern conveyancing. However, <UNDER>it is my view that the call for reform is not one for the courts to answer but for the legislature. Any change in the law in this area could have complex and far-reaching effects that cannot be accurately assessed on a case-by-case basis. The need to preserve certainty in commercial and property transactions requires that any meaningful reform be achieved by legislation that can be drafted with careful regard to the consequences</UNDER>. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Durham Condominium Corporation No. 123 v. Amberwood Investments Limited</SOC><CITE>2002 CanLII 44913</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>30. This conclusion was recently affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Black v. Owen</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 397</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>31. The Supreme Court of Canada very recently in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> summarized the principles underlying the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[25] The idea of a payment obligation running with land is by its nature unusual. In fact, <UNDER>it is undisputed that at common law, positive covenants cannot run with the land</UNDER>. This rule is founded on the principle that at common law, a person cannot be made liable upon a contract unless he or she was party to it. [Citations Omitted; Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Heritage Capital Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>32. The <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> applies because the Respondent was not a party to the Easement Agreement and never agreed to assume the obligations of the Easement Agreement. Therefore, it is not possible under common law for the positive covenants in the Easement Agreement to be enforceable against the strata corporation or its owners.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>Exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> may only come from statute</TI>
<P>33. The Ontario Court of Appeal, Alberta Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada have all confirmed that the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> applies despite an express intention to the contrary in an agreement. The Supreme Court of Canada held:
<QUOTE><P>The rule against positive covenants running with the land applies even if an agreement contains an express intention to the contrary (<CASEREF><SOC>Amberwood Investments Ltd. v. Durham Condominium Corp. No. 123</SOC><YEAR>2002</YEAR><CITE>2002 CanLII 44913</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>58 O.R.

<P>34. In <EM>Heritage Capital</EM> the court considered <EM>Amberwood</EM> and <EM>Westbank</EM> and emphasized that the only exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> recognized in law must come from statute:
<QUOTE><P>...the common law rule is that &ldquo;[n]o personal or affirmative covenant, requiring the expenditure of money or the doing of some act, can, <UNDER>apart from statute</UNDER>, be made to run with the land&rdquo; (V. Di Castri, Registration of Title to Land (loose-leaf), vol. 1, at p. 10&ndash;4 (emphasis added), quoted in <CASEREF><SOC>Westbank Holdings Ltd. v. Westgate Shopping Centre Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 BCCA 268 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>155 B.C.A.C. 1</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, at para. 16).</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Heritage Capital</EM>, para 2.</P1></P>
<P>35. It is important to note the underlining in the passage above from <EM>Heritage Capitol</EM> is original. The Supreme Court emphasized that positive covenants can only run with the land under statute.</P>
<P>36. The Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed this interpretation of <EM>Heritage Capitol</EM> in <CASEREF><SOC>Black v. Owen</SOC></CASEREF>. In that case, the plaintiff sought to enforce positive covenants in a trust deed for the payment of the maintenance of certain lands and roadways. The defendants argued that the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule applied. The lower court ruled in favour of the plaintiff by applying the exceptions to Austerberry that the Appellant in this case wants to apply here. The Court of Appeal granted the appeal, finding that the exceptions would run contrary to the majority in <EM>Amberwood</EM> and <EM>Heritage Capitol</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>The majority decision in <EM>Amberwood</EM> remains good law in Ontario. Recently, in <EM>Heritage Capital</EM>, the Supreme Court cited <EM>Amberwood</EM>, at para. 25, for the proposition that the positive covenants rule applies &ldquo;even if an agreement contains an express intention to the contrary&rdquo;. The Court went on to state: &ldquo;As a result, the common law rule is that &lsquo;[n]o personal or affirmative covenant, requiring the expenditure of money or the doing of some act can, <UNDER>apart from statute</UNDER>, be made to run with the land&rsquo;&rdquo; (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</P>
<P><EM>Amberwood</EM> was directly relevant to the matters in issue before the Appeal Judge. It was also a precedent binding on her. Absent reconsideration by this court of its decision in <EM>Amberwood</EM>, (which is not requested by the parties), or an authoritative pronouncement by the Supreme Court of Canada that displaces the majority's holdings in <EM>Amberwood</EM> (which not only has not occurred, <UNDER>but would run contrary to <EM>Heritage Capital</EM></UNDER>), it was not open to the Appeal Judge to disregard the binding majority opinion in <EM>Amberwood</EM> and, instead, to adopt and follow the minority opinion in that case. She erred in law in so doing. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>37. Paragraph 25 of the reasons from <EM>Heritage Capitol</EM> explains why only statute can create and exception to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule:
<QUOTE><P>[25] The idea of a payment obligation running with land is by its nature unusual. In fact, it is undisputed that at common law, positive covenants cannot run with the land. This rule is founded on the principle that at common law, a person cannot be made liable upon a contract unless he or she was party to it. [Citations Omitted]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. That any exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule should be left to the legislatures is sensible as reform in this area requires extreme caution and should not be approached on a case by case basis.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI>The Court Should Not Adopt Exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM></TI>
<P>39. The Appellant seeks to reform the common law to accept the conditional grant and the benefit and burden exception. In the alternative, the Appellant seeks recognition and the application of the conditional grant principal recognized in <EM>Amblewood</EM>. This factum will deal with the exceptions first.</P>
<P>40. No court in Canada has ever recognized the exceptions in any binding decision.</P>
<P>41. The Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Black v. Owen</SOC></CASEREF> confirmed that the exceptions do not form part of the law in Ontario at paragraph 6:
<QUOTE><P>For lengthy reasons it explained, including the uncertainties and many frailties of the existing common law in England in this area of the law, the majority in <UNDER><EM>Amberwood</EM> concluded that it would be inadvisable to adopt the benefit and burden exception</UNDER> to the rule about positive covenants in Ontario. <UNDER>For essentially the same reasons, although perhaps not as explicitly, the majority also declined to import the conditional grant exception</UNDER> as discussed in the English jurisprudence into Ontario law, holding, in any event, that it was not available on the facts to assist the defaulting landowner. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>42. The Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Amberwood</EM> rejected the exceptions on the basis that the exceptions were &ldquo;subject to of much debate and criticism&rdquo; in England (paras 66&ndash;72) and because changes to the common law would create &ldquo;unmanageable confusion&rdquo; and therefore, should be left to the legislatures.
<P1><EM>Amberwood</EM>, paras. 75-76.</P1></P>
<P>43. Far from endorsing a condition grant or benefit and burden exception in <EM>obiter</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson et al. v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1966] SCR 162</CITE></CASEREF> refused to adopt the principle. Instead, the Court dismissed the ground on the basis that even if it assumed the principal existed, it would not apply.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Parkinson et al. v. Reid</SOC><CITE>[1966] SCR 162</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>44. Before reforming the common law, this Court must also consider the unanimous decision of <EM>Friedmann</EM> in which the Supreme Court of Canada considered the three circumstances when it is appropriate to reform the common law:
<QUOTE><P>[42] Before examining whether the criticisms raised above merit the abolition of the sealed contract rule, it is necessary to understand the principles which govern judicial reform of the common law. In the past, this Court has considered the conditions which must be present to effect a change in the common law in several cases. From these cases, some general principles have emerged. A change in the common law <UNDER>must be necessary to keep the common law in step with the evolution of society, to clarify a legal principle, or to resolve an inconsistency. In addition, the change should be incremental, and its consequences must be capable of assessment.</UNDER></P>
<P>[43] ...On the other hand, courts will not intervene where the proposed change will have complex and far-reaching effects, setting the law on an unknown course whose ramifications cannot be accurately measured: see <EM>Bow Valley</EM>, supra, at para. 93. The rationale for judicial restraint in making changes to the common law was expressed by McLachlin J. (as she then was) in Watkins, supra, as follows, at p. 760:
<QUOTE><P>The court may not be in the best position to assess the deficiencies of the existing law, much less problems which may be associated with the changes it might make. The court has before it a single case; major changes in the law should be predicated on a wider view of how the rule will operate in the broad generality of cases. Moreover, the court may not be in a position to appreciate fully the economic and policy issues underlying the choice it is asked to make. [Citations Omitted; Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2000] 1 S.C.R. 842</CITE><PARANUM>42-43</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>45. None of the three circumstances for a change of the common law apply in this case. The change is not necessary to clarify a legal principle or to resolve an inconsistency. The <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> and its limited statutory exceptions are clearly defined in Canada.</P>
<P>46. Concerning the final circumstance regarding societal changes, Justice McLachlin's (as she then was) called for caution at paragraph 46 of <EM>Friedmann</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>[46] While our common law rules must be in step with the evolution of society as a whole, when examining a proposed change to a rule of property or contract law, we must also examine whether the rule is consistent or inconsistent with commercial reality. A rule may have a rationale which appears to be anachronistic while continuing to serve a useful commercial purpose. Our common law is replete with artificial rules which, although they may appear to have no underlying rationale, promote efficiency or security in commercial transactions. Such rules, in the circumstances where they apply, must be followed to create a legally recognized and enforceable right or obligation. Parties, therefore, structure their relations with these rules in mind and the rules themselves become part of commercial reality. Commercial relations may evolve in such a way that a particular rule may become unjust and cumbersome, and may no longer serve its original purpose. When the hardship which a rule causes becomes so acute and <UNDER>widespread</UNDER> that it outweighs any purpose that it may have once served, it is certainly open to a court to make an incremental change in the law. However, <UNDER>there must be evidence of a change in commercial reality which makes such a change in the common law necessary.</UNDER> [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>47. A more than century old and well-entrenched principle of property law should not be altered without the ability to consider the broad ramifications it may cause.</P>
<P>48. The Respondents did not offer any evidence to suggest that there has been a widespread change in commercial reality that would justify changing the common law in the way they have proposed, particularly in the strata context.</P>
<P>49. If anything, the opposite is true. The affidavit of Mr. De Vuyst acknowledges that a legislative solution for cost sharing in a multi-use building already exists under the SPA. The Appellant just preferred the ASP model because it wanted to avoid the protections that the SPA provides. As the Chambers Judge noted at paragraph 169 of her Reasons:
<QUOTE><P>The respondent could have used the <EM>SPA's</EM> separate sections model, but chose not to because it did not want the residential strata owners to overwhelm the others owners in a mixed-use building.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>50. The Appellant's aversion to the democratic protections of the SPA does not amount to evidence of commercial necessity.</P>
<P>51. In its 2012 <EM>Report on Restrictive Covenants</EM>, a committee of the British Columbia Law Institute (BCLI) concluded that reform of the law in this area should be approached with caution:
<QUOTE><P>The matter needs to be approached nevertheless with some caution, because positive obligations are often more onerous than negative ones. A covenant not to build more than one dwelling per lot is easily performed, and a purchaser of property subject to the covenants is not exposed to any greater detriment than the vendor who has performed the covenant by not putting a second building on the property. If the covenant is to maintain and repair works or structures on the property, however, a purchaser cannot be certain of what the future cost of compliance will be.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>BCLI Report, p. 29.</P1></P>
<P>52. Like the example given by the BCLI committee, the strata corporation, in this case, has little certainty of what future costs JHV will seek to impose on it for the parkade, other than the fact that JHV will seek 80% of whatever they may be from the Respondent.</P>
<P>53. The BCLI committee concluded that a change to allow positive covenants should be implemented through the enactment of legislation. One concern that the committee expressed was that landowners should not suddenly find themselves liable under positive covenants entered into by their predecessors in title:
<QUOTE><P>... the change would only apply to positive covenants entered into after the enactment of legislation implementing this proposal. In this way, landowners who do not bear any liability now under positive covenants made in the past by their predecessors in title would not become instantly subject to springing liabilities.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>BCLI Report, page x.</P1></P>
<P>54. A sudden reform of the law in this area by the courts on a case by case basis would likely give rise to the &ldquo;springing liabilities&rdquo; that so concerned the BCLI committee. This is a strong reason for the courts to show restraint in this area. Parties subject to real estate transactions in Canada have structured their dealings by the more than 100-year-old <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM>. It would be harsh for land owners to suddenly find that they are subject to positive covenants on title which they never agreed to and never thought would apply to them.</P>
<P>55. The court should be particularly wary of introducing exceptions on a case-by-case basis in the strata context. The SPA already has statutory exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> rule. These exceptions exist to force the repair of strata property and fund common expenses. For example, strata corporations can collect funds from owners to pay for common expenses (SPA, s. 92) and owners must repair and maintain their strata lots (SPA, Standard Bylaw 2(1)). These obligations that run with the land have been crafted so that they are subject to a democratic system of governance where owners have a say in the expenses and obligations they incur.
<P1><EM>Strata Property Act</EM> [SBC 1998] C.43.</P1></P>
<P>56. Cost sharing agreements with third parties of the kind created by JHV are not contemplated in the SPA. They are also contrary to the usual democratic and accountable way in which common costs are decided and imposed on strata owners.</P>
<P>57. The Appellant was uncomfortable with the owners of Jameson House having a say in, among other things, the management, maintenance, and funding of the parkade under the democratic process of the SPA. Instead, JHV created its own alternative model based on a 231-page adhesion contract in the form of an easement.</P>
<P>58. It is easy to contemplate, how such cost-sharing agreements can be subject to abuse, particularly in BC. Unlike in other jurisdictions, the SPA does not specifically contemplate their use and has no specific protections in place for strata lot purchasers. By contrast, in Ontario, ss. 111&ndash;113 of the <EM>Condominium Act, 1998</EM>, S.O. 1998, c. 19 provides specific protections and remedies regarding contracts concerning the mutual use of shared facilities between condo owners and third parties put in place by the owner developer.</P>
<P>59. One of the objectives of the SPA is consumer protection against developers. The deposit of the strata plan in the Land Title Office brings the strata corporation into existence, but until the first general meeting, the owner developer controls the strata corporation under ss. 5&ndash;8 of the SPA. Before the first conveyance, an owner developer has broader powers than even an elected strata council, including the right to pass resolutions without a general meeting (s. 8). With these expansive powers, it is possible that owner-developers may attempt to bind strata corporations to unfavorable contracts in favour of their own interests, including onerous cost-sharing agreements.</P>
<P>60. Section 6(1) of the SPA is the sole protection for future owners against an owner developer that might seek to ameliorate its own position at the expense of the strata corporation:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>6.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><TI>Owner developer's standard of care</TI>
<SSECP>In exercising the powers and performing the duties of a council, the owner developer must
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the strata corporation, and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>exercise the care, diligence and skill of a reasonably prudent person in comparable circumstances.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. If the Appeal is granted, this Court would allow the Appellant and other developers to skirt the protections of s. 6 because the strata corporation's assumption of the positive covenants registered before the creation of the strata corporation would not be required. Unscrupulous developers could do a great deal of mischief to strata lot purchasers if the court paved the way for them to register positive covenants on title that would be excepted from both the <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> and s. 6 of the SPA.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>A Strata Corporation cannot be subject to obligations that run with land</TI>
<P>62. The strata corporation represents the owners in this matter. The individual owners that the strata corporation represents in this matter are not bound by the positive covenants of the Easement Agreement because they never assumed them.</P>
<P>63. The strata corporation itself is not bound for the same reason and because it is incapable of being bound by an obligation that runs with the land.</P>
<P>64. A strata corporation cannot be subject to any obligation that runs with land because the strata corporation does not own any land.</P>
<P>65. Under s. 66 of the <EM>SPA</EM> the individual owners of the strata corporation own all the common property and common assets as tenants in common. The strata corporation merely manages the common property and common assets for the benefit of the owners under ss. 3 and 72 of the SPA.</P>
<P>66. That the owners, not the strata corporation, own all the real property on the strata plan was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Ball</SOC><CITE>2006 BCCA 243</CITE><PARANUM>3</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>67. The exceptions to the Austerberry Rule advocated by the Appellant would allow a positive covenant to run with land. However, the notion that a strata corporation can be bound by an obligation that runs with land is contrary to the nature of how strata property is owned. Thus, the strata corporation by its very nature cannot be subject to an obligation that is based on the ownership of land.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>H.</N><TI>The Conditional Grant Principle Should Not Be Adopted</TI>
<P>68. The Chambers Judge refused to adopt the conditional grant principle recognized by the Ontario Court of Appeal at paragraphs 85-86 of <EM>Amberwood</EM> but held that even if she did, it would not apply in this case.
<P1>Reasons for Judgement, para. 171&ndash;176. A.R., pp. 66-67.</P1></P>
<P>69. This Court should affirm that decision and refuse to adopt the principle.</P>
<P>70. Adoption of the principle would create uncertainty in the law. Counsel in this case and others have struggled to give examples of where this principle would practically apply or how it is in any way distinguishable from the common law exceptions <EM>Austerberry Rule</EM> that have been rejected by the Courts in Canada.</P>
<P>71. In <CASEREF><SOC>Strata Plan NWS 3457 v Strata Plan LMS 1425</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1346</CITE></CASEREF>, Mr. Justice Branch confessed great difficulty in deriving a principled distinction between the rejected &ldquo;conditional grant exception&rdquo; and the &ldquo;conditional grant principle.&rdquo; He held that:
<QUOTE><P>While the Ontario Court of Appeal has apparently sought to preserve some room for interpreting the grant of a positive easement in a way that sustains it, if the grant is sufficiently tied to the positive condition, <UNDER>I find that the adoption of this approach into B.C. law is not justified, and would introduce too much uncertainty into the law</UNDER>. The struggles that experienced counsel had before me drawing a distinction between the rejection of the conditional grant exception and accepting an exception when the grant is sufficiently conditional, only highlights the uncertainty that would be created if the <EM>Amberwood</EM> exception were adopted as proposed. Plaintiff's counsel conceded that he was not aware of any case where a party had successfully applied the <EM>Amberwood</EM> exception for the benefit of the party owed obligations under a positive grant. This lack of authority makes it even more difficult to accept the proposed exception, given the lack of established principles as to how and when it could be applied. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Strata Plan NWS 3457 v Strata Plan LMS 1425</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1346</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>72. Such a confused principle should also not form part of the law in Canada because it would allow parties to create obligations in easements that the courts have repeatedly said are contrary to the very nature of an easement.</P>
<P>73. However, if the Court does adopt the principle, then the Court should affirm the Chambers Judge's interpretation of the easement that the principle does not apply at paragraph 175 of her Reasons for Judgement:
<QUOTE><P>Nowhere does the Easement Agreement provide that the right to use the parkade is conditional upon the acceptance of the burden contained in the positive covenant that contemplates the cost-sharing of expenses to operate the parkade.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>74. This interpretation of the contract by the Chambers Judge is owed deference on appeal and is also correct.</P>
<P>75. The Easement Agreement does not make the grant of parking rights conditional on the continuing payment of the &ldquo;Parkade Charges.&rdquo; The consideration for the grant is expressly stated to be the consideration received from the individual strata lot owners when they purchased their units as per Article 5.3.1.</P>
<P>76. The benefit of the right to park is granted to the &ldquo;Residential Parkade Users&rdquo; which is defined in Article 5.3 of the Easement Agreement as the &ldquo;Air Space Parcel 1 Owner and its Strata Corporation&rdquo;. By contrast &ldquo;individual Strata Unit Owners&rdquo; are the ones that gave consideration for the granting of the Easement Agreement according to Article 5.3.1.</P>
<P>77. According to Article 5.3.7 and 5.3.8, the obligation to pay parkade charges falls on the &ldquo;Residential Parkade Users&rdquo; and not the &ldquo;individual Strata Unit Owners&rdquo;.</P>
<P>78. The grant of the easement was a separate transaction under consideration granted by different parties and is, therefore, independent of the alleged obligation to pay parkade charges.</P>
<P>79. The Respondent also did not assume the obligation to pay 80% of the parkade costs as a part of the transaction described in Article 5.3.1. Under the terms of the easement, the Respondent would be billed by the Remainder owner regardless of whether consideration was received by the &ldquo;individual Strata Unit Owners&rdquo;; the extent of the use of the APSS by the &ldquo;individual Strata Unit Owners&rdquo;; or if the &ldquo;individual Strata Unit Owners&rdquo; ceased using the parkade all together.</P>
<P>80. Even the English exceptions advocated by the Appellant do not apply in those circumstances. As noted by the learned author in <EM>Preston &amp; Newsom's Restrictive</EM> Covenants <EM>(10th Ed.):</EM>
<QUOTE><P>The benefit and burden <UNDER>must be conferred in or by the same transaction</UNDER> and be relevant to one another, <UNDER>and the person on whom the burden is alleged to have been imposed must have, or have had, the opportunity of rejecting or disclaiming the benefit, not merely the right to receive it.</UNDER> [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Preston &amp; Newsom's Restrictive Covenants (10th Ed.), p. 105.</P1></P>
<P>81. As Justice Charron, as she then was, noted at paragraph 69 of <EM>Amberwood</EM> the House of Lords &ldquo;rejected any notion of a &ldquo;pure principle of benefit and burden&rdquo; that would bind successors to burdens that stood independently of the right.&rdquo;</P>
<P>82. There are no provisions in the easement which would purportedly relieve the strata corporation of its alleged ob ligation to pay for the 80% of the parkade costs even if some or all of the owners ceased to access the parkade. Thus, the burden stands independent of the right and cannot be said to be conditional on each other.</P>
<P>83. The principle described in <EM>Amberwood</EM> can also not be based on general language or vague statements of intent that the Appellants have relied on in their interpretation of the easement. Otherwise, as the Court in <EM>Amberwood</EM> noted:
<QUOTE><P>[87] ...it would be open to anyone to simply abolish the [<EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule] at the stroke of a pen. All that would be required would be a general statement of intent that the continuing right to the use and enjoyment of all the benefits in an agreement was conditional upon the acceptance of the burden contained in any of the covenants. The recognition of such a wide exception would constitute a profound change in the law.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI><UNDER>Introduction</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The rigid application of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule can no longer be justified. According to the <EM>Report on Restrictive Covenants</EM> published by the British Columbia Law Institute:
<QUOTE><P>In British Columbia as elsewhere, courts have routinely applied the requirement [that only negative covenants may run with the land] on the basis of previous authority without attempting to justify it. Judicial reluctance to relax the requirement of negativity has been described as &ldquo;a phobic response to entering new terrain&rdquo;... An examination of the merits of allowing positive covenants to run with the land is overdue. (p. 23)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>2. The Appellant does not seek a &ldquo;drastic&rdquo; change to the common law, or to &ldquo;overturn&rdquo; the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. The Appellant asks the court to recognize common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule that have been applied in England (the historical home of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule) and, to some extent, in Ontario for many years. The modifications proposed are more consistent with the decision in <EM>Austerberry</EM> than the rigid application of the rule extracted from the decision.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>The Court Should Not Be Reluctant to Modify the Common Law</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. The Court of Appeal should not be reluctant to make incremental changes to the common law when it is appropriate to do so. The common law is intended to change over time when there are sound policy reasons for the proposed change or to bring legal rules into step with a changing society. The principle of <EM>stare decisis</EM> is not meant to be a &ldquo;straitjacket&rdquo; that prohibits appropriate changes to the common law.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Rosas v. Toca</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 191</CITE><PARANUM>171-172</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI><UNDER>A Change to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule Is Necessary</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. <EM>Friedmann</EM> suggests that a change in the common law may be necessary to keep the common law in step of the evolution of society or to resolve an inconsistency. Any change should be incremental and the consequences of that change should be capable of assessment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Friedmann and Equity Developments Inc v. Final Note Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2000 SCC 34</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>5. Much has changed since the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule was developed. Land ownership is far more integrated, with people living closer together and sharing facilities and amenities. Most importantly, land registration systems are far more reliable and accessible, which undermines the foundation for the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule needs to be modified to keep up with changes to society and commercial realties.</P>
<P>6. The <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule is based on privity of contract. It was intended to protect a purchaser who acquired a property without knowledge of an obligation to pay. That is no longer a realistic risk.</P>
<P>7. In <EM>Stare Decisis and Positive Covenants and Easements: An Inconvenient Straitjacket, The Advocate</EM> Vol. 76, September 2018, Richard Olson explains why the foundation for the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule no longer exists:
<QUOTE><P>If there is such a rule&mdash;and courts today seem to think that there is&mdash;it arose at a time, and in a setting, when title to land and other interests in land arose through deeds. A purchaser might well acquire the fee simple title to the property only to learn later that the title was burdened with an easement or restrictive covenant of which the purchaser had no notice. ...</P>
<P>As to the current circumstances, today, in British Columbia and many other provinces, most interests affecting land are required to be registered in the land title office so that any purchaser has actual notice of them. Why was the land title system adopted? To provide an assurance of title so that a purchaser of land would not be surprised by the appearance of a charge or other interest affecting a parcel of land that might have been missed when a review of the deeds relevant to the purchase was performed. (p.676 - 677)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. This case illustrates the vanishing foundation for the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. Here, the requirement to pay the Parkade Expenses was disclosed to potential purchasers both by registration of the Easement Agreement in the Land Title Registry, and in disclosure statements filed with the Financial Institutions Commission. Potential purchasers were also alerted to the Parkade Expenses because the strata bylaws stated that the strata corporation was bound by the Easement Agreement. No purchaser was at risk of accidentally taking on an unknown obligation.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>d)</N><TI><UNDER>The Five Factors Are Present</UNDER></TI>
<P>9. In <EM>Friedmann</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada set out five factors that might identify &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; reasons for reform:
<QUOTE><P>These factors were the existence of previous dissenting opinions in this Court, a trend in the provincial appellate courts to depart from the principles adopted in the original decision, criticism of the case or adoption of a contrary rule in other jurisdictions, doctrinal criticism of the case and its foundations, and inconsistency of the case with other decisions. While they are not prerequisites for a change in the common law, these factors help to identify compelling reasons for reform.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Friedmann</EM>, para 43</P1></P>
<P>10. The factors identified in <EM>Friedmann</EM> are present:
<P1>(a) although there are not dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court of Canada (because it has not specifically considered the issue), there was a strong dissent in <EM>Amberwood</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(b) the Ontario Court of Appeal has departed, at least to some extent, from a rigid application of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule by accepting the conditional grant principle;</P1>
<P1>(c) there has been widespread criticism of the rigid application of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule in other countries and other countries have adopted common law or statutory exceptions to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule;</P1>
<P1>(d) there is widespread criticism of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule in Canada, as well as long-standing calls for reforms to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule; and</P1>
<P1>(e) the recent decisions of the Supreme Court of British Columbia are inconsistent with the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Amberwood</EM> and <CASEREF><SOC>Black v. Owen</SOC></CASEREF>.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>e)</N><TI><UNDER>There Is No Good Reason to Maintain the Status Quo</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. Given that the foundation for the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule no longer exists, there is no good reason to refuse to modify the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule to relieve its harsh consequences.</P>
<P>12. &ldquo;Fidelity&rdquo; to a common law principle is not a convincing policy reason to maintain that principle:
<QUOTE><P>... It is &ldquo;revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV,&rdquo; and &ldquo;still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule persists from blind imitation of the past.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bank of Montreal v. Dynex Petroleum Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2002] 1 S.C.R. 146</CITE><PARANUM>18 -19</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>13. That is especially so when limiting language in the decision in <EM>Austerberry</EM> has been ignored in favour of a rigid and all encompassing rule.
<P1><EM>Olson</EM>, p. 675&ndash;678</P1></P>
<P>14. The arguments of the Respondent do not survive scrutiny:
<P1>(a) it is irrelevant that the Appellant could have developed the property using a strata model, rather than an air space model. Both models have advantages and disadvantages. The choice of model should not be dictated by the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule;</P1>
<P1>(b) the modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule proposed by the Appellant are unlikely to create &ldquo;springing liabilities&rdquo; on people who have organized their affairs in accordance with the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule. The common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule will protect and enforce the reasonable expectations of the parties to an easement. Anyone who organizes their affairs to take advantage of the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule by, for example, acquiring property with the express intention of obtaining the benefit of an easement without the corresponding burden of paying costs associated with it, is unworthy of protection; and</P1>
<P1>(c) there is no credible reason to believe that allowing common law modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule will cause predatory developers to impose unfair cost-sharing agreements on strata owners. Any cost-sharing agreements would have to be disclosed to potential purchasers, which would prevent developers from selling units in a development that had an exploitive cost-sharing regime; and</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>f)</N><TI><UNDER>Conclusion</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. The modifications to the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule proposed by the Appellant are incremental, not &ldquo;drastic&rdquo;. The Appellant does not seek to &ldquo;overturn&rdquo; the <EM>Austerberry</EM> Rule, but rather to modify it in a manner consistent with the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal, the English courts and the original decision in <EM>Austerberry</EM>.</P>
<P>16. As Mr. Olson comments:
<QUOTE><P>Under the current view of the law these easements only bind the original parties to the positive obligations (repair, contribution to operating and repair costs and taxes among them) contractually. Subsequent purchasers are not bound and yet are entitled to the benefit of the easement. This seems on any view to be an absurd result, especially since if the agreement had been assumed by the strata corporation, then it would have been enforceable. Why this should be so when the foundation on which the rule in <EM>Austerberry</EM> is based, is so faulty and out of date remains a mystery. Stasis indeed. (p. 678)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<P>I, Garth S. McAlister, Barrister and Solicitor, of 203-1807 Fir Street, Vancouver, British Columbia make oath and say as follows:</P>
<P>1. I am counsel for the Appellant, Jameson House Ventures Ltd. in this appeal. As such I have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I swear this affidavit in support of an application for an order that this Appeal be heard and determined by the same division of this Court as the following two Appeals:
<P1>a. Court of Appeal File No. CA44250 between The Owners, Strata Plan LMS3905 as Respondent and Crystal Square Parking Corporation as Appellant (the &ldquo;Crystal Square Appeal&rdquo;), and</P1>
<P1>b. Court of Appeal File No. File No. CA44684between The Owners, Strata Plan NWS 3457 as Appellant and The Owners, Strata Plan LMS 1425 as Respondent (the &ldquo;Scottsdale Village Appeal&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>I will refer to this Appeal, the Crystal Square Appeal in the Scottsdale Village Appeal collectively as the &ldquo;Three Appeals&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>3. The status of this Appeal is as follows:
<P1>a. The Notice of Appeal was filed on November 16, 2017;</P1>
<P1>b. A Notice of Appearance was filed on November 17, 2017;</P1>
<P1>c. The Appeal Record was filed on January 12, 2018;</P1>
<P1>d. Joint Appeal Books are in the process of being finalized and will be filed shortly.</P1></P>
<P>4. I am informed by Emily Kirkpatrick, who is one of the counsel for the Appellant in the Crystal Square Appeal, that the status of the Crystal Square Appeal is as follows:
<P1>a. The Notice of Appeal was filed on February 15, 2017;</P1>
<P1>b. The Notice of Appearance was filed on February 16, 2017;</P1>
<P1>c. The Appellant filed its factum on July 12, 2017;</P1>
<P1>d. The Respondent filed its factum on September 11, 2017;</P1>
<P1>e. No date has yet been set for the hearing of this appeal.</P1></P>
<P>5. I am informed by James Klassen, who is counsel for the Respondent in the Scottsdale Village Appeal, that the status of the Scottsdale Village Appeal is as follows:
<P1>a. The Notice of Appeal was filed on August 22, 2017;</P1>
<P1>b. The Notice of Appearance was filed on September 1, 2017;</P1>
<P1>c. No Appeal Record has been filed, nor have Appeal Books been filed.</P1></P>
<P>6. I am informed by Stephen Hamilton, who is counsel for the Respondent in the Crystal Square Appeal and for the Appellant in the Scottsdale Village Appeal that he will not be continuing as counsel for the Appellant in the Scottsdale Village Appeal and that the Appellant in that appeal is looking to retain other counsel.</P>
<P>7. Now produced and shown to me:
<P1>a. As <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the factum filed on behalf of the Appellant in the Crystal Square Appeal;</P1>
<P1>b. As <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Reasons for Judgement of Madam Justice Donegan pronounced November 2, 2017 in relation to this Appeal;</P1>
<P1>c. As <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Reasons for Judgement of Madam Justice Young pronounced January 17, 2017 in relation to the Crystal Square Appeal;</P1>
<P1>d. As <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Reasons for Judgement of Mr. Justice Branch pronounced August 2, 2017 in relation to the Scottsdale Village Appeal.</P1></P>
<P>8. It is apparent from the Reasons for Judgment underlying each of the three Appeals that a legal conclusion common to all three is that courts in Canada, and in particular courts in British Columbia, do not recognize exceptions to the general rule that positive covenants do not run with the land.</P>
<P>9. That legal conclusion is directly challenged by the Appellant as a ground of appeal in the Crystal Square Appeal, and a similar challenge will be one of the grounds of appeal in this Appeal. It is my understanding, although I am not sure, that such a challenge will also be a ground of appeal in the Scottsdale Village Appeal.</P>
<P>10. I swear this affidavit in support of an application that the Three Appeals be heard and determined by the same division of this Court (the &ldquo;Order Sought&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. There have been discussions between the lawyers for the parties in all Three Appeals about them being heard and determined by the same division of this Court and, for the purposes of this application, I have communicated with each of them asking whether their respective clients would be prepared to consent to the Order Sought.</P>
<P>12. I am informed by:
<P1>a. Alex Chang, who is one of the counsel representing the Respondent in this Appeal, that the Respondent consents to the Order Sought;</P1>
<P1>b. Stephen Hamilton that:
<P2>i. As counsel for the Respondent in the Crystal Square Appeal, the Respondent in that appeal consents to the Order Sought;</P2>
<P2>ii. He does not have instructions to consent to the Order Sought on behalf of the Appellant in the Scottsdale Village Appeal because he will not be continuing as counsel in that appeal;</P2></P1>
<P1>c. Emily Fitzpatrick, who is one of the counsel representing the Appellant in the Crystal Square Appeal, that the Order Sought &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>13. I have asked for but not yet received the consent to the Order Sought from James Klassen, who is counsel for the Respondent in the Scottsdale Village Appeal.</P>
<P>14. In addition to serving the Respondent in this appeal, we will be serving the application materials on the parties to the Crystal Square and the Scottsdale Village Appeals and, if the Court grants the Order Sought, we will also be asking the Court to order that a consent order to the same effect as the Order Sought may be filed in each of the Crystal Square Appeal and the Scottsdale Village Appeal.</P>
