<P>9. At all material times, Wei provided the above investment funds to Chiu and Lau solely and for the specific purpose of having Chiu use the funds to purchase shares in the above noted companies and markets for and on behalf of Wei.</P>
<P>10. At all materials times, Chiu and Lau were to hold the above funds received from Wei and any investments purchased using those funds in trust and for the sole benefit of Wei.</P>
<P>11. Between July 2015 and August 2016, Wei, Chiu and Lau also entered into various investment agreements with respect to the funds provided by Wei to Chiu and Lau (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Investment Agreements</BOLD>&rdquo;). Pursuant to certain of the Investment Agreements, dated May 16, 2016 and August 10, 2016, Chiu acknowledged and agreed that the funds provided by Wei would be held in trust by Chiu until October 31, 2016.</P>
<P>12. At all material times, in breach of trust, and contrary to the Representations and the terms of the Investment Agreements, Chiu and Lau did not invest the funds they received from Wei and did not provide Wei a return on her investment, but rather converted Wei's funds to their own uses by putting the investment funds to such uses as they saw fit, the particulars of which are best known to Chiu and Lau.</P>
<P>13. Despite demand from Wei for the return of the full amount provided by her to Chiu and Lau, and in breach of their trust obligations to Wei and the Investment Agreements, as of the current date, Chiu and Lau have only returned to Wei USD$34,000 of the principal amounts she provided to them. Chiu and Lau have failed to return to Wei the remainder of the principal amounts she provided to them or pay her any return on those amounts.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Plaintiff's Payment of Commissions and Management Fees</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. Between 2015 and 2016, Wei further provided to Chiu and Lau funds on account of certain management fees and commissions that were purported to be owed under the Investment Agreements by Wei to Chiu and Lau for their assistance in managing the investments purportedly purchased with Wei's funds.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Promissory Note</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. In November 2016, Wei directed Chiu to sell Wei's investments and transfer the funds back to Wei.</P>
<P>16. At that time, Chiu advised Wei that he was unable to sell her investments until April 1, 2017, which was the start of the next tax year.</P>
<P>17. On November 29, 2016, Chiu and Wei executed an agreement wherein Chiu acknowledged that he owed Wei USD$1.25 million, which consisted of the principal amount Wei had provided to Chiu and Lau for investment purposes and some interest (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Promissory Note</BOLD>&rdquo;). It was a term of the Promissory Note that Chiu would repay Wei USD$1.25 million on April 1, 2017.</P>
<P>18. The Promissory Note further provided that Chiu would use as security for the amount he owed to Wei a property he owned at XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>19. From April 1, 2017, with the exception of the USD$34,000 received by Wei, Chiu has failed to pay the principal amount of the Promissory Note, as well as interest on the principal, despite demand.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Defendants' Conspiracy</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. At all material times, Chiu and Lau conspired and/or agreed with each other to induce Wei, and others, to make investments with Chiu and Lau in a fraudulent investment operation run by them.</P>
<P>21. The Representations, the receipt of investment funds in exchange therefor, and the concealment by Chiu and Lau of their fraudulent investment operation were acts committed by Chiu and Lau in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud investors, including Wei.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Damages suffered by the Plaintiff</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. As a result of the Representations that induced Wei to provide funds to Chiu and Lau for the purchase of certain investments, Chiu's and Lau's breach of trust and/or the conversion of Wei's investment, Wei has suffered losses and damages, the particulars of which include, but are not limited to, the following:
<P1>(a) The loss of USD$1,098,767.00 provided to Chiu and Lau for the sole and specific purpose of Chiu using the funds to purchase certain investments on behalf of Wei, less the US$34,000 received by Wei;</P1>
<P1>(b) Lost opportunity cost in not having the funds provided available for other, legitimate investment opportunities;</P1>
<P1>(c) The loss of funds paid by Wei to Chiu and Lau on the mistaken belief that these amount were due by Wei on account of management fees and commissions that were said to be owed under the Investment Agreements;</P1>
<P1>(d) Such further and additional losses and damages as will be proven at the trial of this action.</P1></P>
<P>23. Further, and in the alternative, as a result of Chiu's default under the Promissory Note, Chiu owes Wei the principal, less the US$34,000 received by Wei, plus interest on the Promissory Note, which remains due and payable.</P>
<P>24. The rate for converting US dollars into Canadian dollars on May 11, 2017 was 1.3707. Applying this conversion rate, as of May 11, 2017:
<ITEM><P>USD$1,098,767.00 would be converted into CAD$1,506,079.93; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>USD$1,250,000.00 would be converted into CAD$1,713,375.00.</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Acquisition of Assets by the Defendants using Wei's Funds</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. The use of Wei's funds by the defendants is best known to them and they have fraudulently failed to disclose those uses to Wei.</P>
<P>26. Unbeknownst to Wei, the defendants, in furtherance of a conspiracy, fraudulently converted some or all of Wei's funds by using them to acquire certain assets, the particulars of which are best known to the defendants.</P>
<P>27. Some or all of the funds provided by Wei to Chiu and Lau or the assets traceable therefrom remain in the possession or control of Chiu, Lau, or corporate entities under their control.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>28. The plaintiff claims the sum of CAD$1,506,079.93 on account of the principal amounts provided by Wei to Chiu and Lau;</P>
<P>29. The plaintiff further claims against the defendants, and each of them, for:
<P1>(a) restitution;</P1>
<P1>(b) general damages;</P1>
<P1>(c) special damages;</P1>
<P1>(d) aggravated damages; and</P1>
<P1>(e) punitive damages;</P1></P>
<P>30. The plaintiff claims that the defendants hold funds invested by the plaintiff and any real or personal property or any other assets purchased with such funds obtained from the fraud perpetrated on the plaintiff as constructive trustees or pursuant to a quistclose trust for the benefit of the plaintiff;</P>
<P>31. The plaintiff claims tracing orders against the defendants and third parties compelling them to deliver records relating to the funds invested by the plaintiff and assets acquired by the defendants or in respect to the fraud perpetrated on the plaintiff;</P>
<P>32. The plaintiff claims interlocutory and permanent injunctions, among other things, restraining the defendants, by themselves their servants, agents or otherwise, from disposing of any of their assets, real or personal, pre-judgment attachment orders, pre-judgment garnishment and for orders compelling third parties to provide information with respect to the funds invested by the plaintiff or assets acquired through such funds;</P>
<P>33. The plaintiff claims an order or judgment of this Honourable Court seeking the assistance of those Courts or tribunals in other jurisdictions which the plaintiff learns or discovers is a jurisdiction where the defendant, or one or more of them, have moved the funds invested by the plaintiff, or has assets which can be traced to such funds;</P>
<P>34. The plaintiff claims interest pursuant to the <EM>Court Order Interest Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79;</P>
<P>35. The plaintiff claims special costs, or in the alternative, costs; and</P>
<P>36. The plaintiff claims such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require and this Honourable Court may permit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>37. The plaintiff claims against the defendants, and each of them, on the basis of breach of trust, unjust enrichment, conversion, non-disclosure, breach of contract and fraud, and relies on the common law related thereto.</P>
<P>38. The funds were provided by the plaintiff to the defendants for the sole and specific purpose of the defendants investing the funds on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of a quistclose trust and associated remedies, because, contrary to the specific purpose for which the plaintiff's funds were advanced, the defendants failed to invest the funds on behalf of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>39. The defendants have without lawful excuse retained, converted or used for their own benefit funds belonging to the plaintiff and monies owed to the plaintiff.</P>
<P>40. Each and all of the defendants conspired as aforesaid to defraud the plaintiff of her investments and to convert the plaintiff's investment funds to their own use.</P>
<P>41. The defendants have been unjustly enriched by the receipt, retention and use of the plaintiff's funds, by achieving a benefit which corresponded to a detriment to the plaintiff, for no juristic reason.</P>
<P>42. The Representations made by the defendants to the plaintiff were false and were made knowing that they were false without belief in their truth, or reckless as to whether they were true or false. The Representations were relied on by the plaintiff and induced the plaintiff to invest with the defendants in their fraudulent investment operation thereby causing loss or damage.</P>
<P>43. The defendants, or one of them, received the proceeds of the fraud perpetrated on the plaintiff or acquired assets with such funds with knowledge, actual or constructive, of such fraud. The defendants had knowledge, actual or constructive, of all material facts set out above including, without limitation, the fact that the defendants were running a fraudulent investment operation as set out above.</P>
<P>44. The plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of constructive trust and associated remedies because the defendants obtained funds from the plaintiff through wrongful means, namely, the Representations and their fraudulent investment operation, and those funds can be traced to the acquisition or improvement of assets by the defendants, the particulars of which are known to the defendants.</P>
<P>45. Further, and in the alternative, Chiu has defaulted on the Promissory Note and the plaintiff is entitled to the amount due under the Promissory Note, which remains un paid.</P>

<P1>2. The facts alleged in paragraphs <UNDER>2-3, 5-23 and 25-27</UNDER> of Part 1 of the Notice of Civil Claim are denied.</P1>
<P1>3. The facts alleged in paragraphs <UNDER>24</UNDER> of Part 1 of the Notice of Civil Claim are outside the knowledge of the Defendants.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Division"><N>2</N><TI>Defendants' Version of Facts</TI>
<P><P1>1. Mr. Chiu is retired. Mrs. Chiu is a homemaker. Together, they have resided in rental premise at XXXXXXXXXX since 2013. They been residents of Canada since 2010 and are both Canadian citizens.</P1>
<P1>2. The Plaintiff has a residential address at XXXXXXXXXX as well as a residential address at XXXXXXXXXX, Yi Yuan Ju Xiao Qu, XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX</P1>
<P1>3. The Plaintiff is a citizen of both Canada and the Peoples' Republic of China.</P1>
<P1>4. The Defendants deny that either of them made to the Plaintiff any of the representations as alleged by the Plaintiff in paragraph 5 of the Notice of Civil Claim herein (the &ldquo;NOCC&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>5. The Plaintiff first met the Defendants in or about January 2015 through a tennis club at which their respective children played tennis.</P1>
<P1>6. From their first meeting, the Plaintiff wished to talk to the Defendants almost entirely about her interest in stock trading and other investments and the poor returns she was receiving on her investments. The Defendants had no interest in discussing these subjects with the Plaintiff but the Plaintiff persisted and, at times, the Defendant, Mr. Chiu, listen ed to the Plaintiff only out of politeness. Later, in or about April and May 2015, the Plaintiff sought to develop a friendship with Mrs. Chiu and to use that friendship with Mrs. Chiu to influence and persuade Mr. Chiu to give the Plaintiff some friendly advice as to which stocks or other investments the Plaintiff should consider purchasing.</P1>
<P1>7. At all relevant times between early 2016 and early April 2017, Mr. Chiu and the Plaintiff were willing partners and participants in an intimate romantic and sexual relationship unknown to Mrs. Chiu and the Plaintiff told Mr. Chiu that the relationship was also unknown to the Plaintiff's husband. Mrs. Chiu learned of the relationship between Mr. Chiu and the Plaintiff in late 2016. It is unknown to the Defendants when or if the Plaintiff's husband became aware of the relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu.</P1>
<P1>8. Once the relationship began between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu, the Plaintiff avoided contact with Mrs. Chiu.</P1>
<P1>9. The relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu was more than an extramarital affair. Mr. Chiu was involved in nearly every facet of the Plaintiff's life, including accompanying the Plaintiff on visits to her doctor; meeting with the Plaintiff's son's school principal; meeting with the Plaintiff's daughter's university counsellors; dealing with the Plaintiff's real estate agents with respect to the Plaintiff's properties in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; meeting with the Plaintiff's tax accountants regarding tax planning; as well as discussing and helping the Plaintiff with her stock trading activities, successfully helping her earn over USD$300,000 in profits in the year 2016 as well as other significant trading profits in the period January to April 2017.</P1>
<P1>10. Mr. Chiu did whatever he could to assist the Plaintiff in her life because he and the Plaintiff were in love and Mr. Chiu and the Plaintiff considered each other to be part of each other's families.</P1>
<P1>11. During the relevant time period, the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu were together almost every day and they travelled together to, amongst other places, Singapore where the Plaintiff requested Mr. Chiu to assist the Plaintiff in meeting with lawyers to acquire a British Virgin Islands shelf company, Century Lane Investments Ltd., to shelter assets from Canadian taxation and to Europe for vacation and to investigate potential investment opportunities for the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>12. Following a trip which the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu took together to Singapo re in June 2016, the Plaintiff raised the subject of their living together and she discussed with Mr. Chiu on many occasions their eventually living together. The Plaintiff informed Mr. Chiu that, while she wished to live together with Mr. Chiu, her divorce/separation agreement with her husband prohibited the Plaintiff from cohabiting until the Plaintiff's son had reached the age of 18 and was enrolled in university and Plaintiff did not wish to risk her husband's ceasing to make support payments for her children. In the Autumn of 2016, the Plaintiff discussed with Mr. Chiu and considered purchasing an additional home in Vancouver, close to their respective homes so that the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu would have a private place to meet away from the Plaintiff's home.</P1>
<P1>13. The Plaintiff asked Mr. Chiu to assist her in corresponding and negotiating with one of her investment consultants, RBC Dominion Securities, the matter of compensation for losses on investments which she denied having authorized. Mr. Chiu did assist the Plaintiff in that regard in or about December 2015 and January 2016 and succeeded in obtaining for the Plaintiff compensation payments from RBC Dominion Securities in excess of CAD$25,000.</P1>
<P1>14. At all relevant times, the Plaintiff trusted and sought out the advice of Mr. Chiu with respect to potential investments. Out of love and affection for the Plaintiff, Mr. Chiu provided to the Plaintiff, to the best of his abilities, investment advice and counsel based on his understanding of the markets and his own investment experience and not on the basis of any professional qualifications or for any compensation.</P1>
<P1>15. In or about June 2015, the Plaintiff, dissatisfied with the investment results obtained for her by her account manager at CIBC Wood Gundy, chose to manage her own investments and moved most or all of her holdings from Wood Gundy into investment accounts in Hong Kong held in the name of the Plaintiff's mother, Wang Xian. The Plaintiff suffered losses in those accounts exceeding USD$1 Million within a few weeks.</P1>
<P1>16. In or about June 2015, in an effort to stop her losses, the Plaintiff requested that Mr, Chiu assist the Plaintiff in managing the Hong Kong investment accounts and Mr. Chiu helped the Plaintiff manage those accounts until April 2017. As well, from in or about August 2015, Mr, Chiu helped the Plaintiff manage a CIBC Investor's Edge account until April 2017.</P1>
<P1>17. The Plaintiff's Hong Kong investment accounts in her mother's name were self-directed investment accounts held by the firm, Essence International (also known as Anxin). Prior to Mr, Chiu being asked by the Plaintiff to help her manage those accounts, the Plaintiff had personally managed those accounts poorly and accused Essence International of misappropriating HKD$1.6 Million. Later, the Plaintiff requested that Mr. Chiu help her negotiate compensation from Essence International and Mr. Chiu did his best to assist the Plaintiff until it became clear that the Plaintiff's claims were inaccura te and that her losses had resulted from her own miscalculations.</P1>
<P1>18. On some occasions, the Plaintiff would purchase directly those investments recommended to her by Mr. Chiu. On other occasions, the Plaintiff would supply funds to Mr. Chiu on the understanding and agreement that he would purchase for the Plaintiff in either the Plaintiff's name or, as directed by the Plaintiff, in the name of the Plaintiff's mother those investments which Mr. Chiu had recommended.</P1>
<P1>19. On some occasions, funds provided to Mr. Chiu by the Plaintiff for investment purchases remained in Mr. Chiu's control after the Plaintiff changed her mind about the investments or the investments were no longer available to her. On those occasions, Mr. Chiu held the funds for the Plaintiff and, with the Plaintiff's full knowledge and agreement, Mr. Chiu used some of those funds to settle some of his own debts.</P1>
<P1>20. In allowing Mr. Chiu to use some of the funds for his own purposes under the terms of a conditional loan, the Plaintiff agreed to modify and did modify the terms of the two account management agreements dated July 4, 2015 which the Plaintiff has incorrectly described as investment agreements in paragraph 11 of the NOCC and the Plaintiff also agreed to modify and did modify the terms of the two investment agreements dated respectively May 16, 2016 and August 10, 2016 described in paragraph 11 of the NOCC. The Defendant, Mrs. Chiu, was not a party to any investment agreements with the Plaintiff dated May 16, 2016, August 10, 2016 or any other investment agreement with the Plaintiff. The Defendant, Mrs. Chiu, executed the two account management agreements dated July 4, 2015 on behalf of Mr. Chiu and not in her personal capacity and Mrs. Chiu neither h ad the skills to provide services nor did she provide services to the Plaintiff under the account management agreements.</P1>
<P1>21. The Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu were planning their future together and the Plaintiff was in complete agreement with Mr. Chiu using some of her funds for his own purposes on the basis and understanding that the Plaintiff's funds used for Mr. Chiu's own purposes were loaned by the Plaintiff to Mr. Chiu on the condition that he would repay those fun ds when he was able to do so. The Plaintiff expressed to Mr. Chiu that he was free to use the Plaintiff's funds for his own purposes and that she was grateful to Mr. Chiu for guiding her in her investments and helping her make sizeable returns on those investments.</P1>
<P1>22. In that regard, one part of the relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu was and remains one of creditor and debtor and the loan or loans made by the Plaintiff to Mr. Chiu were conditional loans. The Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu agreed again in or about October 2016 that Mr. Chiu would repay any indebtedness owed to the Plaintiff only when he was able to do so but, also, that Mr. Chiu could repay the indebtedness by continuing to help the Plaintiff trade stocks in her trading accounts without compensation but that trading profits earned in those trading accounts as a result of Mr. Chiu's advice and guidance would be treated by the Plaintiff as payment by him to reduce the said indebtedness. The Plaintiff told Mr. Chiu that she trusted him and his proven ability to generate a good return on the Plaintiff's investments on a consistent basis. The Plaintiff treated her assets as joint assets of herself and Mr. Chiu and often told Mr. Chiu that they were going to be together and share everything.</P1>
<P1>23. With the exception of the sum of USD$31,892.00 on October 16, 2015 and the sum of USD$7,000 on October 21, 2015, Mr. Chiu admits the receipt of funds from the Plaintiff as described in paragraph 8 of the NOCC but does not admit that the funds were provided to him for the purpose of purchasing for the Plaintiff the investments listed in paragraph 8 of the NOCC.</P1>
<P1>24. Mrs. Chiu denies the receipt of any funds from the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>25. In or about mid-November 2016, when the Plaintiff learned that Mr. Chiu had travelled to Hong Kong with Mrs. Chiu, the Plaintiff became very jealous and her attitude toward Mr. Chiu and the loans changed. The Plaintiff sent text and email messages to Mr. Chiu demanding that he sell for her various stocks when she knew that Mr. Chiu had not purchased those stocks for the Plaintiff and when she knew that the related funds had been loaned to Mr. Chiu by the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>26. When Mr. Chiu returned from Hong Kong in or about late November 2016, the romantic and sexual relationship between him and the Plaintiff resumed and the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu were together almost every day for lunch, dinner and other outings as a couple.</P1>
<P1>27. Mr. Chiu denies signing any promissory note in favour of the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>28. From in or about the Autumn of 2015, Mr. Chiu assisted the Plaintiff with many aspects of her personal life. For example, during late 2016 and early 2017, Mr. Chiu accompanied the Plaintiff to meet her son's school principal, accompanied the Plaintiff to a fund-raising event for her son's school, helped the Plaintiff plan her family vacation to Hawaii and provided numerous other aids to the Plaintiff as might be expected of a spouse, including helping the Plaintiff trade stock in the Hong Kong investment trading account with Essence International and in the US investment trading account with CIBC Investor's Edge without receiving any compensation from the Plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>29. During the period 2015&ndash;2017, much correspondence was conducted between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu by way of &ldquo;WeChat&rdquo;, an online messaging service which facilitates text messaging in Cantonese or Mandarin languages as well as other languages. The Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu exchanged thousands of messages via WeChat using the Plaintiff's WeChat ID, Eliza7117.</P1>
<P1>30. In early April 2017, the Plaintiff again became jealous that Mr. Chiu was spending more time with Mrs. Chiu and that they were attempting to reconcile. The Plaintiff began reminding Mr. Chiu often of his indebtedness to her and Mr. Chiu told the Plaintiff that he would make payments to her as and when he was able to do so. In keeping with tha t arrangement, Mr. Chiu made payments of USD$14,000 and USD$20,000 respectively to the Plaintiff in the month of April 2017. Mr. Chiu told the Plaintiff in mid -May 2017 that he would make a further payment of USD$70,000 in May but the Plaintiff commenced t his action and sought an order freezing Mr. Chiu's assets before he could make the proposed payment.</P1>
<P1>31. At the Plaintiff's request, Mr. Chiu conversed with the Plaintiff's tax accountant, Mr. Tony Yu, in April 2017 regarding the Plaintiff's loan to Mr. Chiu and whether or not that loan could be accounted for as a doubtful account because the Plaintiff wanted to write off the loan as a bad debt for tax purposes.</P1>
<P1>32. To date, Mr. Chiu has been able to make partial payments on his indebtedness to the Plaintiff but has not been able to pay that indebtedness in full. Mr. Chiu remains ready to enter into a payment schedule with the Plaintiff provided that he has access to his assets to make payments to the Plaintiff and provided that there be a full accounting of the indebtedness.</P1>
<P1>33. Mrs. Chiu played no part at all in the meetings, text messaging or discussions between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu concerning prospective or actual stock trading or investments by the Plaintiff. Mrs. Chiu gave no investment advice to the Plaintiff and received no compensation from the Plaintiff. Mrs. Chiu did not conspire in any way with Mr. Chiu and was not aware of any details of investments suggested to the Plaintiff by Mr. Chiu.</P1>
<P1>34. The Plaintiff's allegations as against the Defendants in fraud are entirely without merit and are based on the jealousy of a disgruntled lover and on the Plaintiff's seeking vengeance for the Defendants' marital reconciliation.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>RESPONSE TO RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>1. The Defendant Mr. Chiu consents to the granting of the relief sought in paragraphs <BOLD>NIL</BOLD> of Part 2 of the Notice of Civil Claim.</P1>
<P1>2. The Defendant Mrs. Chiu consents to the granting of the relief sought in paragraphs <BOLD>NIL</BOLD> of Part 2 of the Notice of Civil Claim.</P1>
<P1>3. The Defendants oppose the granting of the relief sought in paragraphs 28 through 36 of Part 2 of the Notice of Civil Claim.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P><P1>1. The Defendant Mrs. Chiu did not enter into a relationship in trust or contract with the Plaintiff, received no funds from the Plaintiff and had no participation in or knowledge of the dealings between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu.</P1>
<P1>2. Funds which were supplied to the Defendant Mr. Chiu by the Plaintiff and which may have been impressed with a trust in favour of the Plaintiff were released by the Plaintiff to Mr. Chiu by amending any trust relationship and specifically providing the subject funds to Mr. Chiu pursuant to a conditional loan contract.</P1>
<P1>3. The relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu was an intimate and familial one and it is in the context of the nature of that relationship that a conditional loan was made by the Plaintiff in favour of Mr. Chiu.</P1>
<P1>4. The contractual relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu is that of debtor and creditor pursuant to a conditional loan agreement</P1>
<P1>5. The Plaintiff alleges a fraud and the Defendants deny any fraud and put the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P1>

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. On May 12, 2017, the Plaintiff, Rong Wei (&ldquo;<BOLD>Wei</BOLD>&rdquo;), filed the Notice of Civil Claim seeking, among other things, a judgment against the Defendants in the approximate amount of $1.5 million pius interest, on account of funds provided to the Defendants for the purchase of shares to be held on behalf of and in trust for Wei.</P>
<P>2. The Defendant, Allan Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Chiu</BOLD>&rdquo;), is an individual who to the best of Wei's information, ordinarily resides at XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Birney Property</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Lau</BOLD>&rdquo;), is an individual who at all materials times was married to Chiu.</P>
<P>4. Wei intends to file an application in the within proceedings seeking a Mareva injunction freezing Chiu's and Lau's assets.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Defendants' Residence</EM></TI>
<P>1. Wei has known Chiu and Lau since 2014.</P>
<P>2. During that time, Wei was advised by Chiu that he and Lau lived at the Birney Property and visited them both there.</P>
<P>5. Subsequently, Chiu advised Wei that Lau was no longer living at the Birney Property and that he did not know where Lau was or how to contact her.</P>
<P>6. At this time, Wei has no information regarding the whereabouts of Lau.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Attempted Service of Chiu at the Birney Property</EM></TI>
<P>3. Prior to Wei commencing this action, Chiu had arranged to meet with Wei on May 14, 2017. Chiu had promised that at that meeting he would return to Wei some of the funds she had provided to him.</P>
<P>4. On May 12, 2017, Chiu called Wei and cancelled the May 14, 2017 meeting. Chiu told Wei that he was not able to meet with her, because he was very sick and not able to go out. Chiu also told Wei that he was ill and staying with relatives in Richmond, British Columbia, but he did not tell her where in Richmond he was staying.</P>
<P>5. Wei does not believe that Chiu was telling her the truth when he said he was staying in Richmond, because he has told her so many lies during the course of their relationship.</P>
<P>7. On the evening of May 12, 2017, Wei attended at the Birney Property in an effort to try to serve Chiu with the Notice of Civil Claim. There was no indication that anyone was home at the Birney Property and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot.</P>
<P>8. Over the course of the next two days, Wei attended at the Birney Property three times at various times of the day. On each of Wei's visits, there was no indication that anyone was home at the Birney Property and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot.</P>
<P>9. Thereafter, on the morning of May 15, 2017, Wei attended again at the Birney Property to try to serve Chiu with the Notice of Civil Claim. On that visit, Wei knocked on the front door to the Birney Property, but no one answered. There was no indication that anyone was home and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot. Wei also looked around the Defendants' neighborhood and was unable to locate their car.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Defendants' Contact Information</EM></TI>
<P>10. Throughout Wei's involvement with Chiu, Chiu and Wei communicated using email and WeChat. During that time, Chiu used the following email address: <UNDER>allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia.</UNDER> Chiu's WeChat username is: AllanC1001.</P>
<P>11. Wei and Lau also communicate by WeChat. Lau's WeChat username is: QueenieC1001. In addition, Chiu also provided Wei with the following email address by Lau, as well as himself: XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>12. Previously, Lau also provided Wei with her cellphone number. Wei has tried calling Lau's cellphone number to arrange a meeting to serve her with the Notice of Civil Claim, but Lau did not pick up Wei's call and the call did not go to voicemail.</P>
<P>13. If a copy of the Notice of Civil Claim is emailed to Chiu and Lau and a WeChat message is sent to them advising that the Notice of Civil Claim has been emailed, it is likely that they will receive the Notice of Civil Claim.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>1. Under Rule 4-3(1) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, unless the Court otherwise orders, a Notice of Civil must be served by personal service.</P>
<P>2. Pursuant to Rule 4-4(1) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, the Court may, on application without notice, make an order for substituted service granting permission to use an alternative method of service.</P>
<P>3. The Court may grant an order for substituted service if it is impracticable to serve a document by personal service or if the person to be served by personal service
<P1>(a) cannot be found after a diligent search, or</P1>
<P1>(b) is evading service of the documents.</P1></P>
<P>4. The Plaintiff has made diligent efforts to serve Mr. Chiu. Mr. Chiu either cannot be found, or is likely already aware of this claim and evading service.</P>
<P>5. To the best of the Plaintiff's information Lau no longer lives at the Birney Property and the Plaintiff has no other information regarding Lau's whereabouts. Due to the urgency and nature of this matter, it would be impractical for the Plaintiff to be required to serve Lau personally.</P>
<P>6. In the event the Court grants the order sought, there is no reason to believe that the Notice of Civil Claim will not come to the attention of the Defendants.</P>
<P>7. In the circumstances, it would be just for the Court to exercise its discretion to grant the order sought.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT</UNDER></TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>RONG (ELIZA) WEI</BOLD>, of Vancouver, British Columbia, housewife, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the plaintiff in this action and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter referred to save and except where stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated, I verily believe same to be true.</P>
<P>2. I moved to Vancouver from China seven years ago. I am currently a housewife. I have a Master's degree in finance from the Dongbei University of Finance and Economics in China. Previously, I worked for the credit card department of the China Construction Bank in China.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Introduction</EM></TI>
<P>3. I first met Allan Chiu and his wife Queenie Lau in 2014 at the River Club in Richmond, B.C. where our respective children were taking tennis lessons. Over the course of watching our children's lessons, we got to know each other socially.</P>
<P>4. In the course of our discussions, I told Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau that I had some money that I wanted to invest in Hong Kong equities and that I was looking for investment advice.</P>
<P>5. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau told me that Mr. Chiu was an experienced investor and could assist me with investments in Hong Kong and elsewhere. They told me, in particular, that Mr. Chiu:
<P1>a. had a Bachelor of Commerce from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia and a Masters of Business Administration from Brown University;</P1>
<P1>b. had considerable experience in investing as a result of high level positions with Goldman Sachs' offices in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore, including most recently before he retired working as the Department Head of the Asia Pacific (Including Japan) Institutional Buying Side of Goldman Sachs' Hong Kong office;</P1>
<P1>c. when he had worked at Goldman Sachs, he had been responsible for managing a portfolio of USD$20 billion for institutional clients;</P1>
<P1>d. had worked as a consultant for companies after his retirement from Goldman Sachs, like a Singapore state-owned holding company named Temasek, where he had made approximately USD$2 million per year, Progress Energy and other large companies in Dubai; and</P1>
<P1>e. had worked for Petronas Petroliam Nasional Berhad.</P1></P>
<P>6. At first Mr. Chiu identified a couple of stocks, which I observed. These stocks performed relatively well, which further led me to believe Mr. Chiu had significant investment experience.</P>
<P>7. In or about August 2015 I gave Mr. Chiu the password to one of my small investment accounts, so he could manage that account on my behalf (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Wei CIBC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>8. I later gave him the password to a larger investment account registered in my mother's name, so he could manage that account also.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Goldman Sachs Account</EM></TI>
<P>9. In the spring of 2015 Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau recommended that I invest in the U.S. stock market. In particular, they recommended that I purchase U.S. IPOs.</P>
<P>10. To do so, they told me I needed to transfer money to Mr. Chiu so that he could make investments on my behalf using his &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; trust account with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong (the &ldquo;GS Account&rdquo;). Mr. Chiu told me that he had received the GS Account, because of his former employment with Goldman Sachs. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau told me that, through the GS Account, Mr. Chiu could purchase good IPOs that were not accessible to the public and that, as a result, I would make a better return on my investments, which they estimated at over 20% per year.</P>
<P>11. Mr. Chiu also told me that he had USD$26.3 million of his own money in the GS Account.</P>
<P>12. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau told me that I would only be able to benefit from this preferential access if the investments were purchased for me by Mr. Chiu through the GS Account and in Mr. Chiu's name. To facilitate this, they told me that I would need to transfer funds into Mr. Chiu's name through Ms. Lau's bank account with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, account number XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;). While at times I provided Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau with cash, the majority of the funds I provided to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau between 2015 and 2016 were transferred from my account to the CIBC Account.</P>
<P>13. I understood that Mr. Chiu would hold any shares he purchased for me on my behalf and in trust for me.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Investment in TRU</EM></TI>
<P>14. In June 2015 Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest in an IPO being issued by TransUnion (stock symbol TRU). He described this as a very good investment that would likely yield a return of 20% in 6 months.</P>
<P>15. To enable him to purchase the TRU shares on my behalf, Mr. Chiu instructed me to provide Ms. Lau USD$200,000, which she would in turn provide to him to deposit in the GS Account.</P>
<P>16. I agreed to do so and, on June 23, 2015, provided USD$162,000 to Ms. Lau and subsequently, on June 26, 2015, provided the remaining balance of USD$38,000 to Ms. Lau. These funds were provided to Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in TRU on my behalf.</P>
<P>17. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the bank drafts evidencing these payments to Ms. Lau. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of one of the bank drafts that was signed by Ms. Lau when I provided it to her.</P>
<P>18. Mr. Chiu told me that he purchased on my behalf 8888 shares of the TRU IPO at a share price of USD$22.50/per share.</P>
<P>19. About the time I made these payments, I asked Mr. Chiu if he could execute a share pledge to show that he held the TRU shares on my behalf. Mr. Chiu told me that it was most important that I trust him and that he was not prepared to invest on my behalf if I did not do so.</P>
<P>20. I also asked Mr. Chiu to provide me with evidence, like a screen shot, that he had purchased the TRU shares, but he told me that because my purchase was part of a much larger institutional transaction made through Goldman Sachs he was unable to provide evidence of the transaction he had made for me.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The 2015 Investment Agreements</EM></TI>
<P>21. About this time I suggested to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau that we enter into some form of agreement to evidence that they were managing, and holding on my behalf, my investments.</P>
<P>22. Because he was still managing my mother's Hong Kong account, Mr. Chiu suggested we enter into two agreements, which he prepared:
<P1>a. an agreement in respect of my mother's Hong Kong account, a copy of which is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>; and</P1>
<P1>b. a second agreement in respect of U.S. shares he would purchase through the GS Account, as well as the shares I held in the Wei CIBC Account (the &ldquo;US Agreement of Undertaking&rdquo;), a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>23. Mr. Chiu told me that, because he was not certified in Canada, he could not sign these investment agreements and it is for this reason that Ms. Lau signed them instead.</P>
<P>24. At the time I signed the US Agreement of Undertaking, I provided Ms. Lau with USD$3,967 in cash, representing the US equivalent of the CAD$5,000 management fee under that agreement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Investment in RACE</EM></TI>
<P>25. In October 2015 Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest in an IPO being issued by Ferrari NV (stock symbol RACE). He again described this as a very good investment opportunity.</P>
<P>26. Mr. Chiu advised me that he would sell approximately 3,494 of the TRU shares he had purchased on my behalf and use the proceeds, approximately USD$89,383, from that sale to buy RACE shares for me.</P>
<P>27. To enable him to purchase further RACE shares on my behalf, Mr. Chiu instructed me to provide to Ms. Lau an additional USD$86,892, which she would in turn provide to him.</P>
<P>28. I agreed to do so and, on October 15, 2015, provided USD$55,000 to Ms. Lau and subsequently, on October 16, 2015, provided the remaining balance of USD$31,892 to Ms. Lau. These funds were provided to Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in RACE on my behalf.</P>
<P>29. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> and <BOLD>&ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the transaction records evidencing these payments to the CIBC Account.</P>
<P>30. On October 17, 2015, Mr. Chiu provided me with a summary of the investments he had made on my behalf. A copy of this report is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD>, along with print outs showing the value in my investment accounts as of August 25, 2015 and October 17, 2015.</P>
<P>31. On October 17, 2015, Mr. Chiu also provided me with a summary of the commissions and management fees he had incurred to date. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of this summary.</P>
<P>32. After providing this summary, Mr, Chiu advised me that the price for the RACE shares was higher than he had expected and that he required an additional USD$7,000.00 to complete the purchase. Mr. Chiu told me that this additional amount was required because the share price for the RACE shares had increased from USD$50 per share to USD$52 per share.</P>
<P>33. On October 21, 2015 I provided this amount to Ms. Lau. This amount was provided to Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu again for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in RACE on my behalf.</P>
<P>34. On December 8, 2015 I paid to Ms. Lau the management fees indicated on Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</P>
<P>35. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of my bank records evidencing these payments, as well as an additional payment for their management fee.</P>
<P>36. On December 6, 2015, Mr. Chiu provided me with a summary of the investments he had made on my behalf. A copy of this report is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD>, along With print outs showing the value in my investment accounts as of December 6, 2015.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Investment in Airbnb</EM></TI>
<P>37. In January 2016 Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest USD$960,000 in an IPO being issued by Airbnb. He again indicated to me that this would be a good investment that would yield significant returns. He further indicated to me that he expected that the investment would double in a year.</P>
<P>38. I was not prepared, nor was I able, to invest USD$960,000 in the Airbnb IPO, but I agreed to provide Mr. Chiu with USD$64,000 to enable him to purchase Airbnb shares on my behalf. Mr. Chiu instructed me to provide to Ms. Lau USD$64,000, which she would in turn provide to him.</P>
<P>39. I agreed to do so and, on January 5, 2016, provided USD$69,899.91 to Ms. Lau. This payment represented the USD$64,000 investment amount and an amount owing for management fees. The USD$64,000 was provided to Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in Airbnb on my behalf.</P>
<P>40. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of my bank records evidencing these payments, as well as an additional payment for their management fee.</P>
<P>41. Although I had advised Mr. Chiu that I did not have USD$960,000 to invest in Airbnb, he suggested that I pay what I could at that time and he would cover the rest of the investment until I had more cash. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> is an email dated January 20, 2016 to this effect, enclosing an agreement he prepared.</P>
<P>42. The email address Mr. Chiu uses to communicate with me is: <UNDER>allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia</UNDER> This led me to believe that Mr. Chiu had set up a consulting company.</P>
<P>43. After I had provided Mr. Chiu with the USD$64,000 to purchase shares in Airbnb on my behalf, Mr. Chiu advised me that Airbnb had not gone through with the IPO and so he had not purchased any shares in Airbnb.</P>
<P>44. Mr. Chiu did not return to me the USD$64,000 I had provided in January 2016. This caused me some concern and I asked Mr. Chiu over WeChat to provide me with proof that he was holding the investments he had made to date for me, and also provide proof of the assets he said he owned. In response to my message, we exchanged emails, copies of which are attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>45. I subsequently met with Mr. Chiu and he assured me he was acting in my best interests, cared about my well-being and was holding my investment in trust for me. Given these reassurances, I did not persist in asking him for additional information concerning the investments he was holding on my behalf.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Involvement of Ms. Lau</EM></TI>
<P>46. The investments described to above were discussed in the presence of Ms. Lau. In these conversations Ms. Lau often reinforced and agreed with what Mr. Chiu suggested I do.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Investment in UK</EM></TI>
<P>47. In May 2016 Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>48. Mr. Chiu advised me that the UK market was undervalued as a result of the uncertainty posed by the UK's upcoming referendum on the European Union. He told me that he had learned that Goldman Sachs advisors were predicting a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on the referendum and when that occurred, the UK stock market would rise approximately 20%.</P>
<P>49. I was reluctant to invest any more money but Mr. Chiu persisted and repeated to me that this was a very good investment.</P>
<P>50. Mr. Chiu told me that he would use the USD$64,000, which I had provided him in January 2016 for investing in Airbnb, to buy shares in the UK market for me.</P>
<P>51. Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest a further USD$500,000, but I indicated that I was unable to invest this amount of money. Mr. Chiu then told me that if I could invest USD$300,000 he would invest the balance using his own funds.</P>
<P>52. On May 16, 2016, Mr. Chiu presented me with another investment agreement concerning the UK investments. Around this time, Mr. Chiu had separated from Ms. Lau. Mr. Chiu therefore signed the agreement himself. He told me that, because we knew each other better, it was now okay for him to sign investment agreements himself. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of this agreement.</P>
<P>53. I agreed to invest a further USD$300,000 and, on May 17, 2016, provided USD$300,000 to Mr. Chiu through the CIBC Account, which was the same account that I had used to provide funds to Ms. Lau in the past. These funds were provided to Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in the UK market on my behalf.</P>
<P>54. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of my bank records evidencing this payment.</P>
<P>55. In August 2016 I sold a property in Las Vegas for net proceeds of USD$248,891.20. When Mr. Chiu learned of this he pressured me to invest an additional USD$200,000, to cover the investment he had made with me in May 2016.</P>
<P>56. On August 10, 2016, Mr. Chiu presented me with another investment agreement concerning this further UK investment. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of this agreement.</P>
<P>57. I agreed to invest a further USD$200,000 in the UK market and, on August 5, 2016, provided USD$200,000 to Mr. Chiu through the CIBC Account. These funds were provided to Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in the UK market on my behalf.</P>
<P>58. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of my bank records evidencing this payment.</P>
<P>59. On August 10, 2016, Mr. Chiu provided me with another summary of the investments he had made on my behalf. A copy of this report is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>60. In October 2016 Mr. Chiu recommended that I invest in an IPO being issued by a bank with a stock symbol of NTB. Mr. Chiu told me that he had learned that Goldman Sachs would be acquiring this bank, causing its share price to increase significantly.</P>
<P>61. Initially, I told Mr. Chiu that I did not want to purchase any stock in NTB at that time, but Mr. Chiu continued to recommend to me that I invest in NTB. Mr. Chiu advised me that he had bought some shares in NTB and that they had already increased in value. He offered to sell me some of those shares at the price he had purchased them at, because of our good relationship and because he needed some money for his daughter's schooling.</P>
<P>62. I agreed to invest a further USD$240,875 and, on October 12, 2016, provided USD$240,875 to Mr. Chiu through the same account that I had paid Ms. Lau in the past. These funds were provided to Mr. Chiu for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in a bank with a stock symbol of NTB on my behalf, and in selling to me shares he had already purchased in NTB.</P>
<P>63. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of my bank records evidencing this payment.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Summary of my Involvement with Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau</EM></TI>
<P>64. Between June 2015 and October 2016, I provided over USD$1,100,000 to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau for the sole and specific purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing investments on my behalf. I relied upon the representations made to me by Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau, as set out in paragraph 4 above, in deciding to provide this money to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>65. At all times, it was my understanding and intention that any shares purchased using the funds I provided to Ms. Lau and through her Mr. Chiu would be held on my behalf and in trust for me.</P>
<P>66. Mr. Chiu also told me a number of times that he held properties around the world, including a house and apartment in Singapore and a property in San Francisco. He also told me that Ms. Lau owned a townhouse in London's W8 district. I further relied upon Mr. Chiu's representations to me that he owned a lot of valuable property in deciding to provide my money to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>67. Between June 2015 and October 2016, I also provided Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau with payments for commissions and management fees that they told me were owed as a result of them managing my investments. During this time, I gave Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau approximately USD$44,000 on account of commissions and management fees.</P>
<P>68. In 2016 I became more friendly with Mr. Chiu and he asked me to accompany him on trips to Europe and Singapore. Mr. Chiu would spend lavishly on these trips. He would pay for us to fly business class, dine in Michelin star restaurants and stay in luxury hotels, like the Four Seasons.</P>
<P>69. After Ms. Lau left Mr. Chiu I sensed that Mr. Chiu was interested in me in a romantic sense. He told me on more than one occasion that he was attracted to me and wanted us to be together. We were at times involved in a romantic way.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Return of Funds</EM></TI>
<P>70. Under the UK investment agreements, Mr. Chiu was to return my investments, plus any net return, on or before October 31, 2016.</P>
<P>71. In November I asked Mr. Chiu to return my investments in TRU, RACE, NTB and the UK market. On November 17, 2016, I sent an email to Mr. Chiu asking him to sell my investments in TRU, RACE, NTB and the UK market, and transfer the funds into my mother's US account. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo;</BOLD> is my email to Mr. Chiu, dated November 17, 2016 requesting that he sell my investments.</P>
<P>72. At that time he told me that he had been required to loan Ms. Lau money for her fashion business and also to pay tuition and other amounts for his daughter's private school in the United Kingdom. To make these payments he had sold off millions of dollars of the investments in the GS account. He told me that if he sold any more investments in the current tax year he would pay a significant penalty. He told me that, to avoid paying this penalty, he would need to wait until April 1, 2017, the start of the next tax year, to sell my investments and repay my money.</P>
<P>73. I became concerned and asked Mr. Chiu to execute a promissory note which I prepared, in part to confirm the total amount of my investments. When we discussed this promissory note, Mr. Chiu agreed to offer, as security for the amount owed, property he held at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Ocean Drive Property</BOLD>&rdquo;). A copy of this document is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;V&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>74. On March 28, 2017, I met again with Mr. Chiu. At that time Mr. Chiu told me that he could not return my money because he and Ms. Lau were undergoing a divorce. He asked me to sign a loan agreement he wrote up agreeing to extend any repayment to me until his divorce was finalized. I refused to the sign the loan agreement. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;W&rdquo;</BOLD> are one of the drafts of the loan agreement Mr. Chiu provided to me.</P>
<P>75. During the March 28, 2017 meeting, I recorded my conversations with Mr. Chiu using my iPhone. I believe that Mr. Chiu became suspicious that I was recording the meeting, because he asked if I was recording us. I did not answer Mr. Chiu's question.</P>
<P>76. A couple of days later, Mr. Chiu and I arranged to meet again. Mr. Chiu told me that, at the meeting, he would repay me some of my money. He also asked me to bring originals of the investment agreements we had signed and the transfers I had made to Ms. Lau's account.</P>
<P>77. On or about April 6, 2017, I met with Mr. Chiu and he returned to me USD$14,000 of the money I had provided to him. I believe at this meeting that Mr. Chiu stole my iPhone, as it was not among my belongings after we parted company. I believe Mr. Chiu stole my iPhone while I was counting the money he gave me. Mr. Chiu and I corresponded to a large extent using an instant messaging program called WeChat. I believe Mr. Chiu stole my phone so that he could delete those messages and the recordings I had made of our previous conversations.</P>
<P>78. A couple of days later, on or about April 9, 2017, Mr. Chiu gave me USD$20,000 and again asked me to sign the loan agreement I had refused to sign. I again refused to sign the loan agreement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Dissipation of Assets</EM></TI>
<P>79. I am concerned that Mr. Chiu will take steps to hide and or dissipate his assets.</P>
<P>80. At one point Mr. Chiu recommended that I open an account in the British Virgin Islands to hold all of my investments. I believe he may also have accounts there, or in other offshore locations.</P>
<P>81. Recently, Mr. Chiu advised me that he will be traveling to Hong Kong to sign his divorce agreement with Ms. Lau and that he has also booked a surgery in Hong Kong on May 19, 2017. Mr. Chiu told me that he will meet with me on May 14, 2017 to return USD$70,000 of the funds I have provided to him and that he will then travel to Hong Kong for May 19.</P>
<P>82. On May 11, 2017, I sent a WeChat to Mr. Chiu asking if he could give me the USD$70,000 on May 13, 2017 instead of May 14. I did not receive a response to my message.</P>
<P>83. On May 12, 2017, at approximately 6:40 am, I went to Mr. Chiu's townhouse at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX There were no on house and I could not find his car in the townhouse's garage.</P>
<P>84. Later on May 12, 2017, I received a call from Mr. Chiu. Mr. Chiu told me that he was ill and staying with relatives in Richmond, British Columbia, but he did not tell me where in Richmond he was staying. Mr. Chiu also told me that he would not be able to meet with me this weekend, because he was very sick and not able to go out. Mr. Chiu said that he might wire transfer me the USD$70,000 on Monday, May 15, 2017.</P>
<P>85. During our telephone conversation on May 12, 2017, Mr. Chiu also stated that because he is very sick, he can no longer go to Hong Kong. He said that he will now have the surgery in Vancouver in a few weeks' time.</P>
<P>86. I believe that Mr. Chiu was not being truthful with me during our May 12 call and that he has gone into hiding. I am concerned that if Mr. Chiu has not already left British Columbia, he may leave soon. I am also concerned that if Mr. Chiu leaves British Columbia, he will not return and that he will take assets with him from British Columbia.</P>
<P>87. In November 2016, Mr. Chiu told me he had worked for Stoneset Equities and gave me his business card. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;X&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd. business card for Allan Chiu. At that time, Mr. Chiu also showed me his residency card for Singapore.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Investigation into Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau</EM></TI>
<P>88. In or about the fall of 2016, I retained John Hilpert, a private investigator in Vancouver, to look into Mr. Chiu to try to verify Mr. Chiu's identity and some of the claims he had made to me about his past.</P>
<P>89. During that time period, I also retained I-OnAsia Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>OnAsia</BOLD>&rdquo;) to undertake a background search of Mr. Chiu in Hong Kong. I provided OnAsia with various information that Mr. Chiu had told me about his education and work experience and requested that OnAsia take steps to try to verify that information.</P>
<P>90. OnAsia advised me that based upon its inquiries it had determined that:
<P1>a. Mr. Chiu did not attend the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business during the period he advised me he had attend that school;</P1>
<P1>b. Mr. Chiu did not attend Brown University;</P1>
<P1>c. Mr. Chiu is not a member of the CFA Institute, although the CFA Institute does have a record of an Alan Chiu of Pokfulam, Hong Kong;</P1>
<P1>d. Mr. Chiu was not employed with Petronas Petroliam Nasional Berhad;</P1>
<P1>e. Mr. Chiu was not employed with Temasek Holdings Private Limited; and</P1>
<P1>f. Mr. Chiu was not employed at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC or Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.</P1></P>
<P>91. OnAsia also advised me that it conducted searches of property transactions in Hong Kong using Mr. Chiu's name in English and Chinese, but that it was unable to locate any property transactions in Hong Kong involving Mr. Chiu.</P>
<P>92. During that time period, I also retained David Kang, a private investigator in Singapore, to undertake searches into Mr. Chiu in Singapore.</P>
<P>93. Mr. Kang advised me that based upon his inquiries he had determined that:
<P1>a. the Ocean Drive Property is owed by a company called Interlocal Exim Pte. Ltd.;</P1>
<P1>b. Mr. Chiu does not appear to own property in Singapore;</P1>
<P1>c. the Singapore Registrar of Companies and Business Names listed a &ldquo;Chiu Sung Fai&rdquo; as a director of Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd.;</P1>
<P1>d. Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd. listed a business address in Hong Kong;</P1>
<P1>e. Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd. was stuck off the Singapore Registrar of Companies and Business Names in 2010; and</P1>
<P1>f. Mr. Chiu was sued for bankruptcy in 2001.</P1></P>
<P>94. After I received the above information from Mr. Kang, I asked Mr, Chiu about the Ocean Drive Property and he told me that for tax purposes he had used a number of companies to put a lot of layers between himself and properties he owned. Mr. Chiu told me that some of the companies he used were companies in the British Virgin Islands.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Undertaking as to Damages</EM></TI>
<P>95. I have made an undertaking as to damages, which is attached to this affidavit as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Y&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT</UNDER></TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>JOHN HILPERT</BOLD>, of Vancouver, British Columbia, private investigator, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a private investigator retained by the plaintiff, Rong Wei, and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter referred to save and except where stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated, I veriiy believe same to be true.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Introduction</EM></TI>
<P>2. On or about November 16, 2016, I was hired by Ms. Wei to look into Allan Chiu to verify his identity and certain claims he had made to Ms. Wei regarding his past.</P>
<P>3. Ms. Wei provided me with the name Allan Chiu and that she believed him to be 58 years of age. Additionally, Ms. Wei provided information on Mr. Chiu's spouse, Mui Kwan Queenie LAU, by providing a copy of her BC driver's license, which provided her date of birth as XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>4. I used the above information to verify that Mr. Chiu's full name is Allan SungFai Chiu and that his date of birth is XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>5. I used these particulars in the course of my investigation to confirm whether records referencing the name &ldquo;Allan Chiu&rdquo; were referring to the individual that was the subject of my investigation.</P>
<P>6. Through my investigations, I also confirmed that Mr. Chiu currently resides at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Mr. Chiu's Education Background</EM></TI>
<P>7. I understood from Ms. Wei that Mr. Chiu advised her that he had a Bachelor of Commerce from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia and a Masters of Business Administration from Brown University. As a result, I contacted the Sauder School of Business and Brown University in an effort to try to verify this information.</P>
<P>8. On November 28, 2016, I was advised by a representative of the Sauder School of Business that while it had a record of an Allan Chiu attending the school from 1974 to 1979, its records did not match Mr. Chiu's full name or date of birth.</P>
<P>9. On November 25, 2016, I was advised by the Admissions and Alumni Office of Brown University that it had searched its records from 1975 to 1985 and that it was unable to confirm that an Allan S. Chiu born in XXXXXXXXXX had attended the school as an under graduate or graduate student.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Goldman Sachs</EM></TI>
<P>10. I further understood from Ms. Wei that Mr. Chiu had advised her that he had previously worked in a high level management role for Goldman Sachs in its Asia divisions. Specifically, I understood that Mr. Chiu had said he worked for Goldman Sachs in Singapore between 1985&ndash;1997 and Hong Kong from 1998&ndash;2008.</P>
<P>11. On or about November 29, 2016 I contacted several Asian division branches of Goldman Sachs and made inquiries about Mr. Chiu. Additionally, i researched and inquired with current Investment Analysts with publicly listed previous work histories to Goldman Sachs and their Asian divisions.</P>
<P>12. I was unable to confirm with Goldman Sachs or anyone previously working for their Asian divisions that anyone named Allan Chiu had worked for or been associated to Goldman Sachs or any of its equity investment divisions.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Stoneset Equity</EM></TI>
<P>13. Ms. Wei had also advised me that she had been informed by Mr. Chiu that he had previously lived in Calgary, Alberta and been employed with Temasek Private Holdings Ltd.</P>
<P>14. During the course of my investigation, I could not find any association or employment between Temasek Private Holdings Ltd. and Mr. Chiu.</P>
<P>15. During the course of my investigation, I found that Mr. Chiu's last employment was with Stoneset Asia Equities (&ldquo;<BOLD>Stoneset Equities</BOLD>&rdquo;). It is my understanding that Stoneset Asia Equities is part of the Stoneset group of companies (collectively, &ldquo;<BOLD>Stoneset</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>16. During the course of my Investigation, I additionally confirmed that Ms. Lau was also last employed with Stoneset Equities as a translator.</P>
<P>17. As part of my investigations, I made inquiries about Mr. Chiu with a confidential informant within the private equity trade whose initials are P.S. As a private investigator, it is my practice not to name confidential informants without their permission to do so, as I need to maintain good relationships with my confidential informants so that they will provide me with information in the future. In this case, P.S. has not given me permission to name him.</P>
<P>18. I asked P.S., who has access to personal information, to assist in identifying Mr. Chiu and his employment with Stoneset Equities. I consider P.S. to be a reliable source, because I have worked with P.S. in the past and have found the information he has provided me in the past to be reliable. I am also aware that P.S. has experience working with oil and gas projects in Alberta and that he would be knowledgeable about the investment community in Alberta.</P>
<P>19. I provided P.S. with Mr. Chiu's personal details and a recent photograph. P.S. advised me that he had known an individual by the name of Allan Chiu from Calgary who matched the photograph I provided.</P>
<P>20. P.S. advised me that the individual he knew had been involved in a major equities scandal in Calgary around 2011 and further advised me that the scandal had involved a real estate investment scheme, which proved to be a Ponzi scheme.</P>
<P>21. P.S. also stated that he was not aware of any disciplinary action that had been taken against Mr. Chiu. P.S. stated he believed that Mr. Chiu had lost money himself and for his investors in the scheme, and that Mr. Chiu had since retired to stay away from the backlash of potential prosecution.</P>
<P>22. I was also able to locate an online news article from the Montreal Gazette, which discussed some of the allegations against one of the Stoneset companies. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;<BOLD>A</BOLD>&rdquo; to this affidavit is a copy of an online news article from the Montreal Gazette, which discusses Stoneset.</P>
<P>23. I also conducted a search of Alberta Investors Protection's website and found an article entitled &ldquo;Calgary Investigation reveals Alberta Investors protection;&rdquo; which referred to Stoneset Equities. I cannot recall if the article was posted directly on Alberta Investors Protection's website or whether the website had a link to the article, but I printed out a copy of the article. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;<BOLD>B</BOLD>&rdquo; to this affidavit is a copy of the article I printed out entitled &ldquo;Calgary Investigation reveals Alberta Investors protection;&rdquo;</P>
<P>24. Stoneset Equities is also listed on Alberta Investors Protection's website under the heading &ldquo;Alberta EMD Failed/Failing Investments&rdquo;. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; to this affidavit is a copy of a print out from Alberta Investors Protection's website.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Allan Chiu Consulting</EM></TI>
<P>25. During the course of my investigations, I determined that Mr. Chiu had been holding himself out as operating a business under the name Allan Chiu Consulting.</P>
<P>26. I located a URL for a website for Allan Chiu Consulting, which was <UNDER>www.allanchiuconsulting.asia</UNDER>. I was able to determine that this URL address had an active website from 2009 to March 2016. The URL address remained active and owned by Mr. Chiu until March 2017.</P>
<P>27. Mr. Chiu had listed the business address for Allan Chiu Consulting as a PO Box located in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>28. An additional address and phone number listed in Calgary, Alberta confirmed the URL to belong to Allan Chiu, the subject of my investigation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Royal Bank Debt</EM></TI>
<P>29. As part of my investigation, I conducted a limited credit and asset inquiry for Mr. Chiu and Mui Lau.</P>
<P>30. The results of this inquiry disclosed that Mr. Chiu had an outstanding debt of $34,000 owed to the Royal Bank. The results of the debt inquiry indicated that the Royal Bank attempted collection actions against Mr. Chiu for the debt and had since written off the debt as a bad debt in 2014.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Mui Kwan Queenie Lau</EM></TI>
<P>31. As a part of my investigation, I also arranged for property searches to be conducted in the United Kingdom for the name Mui Kwan Queenie Lau.</P>
<P>32. The results of these searches came back negative. The search results did provide a number of variances on the name Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, but none of these variances appeared to match Ms. Lau.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT</UNDER></TI>
<P>I, <BOLD>RONG (ELIZA) WEI</BOLD>, of Vancouver, British Columbia, housewife, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the plaintiff in this action and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter referred to save and except where stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated, I verily believe same to be true.</P>
<P>2. On May 12, 2017, my counsel filed a Notice of Civil Claim in this matter.</P>
<P>3. I swear this affidavit in support of my application for an order permitting me to serve the Notice of Civil Claim and my application for a Mareva injunction on the Defendants, Allan Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Chiu</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Lau</BOLD>&rdquo;) by alternative means.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Defendants' Residence</EM></TI>
<P>4. I have known Chiu and Lau since 2014.</P>
<P>5. During that time, Chiu told me that he and Lau lived at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Birney Property</BOLD>&rdquo;). Initially, Chiu told me that he and Lau owned the Birney Property, but I now understand that they rented the property.</P>
<P>6. In or about February 2017, I visited both Chiu and Lau at the Birney Property.</P>
<P>7. Subsequently, I understood from Chiu that Lau was no longer living at the Birney Property. Chiu also told me that he does not know where Lau is.</P>
<P>8. At this time, I have no information regarding the whereabouts of Lau.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Attempts to Serve Defendants</EM></TI>
<P>9. As stated in my first affidavit, made May 12, 2017, I had previously made plans to meet Chiu on May 14, 2017 at which time he had promised to return to me USD$70,000 of the money I had provided to Chiu and Lau, but on May 12, Chiu called me to cancel that meeting.</P>
<P>10. I have not received any communications from Chiu since May 12, 2017. Chiu also did not transfer any funds to me on May 15, 2017.</P>
<P>11. Also as stated in my first affidavit, during my conversation with Chiu on May 12, 2017, Chiu told me that he was staying with relatives in Richmond. I do not believe that Chiu was telling me the truth when he said he was staying in Richmond, because he has told me so many lies during our relationship.</P>
<P>12. On May 12, 2017, I went to the Birney Property at approximately 10:45 pm in an effort to try to serve Chiu with the Notice of Civil Claim. There was no indication that anyone was home at the Birney Property and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot.</P>
<P>13. The next day, May 13, 2017, I want to the Birney Property twice at approximately 8:00 am and 11:10 pm. At those times, there was no indication that anyone was home at the Birney Property and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot.</P>
<P>14. Subsequently, on May 14, 2017, at approximately 12:20 pm, I went to the Birney Property to try to serve Chiu with the Notice of Civil Claim. Once again, there was no indication that anyone was at home and the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot.</P>
<P>15. The following day, May 15, 2017, at approximately, 8:25 am, I went again to the Birney Property to try to serve Chiu with the Notice of Civil Claim. On that visit, I knocked on the front door to the Birney Property, but no one answered. There was no indication that anyone was home and I again observed that the Defendants' car was not in their parking spot. I also looked around the Defendants' neighborhood to try to locate their car, but I could not find it.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Defendants' Contact Information</EM></TI>
<P>16. As set out in my first affidavit, made May 12, 2017, during my involvement with Chiu, he used the following email address to communicate with me: <UNDER>allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia</UNDER></P>
<P>17. Chiu and I also frequently communicate by WeChat. Chiu's WeChat username is: AllanC1001. Chiu also provided me with his cellphone number, which XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>18. I believe that if a copy of the Notice of Civil Claim was emailed to Chiu at the above email address, he would receive the Notice of Civil Claim. This is particularly the case if a WeChat message was sent to Chiu advising him that the Notice of Civil Claim had been sent to his email account.</P>
<P>19. At one point, Chiu also provided me with the following email address to communicate with him and advised me that this email address was a shared email address used by Lau, as as himself: XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>20. In addition, Lau and I communicate by WeChat. Lau's WeChat username is: QueenieC1001.</P>
<P>21. Lau also provided me with her cellphone number, which is XXXXXXXXXX. I have tried calling Lau's cellphone number to arrange a meeting to serve her with the Notice of Civil Claim, but she did not pick up my call and the call did not go to voicemail.</P>
<P>22. I believe that if a copy of the Notice of Civil Claim was emailed to Lau at the above email address and a WeChat message was set to Lau advising her that the Notice of Civil Claim had been emailed, she would receive the Notice of Civil Claim.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Chiu's use of Cash</EM></TI>
<P>23. When I travelled with Chiu to different places, he would bring large amounts of cash with him and used cash to pay for things.</P>
<P>24. Chiu told me that for tax reasons he did not always deposit his money into a bank account. At one time, Chiu recommended to me that I not keep my money in a bank account and instead keep it in a safe or safety deposit box.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>TD Bank Account</EM></TI>
<P>25. In or around February 2017, I met with Chiu and he showed me what he said was a summary of my investments.</P>
<P>26. On the back of the summary was banking information for Chiu or Lau from TD Bank. I wanted to keep the summary of my investments, but Chiu told me I could not keep the summary and took the paper from me. He said this was because the paper had personal information on the back.</P>
<P>27. Because of the TD Bank banking information I saw, I believe that Chiu, Lau or both of them have a bank account with TD Bank.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Scotiabank Account</EM></TI>
<P>28. Earlier this year, I went to see a movie with Chiu at Cineplex. At that time, Chiu used a SCENE card.</P>
<P>29. It is my understanding that the SCENE card is a rewards program linked to Scotiabank.</P>
<P>30. For this reason, I believe that Chiu may also have a bank account with Scotiabank.</P>

<P><BOLD>Name of applicant: Rong Wei</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>On notice to: Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwun Queenie Chiu</BOLD></P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge or master at the courthouse at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia on 18/May/2017 at 9:45 am for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. A Mareva injunction, substantially in the form attached hereto as <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>; and</P>
<P>2. An Norwich Pharmacal Order, substantially in the form attached hereto as <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. Between 2015 and 2016, the plaintiff, Rong Wei (&ldquo;<BOLD>Wei</BOLD>&rdquo;), provided over USD$1.1 million to the defendants, Allan Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Chiu</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau (&ldquo;<BOLD>Lau</BOLD>&rdquo;) to make certain investments on her behalf.</P>
<P>4. Chiu and Lau induced Wei to provide these funds based on representations that, among other things, such funds would be used by Chiu to purchase shares for Wei, Chiu had considerable experience in investing as a result of high level positions with Goldman Sachs, and that Chiu owned properties around the world.</P>
<P>5. At all material times, it was Wei's understanding that any shares purchased using the funds she provided to Chiu and Lau would be held on her behalf and in trust for her.</P>
<P>6. Wei has recently learned, through investigative efforts, that the representations made to her by Chiu and Lau were false. Despite repeated demands, with the exception of USD$34,000, Chiu and Lau have failed to return to Wei the funds she provided to them.</P>
<P>7. Wei's recent inquiries of Chui have been ignored. Wei believes Chui has gone into hiding and may soon leave British Columbia, if he has not already.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Wei's Investment with Chiu and Lau</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. Chin and Lau are husband and wife.</P>
<P>9. In 2014, Wei met Chiu and Lau. Through the course of various discussions, Wei told Chiu and Lau that she had some money that she wanted to invest and was looking for investment advice.</P>
<P>10. Wei was advised by Chiu and Lau that Chiu was an experienced investor and could assist Wei with investments. Among other things, Chiu and Lau told Wei that Chiu:
<P1>(a) had a Bachelor of Commerce from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia and a Masters of Business Administration from Brown University;</P1>
<P1>(b) had considerable experience in investing as a result of high level positions with Goldman Sachs' offices in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore;</P1>
<P1>(c) had been responsible for managing a portfolio of USD$20 billion for institutional clients;</P1>
<P1>(d) had worked as a consultant for companies, like a Singapore state-owned holding company named Temasek, where he had made approximately USD$2 million per year;</P1>
<P1>(e) Chiu owned a number of properties in different countries; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Lau owned a property in London, United Kingdom.</P1></P>
<P>11. Wei was persuaded by Chiu and Lau to allow them to assist Wei with making investments. Thereafter, from time to time, Chiu would make recommendations to Wei regarding what companies and markets she should invest in. In particular, Chiu recommended that Wei invest in:
<P1>(a) an IPO being issued by TransUnion;</P1>
<P1>(b) an IPO being issued by Ferrari NV;</P1>
<P1>(c) an IPO being issued by Airbnb; and</P1>
<P1>(d) the UK stock market.</P1></P>
<P>12. In order to facilitate investing in these companies and the UK market, Wei transferred funds to Chiu and Lau, primarily through a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce account held in the name of Lau. The funds were provided by Wei on the understanding that they would be used by Chiu to purchase shares, on Wei's behalf, using his retirement account with Goldman Sachs.</P>
<P>13. From 2015 to 2016, in reliance upon the above representations made by Chiu and Lau, Wei provided over USDS1.1 million to Chiu and Lau for the purpose of Chiu purchasing investments on Wei's behalf and to be held in trust for her.</P>
<P>14. On November 26, 2016, Wei requested that Chiu sell the investments he was holding in trust for her and return the sale proceeds to her. Chiu told Wei that for tax reasons he was unable to sell her shares in his Goldman Sachs account until the following tax year, starting on April 1, 2017.</P>
<P>15. At that time, Chiu executed a promissory note confirming that he owed Wei USD$1.25 million on account of her investments (and the return thereon) and promising to repay that amount on April 1, 2017. Chiu agreed to offer, as security for the amount owed, property he held at XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Ocean Drive Property</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>16. On March 28, 2017, Chiu told Wei that he was not able to return her money on April 1, 2017, because he and Lau were in the process of divorcing. Chiu requested that Wei execute a loan agreement with respect to the funds Wei had provided to Chiu and Lau. Wei refused to execute the loan agreement.</P>
<P>17. Thereafter, Chiu and Wei met on April 6 and 9, 2017. At those meetings, Chiu provided Wei with USD$14,000 and USD$20,000, respectively. At the April 9 meeting, Chiu again asked Wei to execute a loan agreement and Wei refused.</P>
<P>18. Chiu and Wei also arranged to meet on Sunday, May 14, 2017, at which time Chiu had promised to return USD$70,000 to Wei, but on May 12 Chiu called Wei and cancelled the May 14 meeting. Chiu told Wei that he might wire transfer the promised funds to her on Monday, May 15. As of the date of this Notice of Application, Chiu has not wired or otherwise provided to Wei the USD$70,000 he promised to return to her.</P>
<P>19. As of the date of this Notice of Application, Chiu has only repaid USD$34,000 of the more than USD$1.1 million Wei provided to Chiu and Lau for the sole purpose of Chiu purchasing shares on behalf of and in trust for Wei.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Investigative Efforts to Date</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. Starting in the fall of 2016, Wei retained three private investigators&mdash;one each in British Columbia, Hong Kong and Singapore&mdash;to look into Chiu to try to verify Chiu's identity and the representations he and Lau had made to Wei.</P>
<P>21. The private investigators determined, among other things, that:
<P1>a. Chiu did not attend the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business during the period he advised Wei he had attended that school;</P1>
<P1>b. Chiu did not attend Brown University;</P1>
<P1>c. Chiu was not employed with Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC or Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte. Ltd, Petronas Petroliam Nasional Berhad or Temasek Holdings Private Limited;</P1>
<P1>d. Chiu had previously worked in Calgary, Albert for Stoneset Asia Equities (&ldquo;<BOLD>Stoneset Equities</BOLD>&rdquo;), part of the Stoneset group of companies, and been involved in a major equities scandal around 2011;</P1>
<P1>e. Stoneset Equities is listed on Alberta Investors Protection's website under the heading &ldquo;Alberta EMD Failed/Failing Investments&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>f. there were no properties registered in the United Kingdom in the name of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau; and</P1>
<P1>g. Chiu had an outstanding debt of $34,000 owed to the Royal Bank.</P1></P>
<P>22. In addition, one of the private investigators determined that the Ocean Drive Property was owed by a company called Interlocal Exim Pte. Ltd. and that Chiu did not appear to own property in Singapore.</P>
<P>23. After being advised by the private investigator of that information, Wei asked Chiu about the Ocean Drive Property and he told her that for tax purposes he had used a number of companies to put a lot of layers between himself and properties he owned. Chiu also told Wei that some of the companies he used were companies in the British Virgin Islands.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Use of Funds by Chiu and Lau</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. The uses of the funds provided by Wei are best known to Chiu and Lau, who have knowingly failed to disclose those uses to Wei. At this time, and despite requests being made from time to time, Wei does not have any documents, save for investment summaries prepared by Chiu and Lau, showing what shares or assets were acquired using her funds, and she does not know how the funds provided by her were used beyond what was represented by Chiu and Lau.</P>
<P>25. Notwithstanding the above, Chiu has recently advised Wei that he is unable, at this time, to return her funds to her because he and Lau are in the process of divorcing.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Dissipation of Assets</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. In addition to Chiu advising Wei that he is unable to return her funds to her, in part, because of his personal circumstances, at different times, Chiu has told Wei that he uses various companies to put ownership layers between himself and property he owns.</P>
<P>27. Chiu has also recommended to Wei that she open a bank account in the British Virgin Islands to hold her investments.</P>
<P>28. Further, Chiu has recently refused to meet with Wei and indicated that he may travel to Hong Kong.</P>
<P>29. Wei has a real concern that Chiu and Lau may transfer or hide assets, and may leave British Columbia taking assets with them.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Defendants' CIBC Bank Accounts</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. Between 2015 and 2016, Chiu and Lau both used a bank account in Lau's name with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce branch located at 2904 Granville Street, Vancouver (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), in order receive funds from Wei.</P>
<P>31. During that period of time, and under the direction of Chiu and Lau, Wei transferred over USD$1 million into the CIBC Account on the understanding that those funds would be used by Chiu and Lau solely to purchase shares on behalf of and to be held in trust for Wei.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Defendants' Other Bank Accounts</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. in or around February 2017, Chiu showed Wei a summary of what he indicated were her investments. On the back of the summary was banking information for Chiu or Lau from TD Bank.</P>
<P>33. In early 2017, Wei also went to see a movie with Chiu at Cineplex. At that time, Chiu used a SCENE card, which is a rewards program linked to Scotiabank.</P>
<P>34. As a result, Wei has reason to believe that Chiu, Lau or both of them have bank accounts with TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Undertaking as to Damages</UNDER></TI>
<P>35. Wei has executed an undertaking to abide by any order the court may make as to damages if the injunction sought is granted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>36. The court has the discretion to grant a Mareva injunction enjoining a defendant from dissipating or removing assets from the court's jurisdiction before trial.</P>
<P>37. The test for the granting of a Mareva injunction is whether the plaintiff has established the following:
<P1>(a) a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> or good arguable case;</P1>
<P1>(b) the defendant has assets and that there is a real risk of their disposal or dissipation, so as to render nugatory any judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(c) that, having regard to all relevant factors, the balance of justice and convenience favours the plaintiff's application.</P1>

<P>38. The consideration of whether to grant a Mareva injunction requires a flexible approach and the fundamental question will be whether the granting of the injunction is just and equitable in all of the circumstances of the case.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Patko</EM> at para. 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. While a Mareva injunction is an exceptional remedy and is an exception to the practice of the court not requiring security before judgment, such an order may be justified where there is a genuine risk of dissipation of assets. The root underlying Mareva injunctions is the risk of harm either through the dissipation or removal of assets. Further, fraud is an exception to the general hostility to prejudgment execution.

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Strong Prima Facie Case</EM></TI>
<P>40. A strict formulation should not be applied to determine whether the plaintiff has put forward a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> or good arguable case. The standard is higher than &ldquo;arguable case&rdquo;, but less than the &ldquo;bound to succeed&rdquo; threshold.
<P1><EM>Tracy</EM> at para. 54.</P1></P>
<P>41. The Plaintiff has provided evidence demonstrating that she provided significant funds to the Defendants based on the misrepresentations provided by them in respect to Chiu's education and investment experience, and that these funds or any investments purchased by them were to be held in trust for the Plaintiff. With the exception of USD$34,000, the Defendants have failed to re-pay the principal amounts held in trust by them for the Plaintiff or, in the alternative, the Defendants have failed to transfer to the Plaintiff any investments held by them in trust for the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>42. Further, Chiu has admitted that he owes Wei USD$1.25 million on account of the funds provided by Wei to Chiu and Lau, along with interest, and promised to repay this amount by April 1, 2017. Contrary to Chiu's promises and representations, at the current date, Chiu has only repaid USD$34,000 of this amount.</P>
<P>43. The evidence presented by the Plaintiff on this application clearly establishes that the Plaintiff has a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Real Risk of Dissipation of Assets</EM></TI>
<P>44. A risk of dissipation of assets may be inferred from the evidence related to the plaintiff's strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case. Such an inference may be justified in circumstances involving fraud.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Musson</EM> at para. 16;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Netolitzky v. Barclay</SOC><CITE>2002 BCSC 1098</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>; and</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Insurance Corp. of British Columbia v. Leland</SOC><CITE>1999 CarswellBC 1998</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM><COURTJUR>S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. The Plaintiff has presented clear evidence that she has a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case involving a breach of trust and fraud.</P>
<P>46. Further, the Plaintiff has presented evidence that there is a real risk that the Defendants will hide assets or leave the jurisdiction taking assets with them.</P>
<P>47. The circumstances of this case justify the court making an inference that there is a risk that the Defendants will dissipate their assets.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Balance of Justice and Convenience</EM></TI>
<P>48. In <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. CKPG Television Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>64 B.C.L.R. (2d) 96</CITE></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal set out factors to be considered under balance of convenience. It noted this list is not exhaustive and the relevant factors will vary from case to case:
<P1>(a) the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the applicant if the injunction is not granted and for the respondent if an injunction is granted;</P1>
<P1>(b) the likelihood that if damages are finally awarded they will be paid;</P1>
<P1>(c) the preservation of contested property;</P1>
<P1>(d) other factors affecting whether harm from the granting or refusal of the injunction would be irreparable;</P1>
<P1>(e) which of the parties has acted to alter the balance of their relationship and so affect the status quo;</P1>
<P1>(f) the strength of the applicant's case;</P1>
<P1>(g) any factors affecting the public interest; and</P1>
<P1>(h) any other factors affecting the balance of justice and convenience.</P1></P>
<P>49. With respect to (b) and (d), the Plaintiff will likely have difficulty collecting an award of damages if the Mareva order sought herein is not granted due to the real risk that the Defendants will dissipate or dispose of their assets. There is therefore a substantial risk that damages will not be paid.</P>
<P>50. With respect to (f), the strength of the Plaintiff's case also supports the relief sought herein. Chiu has admitted to owing a significant sum of money to the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>51. In sum, if a protection order is not granted and the Plaintiff's claim succeeds, she will in all likelihood be left without a remedy. In contrast, if a protection order is issued and the plaintiff's claim fails, then the Defendants' assets will have been preserved and all that will have been lost is the ability of the Defendants to sell or otherwise deal with their property for a period of time. To mitigate any such prejudice, the Plaintiff has executed an undertaking as to damages.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Norwich Pharmacal Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>52. A defrauded plaintiff has an equitable right to trace his or her money. For the purpose of giving effect to that right, the court has the discretion to order a third party to disclose information or documents relating to the assets of the alleged fraudster. Such orders are commonly referred to as a &ldquo;Norwich Pharmacal Order&rdquo;.</P>
<P>53. The granting of a Norwich Pharmacal Order is an exceptional remedy, but it may be justified to trace funds and to give effect to a Mareva injunction to prevent the dissipation of assets.</P>
<P>54. When determining whether to grant a Norwich Pharmacal Order, the court will consider the following factors:
<P1>(a) whether the applicant has provided evidence sufficient to raise a valid, bona fide or reasonable claim;</P1>
<P1>(b) whether the application has established a relationship with the third party from whom the information is sought such that it establishes that the third party is somehow involved in the acts complained of;</P1>
<P1>(c) whether the third party is the only practical source of information available;</P1>
<P1>(d) whether the third party can be indemnified for costs to which the third party may be exposed because of the disclosure; and</P1>
<P1>(e) whether the interest of justice favour the obtaining of disclosure.</P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Musson</EM> at para. 17; and</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Gold Bullion Development Corp. v. Stockhouse Publishing Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 784</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. With respect to (a) and (d), as discussed above, the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish that it has a bona fide or reasonable claim and has undertaken to pay any costs awarded by the court.</P>
<P>56. With respect to (b), Lau holds a bank account with CIBC, which was used by both Defendants and directly involved in the operation of the Defendants' purported investment scheme. In particular, it was into this account that the Plaintiff transferred funds at the request of the Defendants.</P>
<P>57. In addition, the Plaintiff has presented evidence that Chiu, Lau or both of them likely hold bank accounts with TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank.</P>
<P>58. Further, CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank provide the only practical source of information regarding the Defendants' bank accounts, as it is unlikely that the Defendants will disclose accurate and complete information about their financial affairs.</P>
<P>59. In the circumstances of this case, the balance of justice favours the granting of an order that CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank provide the Plaintiff with information about the Defendants' bank accounts to allow the Plaintiff to trace its funds.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI>Freezing Order</TI>
<P>1. Except as permitted by this Order, the defendants must not:
<P1>(a) remove from British Columbia or in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets that are in British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned;</P1>
<P1>(b) in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned.</P1>
<P1>(c) This prohibition applies to all of the defendants' assets, and includes the following assets in particular:
<P2>(i) any real property held in the name of or for the benefit of the defendants, or either of them;</P2>
<P2>(ii) the property and assets of the defendants' businesses or the net proceeds from the sale of the asset or assets if any of them have been sold; and</P2>
<P2>(iii) any money in the accounts numbered or safety deposit boxes with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank.</P2></P1></P>
<P>2. If the total value of the defendants' assets in British Columbia, net of all secured interests, exceeds $1.5 million, the defendants may remove any of those assets from British Columbia or may dispose of or deal with them so long as the total net value of their assets still in British Columbia remains above $1.5 million.</P>
<P>3. If the total net value of the defendants' assets in British Columbia does not exceed $1.5 million, the defendants must not remove any of those assets from British Columbia and must not dispose of or deal with any of them, but if they have other assets outside British Columbia the defendants may dispose of or deal with those assets so long as the total net value of all their assets whether in or outside British Columbia remains above $1.5 million.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Exceptions to this Order</TI>
<P>4. This Order does not prohibit the defendants from spending $3,500.00 each per month on ordinary living expenses and a total of $25,000.00 each per month on legal advice and representation. Before spending any money on living, business or legal expenses, the defendant must advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of the funds.</P>
<P>5. The defendants may agree with the plaintiff that the above spending limits should be increased or that this Order should be relaxed in any other respect but any such agreement will be effective only if confirmed in writing and signed by all parties.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Duration of this Order</TI>
<P>6. Unless this Order is varied or discharged or extended by order of the Court, this Order shall remain in force until the expiry of 30 days following the pronouncement of final judgment in this matter by this Court, including any necessary assessment of damages but not the assessment of costs or completion of all execution proceedings.</P>
<P>7. This Order will cease to have effect if the defendants provide security by paying the sum of $1.5 million into Court or makes provision for security in that sum by some other method agreed in writing with the plaintiff.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Variation or Discharge of this Order</TI>
<P>8. Anyone affected by this Order may apply to the Court at any time to vary or discharge it, or to request that the plaintiff be required to post security for the undertaking, on giving no less than 24 hours' notice to the plaintiffs solicitor of his or her intention to do so, but this Order will remain in force until further Order even if such an application is pending.</P>
<P>9. All applications to vary or discharge this Order, or arising out of the issuance or enforcement of this Order, shall be heard by the Judge who issued this Order with the exception of:
<P1>(a) urgent matters for which the Judge is not available; or</P1>
<P1>(b) as otherwise directed by the Judge.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Third Parties</TI>
<P>10. Except as permitted by this Order, no person or other legal entity with notice of this Order may deal with any bank or other accounts of the defendants (including money market, retirement savings plan accounts, investment certificates, treasury bills, and deposits) or with other assets of the defendants in his or her possession or control.</P>
<P>11. No person or other legal entity with notice of this Order shall breach or permit a breach of this Order.</P>
<P>12. To the extent that any person or other legal entity holds assets of the defendants in excess of $1.5 million, that person or other legal entity is not restrained from dealing with that part of the assets held by that person or other legal entity which is i n excess of $1.5 million.</P>
<P>13. The terms of this Order do not affect any person or legal entity outside the jurisdiction of this Court unless and until this Order is declared enforceable or is enforced by a Court in the relevant jurisdiction, except that this Order is enforceable as against a person or other legal entity who or which:
<P1>(a) is a defendant or an officer or an agent of a defendant; or</P1>
<P1>(b) is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court and has been given written notice of this Order.</P1></P>
<P>14. This Order does not prevent any bank, financial institution or secured party from exercising any rights to claim interest, to levy service charges, to claim set off, to enforce security, or to enforce any other contractual right, arising from contracts made before being notified of this Order.</P>
<P>15. No bank or financial institution needs to enquire as to the application or proposed application of any money withdrawn by the defendants if the withdrawal appears to be permitted by this Order.</P>
<P>16. This Order binds every defendant and every other person who is subject to this Order and obtains notice of the Order, as of the time such defendant or person first receives notice of the Order, and whether or not such defendant or person has been served with a copy of the Order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Disclosure Order</TI>
<P>17. Each of the defendants must, within seven days of service of this Order, provide the plaintiffs solicitor with a list (the &ldquo;Defendants' Asset Lists&rdquo;), verified by his, her or its affidavit setting out all of the defendants' assets as of the date of this Order whether in or outside British Columbia and whether in that defendant's own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned, and details of all such assets, including the nature of each asset, all identifying numbers and other identifying information, its exact location as of the date of this Order, and whether the asset is held in the defendant's name or jointly held with another person, or by another on his, her or its behalf.</P>
<P>18. If a defendant holds any assets over which he or she has no beneficial interest, that asset shall be included in the list, along with an indication that the asset is held in trust for others.</P>
<P>19. The plaintiff's solicitor shall not disclose the Defendants' Asset Lists or the information contained in them to any person (including the plaintiff) except for the purpose of this proceeding. Before making such disclosure, counsel shall obtain a written undertaking from the person to whom disclosure is to be made in the form attached to this Order as Schedule &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</P>
<P>20. On or before the day following the pronouncement of final judgment in this matter by this Court, or such later date as provided in a further order, the plaintiff's solicitor shall destroy all copies of the Defendants' Asset Lists received from the defendant and take reasonable steps to ensure that any copies released to anyone else are destroyed, except that the plaintiff is at liberty to file with the Court a sealed copy of the Defendants' Asset Lists, to be retained in the Court file so that it will be available on further court order.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</TI>
<P>1. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (&ldquo;CIBC&rdquo;), TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank shall within 15 days of service of this order, produce and disclose to counsel for the plaintiff, Dentons Canada LLP, the following:

<P1>(b) all correspondence related to the Accounts;</P1>
<P1>(c) copies of all records, including but not limited to all account statements, agreements, cancelled cheques and debit vouchers, transfer applications and orders, internal memoranda, wire transfer documentation, bank drafts, cheques and other instruments, which pertain in any way to the Accounts for the period January 1, 2015 to the date of this order; and</P1>
<P1>(d) records of any safety deposit boxes held by either individually or jointly, by Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu, Queenie Lau and Queenie Chiu.</P1></P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff may apply to the court following delivery of the information set out in the preceding paragraph of the order to vary the terms of this order.</P>
<P>3. CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank, and their respective officers and employees are directed not to advise their customers or any other person (other than legal counsel for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, in which case such counsel is likewise precluded from notifying any person) of the existence of these proceedings, the existence of this order, or the fact that they have provided records pursuant to this order.</P>
<P>4. The Plaintiff shall reimburse CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank for the reasonable administrative costs of complying with this order, upon delivery of an invoice to counsel for the Plaintiff following delivery of the information and documents as per this order.</P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI>ORDER MADE AFTER APPLICATION</TI>
<P>ON THE APPLICATION of the plaintiff coming before me at Vancouver BC on May 18, 2017, and on hearing Craig Dennis Q.C., counsel for the plaintiff, and nobody, attending for the defendants, and on reading:
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Rong Wei made 12/May/2017.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #1 of John Hilpert made 12/May/2017.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #2 of Rong Wei made 16/May/2017.</P1></P>
<P>AND ON the plaintiff having undertaken to comply with the terms of the undertaking set out in Schedule &ldquo;1&rdquo; to this Order;</P>
<P>THIS COURT ORDERS AND DIRECTS THAT:</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>FREEZING ORDER</TI>
<P>1. Except as permitted by this Order, the defendants must not:
<P1>a) remove from British Columbia or in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets that are in British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned;</P1>
<P1>b) in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned.</P1>
<P1>c) This prohibition applies to all of the defendants' assets, and includes the following assets in particular:
<P2>i. any real property held in the name of or for the benefit of the defendants, or either of them;</P2>

<P2>iii. any money in the accounts numbered or safety deposit boxes with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank.</P2></P1></P>
<P>2. If the total value of the defendants' assets in British Columbia, net of all secured interests, exceeds $1.5 million, the defendants may remove any of those assets from British Columbia or may dispose of or deal with them so long as the total net value of their assets still in British Columbia remains above $1.5 million.</P>
<P>3. If the total net value of the defendants' assets in British Columbia does not exceed $1.5 million, the defendants must not remove any of those assets from British Columbia and must not dispose of or deal with any of them, but if they have other assets outside British Columbia the defendants may dispose of or deal with those assets so long as the total net value of all their assets whether in or outside British Columbia remains above $1.5 million.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ORDER</TI>
<P>4. This Order does not prohibit the defendants from spending $3,500.00 each per month on ordinary living expenses and a total of $25,000.00 each on legal advice and representation. Before spending any money on living, business or legal expenses, the defendant must advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of the funds.</P>
<P>5. The defendants may agree with the plaintiff that the above spending limits should be increased or that this Order should be relaxed in any other respect but any such agreement will be effective only if confirmed in writing and signed by all parties.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>DURATION OF THIS ORDER</TI>
<P>6. Unless this Order is varied or discharged or extended by order of the Court, this Order shall remain in force until the expiry of 30 days following the pronouncement of final judgment in this matter by this Court, including any necessary assessment of damages but not the assessment of costs or completion of all execution proceedings.</P>
<P>7. This Order will cease to have effect if the defendants provide security by paying the sum of $1.5 million into Court or makes provision for security in that sum by some other method agreed in writing with the plaintiff.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>VARIATION OR DISCHARGE OF THIS ORDER</TI>
<P>8. Anyone affected by this Order may apply to the Court at any time to vary or discharge it, or to request that the plaintiff be required to post security for the undertaking, on giving no less than 24 hours' notice to the plaintiffs solicitor of his or her intention to do so, but this Order will remain in force until further Order even if such an application is pending.</P>
<P>9. All applications to vary or discharge this Order, or arising out of the issuance or enforcement of this Order, shall be heard by the Judge who issued this Order with the exception of:
<P1>a) urgent matters for which the Judge is not available; or</P1>
<P1>b) as otherwise directed by the Judge.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THIRD PARTIES</TI>
<P>10. Except as permitted by this Order, no person or other legal entity with notice of this Order may deal with any bank or other accounts of the defendants (including money market, retirement savings plan accounts, investment certificates, treasury bills, and deposits) or with other assets of the defendants in his or her possession or control.</P>
<P>11. No person or other legal entity with notice of this Order shall breach or permit a breach of this Order.</P>
<P>12. To the extent that any person or other legal entity holds assets of the defendants in excess of $1.5 million, that person or other legal entity is not restrained from dealing with that part of the assets held by that person or other legal entity which is in excess of $1.5 million.</P>
<P>13. The terms of this Order do not affect any person or legal entity outside the jurisdiction of this Court unless and until this Order is declared enforceable or is enforced by a Court in the relevant jurisdiction, except that this Order is enforceable as against a person or other legal entity who or which:
<P1>a) is a defendant or an officer or an agent of a defendant; or</P1>
<P1>b) is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court and has been given written notice of this Order.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>NOTICE OF APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P><BOLD>Name of applicant: Rong Wei</BOLD></P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an EX PARTE application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge at the courthouse at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia on 16/Aug/2017 at 9:45 am for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. Leave of this Court to:
<P1>a) apply for, in aid of the within proceeding, an injunction or preservation order pursuant to s. 21M of the High Court Ordinance and ancillary disclosure orders before the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the &ldquo;Hong Kong Proceeding&rdquo;); and</P1>
<P1>b) rely on the Defendants' Asset Lists as defined under the Order of Madam Justice Humphries dated May 18, 2017 in the Hong Kong Proceeding.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Background to Canadian Action</EM></TI>
<P>2. The background to this action is summarized in the plaintiff's first affidavit, relied on in support of the mareva order made by Madam Justice Humphries dated May 18, 2017 (the &ldquo;Mareva Order&rdquo;) in this proceeding:
<P1>a) Wei provided over USD $1.1 million to Chiu and Lau, for them to make certain investments on her behalf (paragraph 64);</P1>
<P1>b) Chiu and Lau induced Wei to provide these funds based on representations that, among other things, such funds would be used by Chiu to purchase shares for Wei, Chiu had considerable experience in investing as a result of a high level position with Goldman Sachs, and that Chiu owned properties around the world (paragraphs 64, 66 and 5);</P1>
<P1>c) Wei understood that any shares purchased using the funds she provided to Chiu and Lau would be held on her behalf and in trust for her (paragraph 65);</P1>
<P1>d) Wei subsequently learned, through investigative efforts, that the representations made to her by Chiu and Lau were false (paragraphs 90 to 93); and</P1>
<P1>e) Despite repeated demands, with the exceptions of USD $34,000, Chiu and Lau have failed to return to Wei the funds she provided to them (paragraphs 70 to 78).</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Mareva Order of May 18, 2017</EM></TI>
<P>3. The terms of the Mareva Order, and related disclcosure order, include among others:
<P1>a) Chiu and Lau must provide the plaintiff's solicitor with a list (the &ldquo;Defendants' Asset Lists&rdquo;) verified by affidavit setting out all of their assets as of the date of the Mareva Order (paragraph 17);</P1>
<P1>b) the plaintiff's solicitor shall not disclose the Defendants' Asset Lists or the information contained in them to any person (including the plaintiff) except for the purposes of this proceeding and before making such disclosure, counsel shall obtain a written undertaking in form attached as Schedule 2 to the Mareva Order (paragraph 19);</P1>
<P1>c) The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (&ldquo;CIBC&rdquo;) must provide a list of all accounts held by Chiu and Lau, and all supporting records in respect thereof (paragraph 21).</P1></P>
<P>4. CIBC was implicated in the Mareva Order because it was through a CIBC account, maintained by Lau, that Wei transferred funds to Chiu and Lau.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Defendants' Asset Lists</EM></TI>
<P>5. On or around June 21, 2017, Chiu and Lau, through counsel who was since been retained by them, provided the Defendants' Asset Lists to the plaintiff's solicitor.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>CIBC Records</EM></TI>
<P>6. In May and June 2017, the plaintiff's solicitor also received banking records from CIBC in respect of accounts maintained by Lau (the &ldquo;CIBC Records&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. The CIBC Records, among other things, indicate that in May 2017 Ms. Lau transferred approximately USD $275,000 in funds to an account in Hong Kong. Of that amount, USD $100,000 was transferred after the application for the Mareva Order was substitutionally served on Lau.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Hong Kong Proceeding</EM></TI>
<P>8. In light of the foregoing transfers evident in the CIBC records, and information contained in the Defendants' Asset Lists, Wei intends to apply in Hong Kong for an <EM>ex parte</EM> injunction or preservation order pursuant to s. 21M of the High Court Ordinance and ancillary disclosure orders respecting the Hong Kong based banks used by Chiu and Lau (the &ldquo;Hong Kong Proceeding&rdquo;).</P>
<P>9. In light of the extant Mareva Order, Wei seeks leave to:
<P1>a) commence the Hong Kong Proceeding, given paragraph 9 of the Mareva Order (which provides that any application arising out of the enforcement of the Mareva Order be heard by the Judge who issued the Order); and</P1>
<P1>b) rely on the Defendants' Assets Lists in the Hong Kong Proceeding, given paragraph 19 of the Mareva Order (which prevents the plaintiff's solicitor from disclosing the Defendants Asset Lists unless a written undertaking is first obtained).</P1></P>
<P>10. The disclosure of the Defendants' Assets Lists is required to ensure full and frank disclosure is made in the Hong Kong Proceeding.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Other Relevant Information</EM></TI>
<P>11. In paragraph 9 of the Mareva Order, applications arising out of the enforcement of the Mareva Order are to be heard by Madam Justice Humphries, the Judge who issued the Mareva Order. We have sought to reappear before Madam Justice Humphries but have been advised that she is unavailable to hear this application.</P>
<P>12. Although the defendants have not yet filed a Response to Civil Claim, they have retained Poulsen &amp; Company to act for them in this matter. Counsel for the defendants has advised that there was a close personal relationship between Wei and Chiu and that they were essentially conducting themselves as spouses, sharing various expenses, making and forgiving loans and treating one another's assets as joint property in contemplation of formalizing their spousal relationship, as well as that Chiu was told he did not need to worry about any sums Wei had given him and that he could consider those amounts to be gifts.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>13. This Court has already granted the Mareva Order and in doing so been satisfied that the plaintiff has a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case and that the worldwide order is just and equitable in all of the circumstances of the case.</P>
<P>14. What the plaintiff is now seeking from the Hong Kong court is an order extending the Mareva Order to Hong Kong, and disclosure orders to assist in its enforcement.</P>
<P>15. Wei's request for an order that she be permitted to use the Defendants' Assets Lists in the Hong Kong Proceeding is, it is submitted, analogous to a request by a party for the court to waive the implied undertaking that attaches to discovery evidence and documents produced in an action.</P>
<P>16. The test for granting an order waiving the implied undertaking is whether the interests of justice outweigh any prejudice that would result to the party that disclosed the evidence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Tekavec</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 1348</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>17. In cases where discovery evidence in one action is sought to be used in another action with the same or similar parties and issues, the prejudice to the examinee is virtually non-existent and leave will generally be granted.
<P1><EM>Tekavec</EM> at para. 15.</P1></P>
<P>18. The parties to the Hong Kong Proceeding are the same as the parties to the within proceedings, and the purpose for which Wei is seeking to use the Defendants' Assets Lists is directly related to the purpose for which the Defendants' Assets Lists were produced in these proceedings.</P>
<P>19. In the circumstances, the balance of justice favours the granting of an order permitting Wei to use the Defendants' Assets Lists in the Hong Kong Proceeding.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>4. An order that Ms. Lau deliver an Amended List of Documents that lists all of the documents that are or have been in her possession or control that could, if available, be used to prove or disprove a material fact, as well as all other documents Ms. Lau intends to refer to at trial (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Amended List of Documents</BOLD>&rdquo;) within 14 days of the order of this Court.</P>

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Overview of Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. This case concerns the actions of Allan Chiu and his wife Queenie Lau, who between 2015 and 2016 induced the plaintiff, Rong (Eliza) Wei, to pay them approximately USD$1.1 million to invest on her behalf.</P>
<P>12. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau did not invest the funds they received from Ms. Wei and did not provide Ms. Wei a return on her investment. Instead, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau defrauded Ms. Wei and converted Ms. Wei's funds to their own uses. Despite repeated demands, with the exception of USD$34,000, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau have failed to return to Ms. Wei the funds that she provided to them.</P>
<P>13. On May 18, 2017 Humphries J. granted a Mareva injunction against the defendants which, among other terms, restrained use of their assets.</P>
<P>14. The defendants' misconduct and deceit that gave rise to the need for the plaintiff to bring this claim has carried over into the defendants' defence of the claim.</P>
<P>15. On September 27, 2018, Ms. Lau failed to attend a scheduled examination for discovery in Vancouver. Ms. Lau's counsel advised both before and after the examination that Ms. Lau could not attend the examination because she was in China and unable to travel due to a medical condition. That was false. On the days leading up to and on September 27, Ms. Lau was observed by a private investigator at several locations in Vancouver with her husband, including playing tennis, shopping at an outlet mall and driving a new BMW registered in her name that was acquired after the commencement of this proceeding.</P>
<P>16. Ms. Lau's wilful failure to attend her examination for discovery is a continuation of a course of conduct that can only be described as obstructive. Ms. Lau has been dilatory in providing document disclosure, only producing a list of documents after required by court order. In addition, Ms. Lau is in breach of the terms of a Mareva injunction requiring that she provide Ms. Wei's solicitors with notice of the intended source of funds before she spends any money on her allotted $3,500 a month for living and business expenses. Neither Ms. Lau nor her husband have provided the required information since December 2017.</P>
<P>17. Ms. Wei brings this application seeking an order striking Ms. Lau's response to civil claim for her wilful refusal to attend her examination for discovery. Ms. Wei also seeks an order that Ms. Lau be found in contempt for her non-attendance, as well as for her breach of the terms of the Mareva order.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural History</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Wei Obtains Mareva Injunction</EM></TI>
<P>18. Ms. Wei filed her notice of civil claim on May 12, 2017 claiming the sum of approximately $1.5 million on account of the principal amounts provided by Ms. Wei to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau. Ms. Wei also sought interim and permanent injunctive relief restraining the defendants from disposing of their assets, as well as equitable relief, including tracing orders and orders that the defendants hold any real and personal property as constructive trustees.</P>
<P>19. On May 16, 2017, Ms. Wei filed an application for a Mareva injunction and a Norwich Pharmaceutical Order.</P>
<P>20. On May 18, 2017, Humphries J. granted the orders sought by Ms. Wei (the &ldquo;<BOLD>May 2017 Order</BOLD>&rdquo;), including a Mareva injunction prohibiting the defendants from disposing of their assets.</P>
<P>21. The May 2017 Order was emailed to each of the defendants on May 19, 2017.</P>
<P>22. Based on the defendants' bank records subsequently obtained by Ms. Wei, from May 20, 2017 onward Mr. Chiu withdrew the following amounts from his Bank of China account in Hong Kong: $1,663,221.18 in HKD, $2,900.00 in CAD, and $123,545.73 in USD, for a total amount of $459,630.83 (CAD) based on the Bank of Canada foreign exchange rate posted on May 19, 2017. These withdrawals are in addition to, and not explained by, the exemptions allowed for the defendants under the May 2017 Order.</P>
<P>23. The May 2017 Order required the defendants to provide Ms. Wei's solicitor with an Asset List within seven days setting out all of the defendants' assets as of the date of the May 2017 Order.</P>
<P>24. The Asset Lists were provided by the defendants on June 21, 2017.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Defendants' Delay in Providing Document Discovery</EM></TI>
<P>25. Ms. Wei served her list of documents on October 23, 2017. Ms. Wei served an amended list of documents on November 9, 2017 listing additional documents.</P>
<P>26. Ms. Wei scheduled examinations for discovery of Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau in November 2017. Those examinations could not proceed, as the defendants' had yet to deliver their list of documents, despite several requests. They were adjourned by agreement.</P>
<P>27. On May 29, 2018, Ms. Wei filed an application seeking an order that the defendants deliver a list of documents.</P>
<P>28. On June 6, 2018, Master Vos ordered that the defendants deliver a list of documents within 21 days.</P>
<P>29. On July 3, 2018, the defendants served a list of documents. Despite Ms. Wei requesting copies of the documents on July 5, 2018, the documents were not delivered until August.</P>
<P>30. The defendants' list of documents is sparse and omits many classes of documents. For example, the defendants' list of documents omits banking records necessary for a proper tracing analysis.</P>
<P>31. By letter dated October 10, 2018, Ms. Wei made demand of the defendants pursuant to sub-rules 7-1(10) to (12) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> that the defendants' list of documents be amended to include the documents set out at Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; to this notice of application. To date, the defendants have not provided a response to the letter.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Lau Fails to Attend Scheduled Examination for Discovery on September 27, 2018</EM></TI>
<P>32. Throughout August 2018, Ms. Wei's counsel communicated with counsel for the defendants to attempt to schedule an examination for discovery of both defendants in the month of September, beginning with Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>33. Ms. Lau did not provide any available dates for a discovery in September. On September 6, 2018, counsel for the defendants advised that he was instructed that Ms. Lau was abroad dealing with a medical issue, and that he was seeking more information to assist in scheduling her examination.</P>
<P>34. On September 18, 2018, counsel for Ms. Wei followed-up with counsel for the defendants seeking further information on when Ms. Lau was expected to be back in the country.</P>
<P>35. On September 19, 2018, Ms. Wei served an appointment to examine for discovery Ms. Lau on September 27, 2018 at the offices of her counsel and attached conduct money.</P>
<P>36. On September 24, 2018, counsel for the defendants advised that he was instructed that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to travel for medical reasons. Counsel for the defendants explained that he understood that Ms. Lau had a blood disorder, and it was hoped it would resolve sufficiently by December so that she was in a position to travel then. Counsel for the defendants requested that the examination of Ms. Lau be rescheduled to December, as Ms. Lau was unable to attend the scheduled discovery on September 27, 2018.</P>
<P>37. On September 25, 2018, counsel for Ms. Wei advised counsel for the defendants that he would be attending the scheduled examination on September 27, 2018 to have the appointment stamped. Counsel for Ms. Wei offered to conduct a discovery of Mr. Chiu on that date, if he was available.</P>
<P>38. On September 26, 2018, counsel for the defendants sent an email to counsel for Ms. Wei reiterating that Ms. Lau was not available for the reasons previously expressed.</P>
<P>39. Ms. Lau did not attend at her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27. An endorsement of non-appearance was issued.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Lau was not in China on the Date of her Examination</EM></TI>
<P>40. The reason proffered by Ms. Lau's counsel on her behalf for her inability to attend her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27 was that she was in China and unable to travel to Vancouver for medical conditions. That was not true.</P>
<P>41. On September 24, the day Ms. Lau's counsel advised Ms. Wei's counsel that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to travel for medical reasons, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed by John Hilpert, a private investigator retained by Ms. Wei, at the McArthurGlen outlet mail in Richmond, British Columbia in a dark BMW vehicle.</P>
<P>42. During the afternoon of September 26, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed again by Mr. Hilpert at numerous locations in Vancouver, including playing tennis on the UBC campus, driving their BMW, walking a dog at a park and picking up their daughter at the Lansdowne Skytrain station. Mr. Hilpert observed that the BMW had an expired insurance sticker.</P>
<P>43. On September 27, the day of her scheduled examination, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed again by Mr. Hilpert at several locations in Vancouver.</P>
<P>44. On September 28, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were again observed by Mr. Hilpert at several locations in Vancouver, including attending the C!BC branch located at 4489 West 10<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, playing tennis on the UBC campus and going to the McArthurGlen outlet mall in Richmond.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Further Attempts to Schedule Discoveries of the Defendants</EM></TI>
<P>45. On October 4, 2018, counsel for Ms. Wei sent a letter to counsel for the defendants following up on Mr. Chiu's availability for an examination for discovery. Counsel for Ms. Wei also requested that Ms. Lau provide better information about her medical condition, including a doctor's note.</P>
<P>46. During the evening of October 9, 2018, counsel for the defendants sent a letter to counsel for Ms. Wei advising that Ms. Lau hoped that she would be well enough to travel for the purposes of an examination for discovery by December.</P>
<P>47. Counsel for the defendants further advised that Mr. Chiu no longer resides in Vancouver, and was also in China. However, on October 10 Mr. Hilpert once again observed Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau shopping at the Costco wholesale store in Richmond. Mr. Hilpert observed that Mr. Chiu was wearing a Cartier watch. Mr. Hilpert also observed that the defendants' BMW displayed a new 2019 insurance sticker.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Striking Ms. Chiu's Response to Civil Claim for Failure to Attend Examination</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. A party of record has an obligation to make him or herself available for an examination for discovery.
<P1>Rule 7-2(1)</P1></P>
<P>49. A person to be examined for discovery must attend and submit to an examination for discovery if the party wishing to conduct that examination has properly served an appointment and tendered witness fees.
<P1>Rule 7-2(14)</P1></P>
<P>50. Where a defendant, contrary to the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> and without lawful excuse, neglects to attend at the time and place appointed for his or her examination for discovery, the court may strike out the response to civil claim and order the proceeding to continue against that person as if no response to civil claim had been filed.
<P1>Rule 22-7(2) and (5)</P1></P>
<P>51. The court may also make any other order it thinks fit, including an order requiring the party to attend a rescheduled examination for discovery.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Tsoukas v. Ruocco</SOC><CITE>2004 BCSC 1384</CITE><PARANUM>7 and 10</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>52. While courts often allow for a two-step process on an application to strike for nonattendance at an examination for discovery, there is no fixed rule. An order to strike pleadings is usually only made after the second non-attendance at discovery. However, each case will depend on its facts. For example, where the evidence is clear that a defendant has engaged in obstructive conduct, the court will be more willing to apply the sanction of striking the defence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Han v. Cho</SOC><CITE>2008 BCSC 1621</CITE><PARANUM>19&ndash;21</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Kalcsa v. Read Media Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 248</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>636023 B.C. Ltd. v. A-Millenia Construction Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2005 BCSC 1563</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>53. The facts of this case merit an order that Ms. Lau's response to civil claim be struck.</P>
<P>54. The reason offered by Ms. Lau, through counsel, in the days leading up to the date of her scheduled examination for her inability to attend was that she was in China and unable to travel to Vancouver due to medical reasons. That was not true. Ms. Lau was in Vancouver with her husband in the days leading up to the examination and on the date of the examination. She was seen playing tennis, walking her dog and going shopping.</P>
<P>55. The defendants' deceit continued after Ms. Lau's missed examination for discovery, when the defendants (again through their counsel) advised Ms. Wei approximately two weeks later that both of them were residing in China and that Ms. Lau remained unable to travel to Vancouver. Once again, that was not true. Both Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau were in Vancouver.</P>
<P>56. There can be no lawful excuse for Ms. Lau's failure to attend her examination for discovery on September 27, 2018. She avoided her obligation to attend a discovery by attempting to deliberately mislead Ms. Wei about her ability to attend.</P>
<P>57. Ms. Lau's untruthfulness is sufficient in and of itself to justify an order striking her defence. The appropriateness of that order is compounded when considered alongside her dilatory attitude to document production and her continued attempt to delay being examined for discovery after her missed appointment by repeating the fiction that she is in China and unable to travel for medical reasons.</P>
<P>58. Ms. Lau's response to civil claim should be struck and the proceeding continued against her as if no response to civil claim had been filed.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Variation of May 2017 Order due to Defendants' Non-Compliance</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. As noted, the May 2017 Order includes a Mareva injunction prohibiting the defendants from, among other things, disposing of or dealing with or diminishing the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia.</P>
<P>60. Paragraph 4 to the May 2017 Order sets out the following exception to the order:
<QUOTE><P>This Order does not prohibit the defendants from spending $3,500.00 each per month on ordinary living expenses and a total of $25,000.00 each on legal advice and representation. <UNDER>Before spending any money on living, business or legal expenses, the defendant must advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of the funds</UNDER>. (Emphasis added.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. As is evident, the order requires that the defendants advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of funds for living expenses <UNDER>before</UNDER> any money is spent.</P>
<P>62. For the first several months after the issuance of the May 2017 Order, the defendants, through their counsel, advised the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of funds before funds were spent on living expenses.</P>
<P>63. However, since approximately December of 2017 the defendants have not been providing the plaintiff's solicitors with advance notice in writing of the intended source of funds for living expenses.</P>
<P>64. The result is that Ms. Lau is not complying with the May 2017 Order, as she is spending money on living and business expenses without first advising the plaintiff's solicitors of the intended source of the funds.</P>
<P>65. As an example from prior to December 2017, a PPRS search of the BMW being driven by Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau reveals a PPSA Security Agreement registered in favour of BMW Canada Inc. on September 27, 2017. The base debtor is listed as &ldquo;Mui Queenie Chiu&rdquo;. Ms. Lau did not advise the plaintiff's solicitors before spending money in September 2017 of the intended source of funds for the expenses in acquiring their BMW, or before paying for the insurance renewal in the fall of 2018.</P>
<P>66. As a consequence of Ms. Lau's continued non-compliance with paragraph 4 of the May 2017 Order, Ms. Wei seeks an order varying her monthly living expenses from $3,500 to $1,000 until such time as she provides a full accounting of her monthly living expenses from December 2017 to the present date and identifies the source of the funds for those living expenses. Ms. Wei also seeks as part of the order that Ms. Wei be required to produce to the plaintiff's solicitors all documents related to the purchase or lease of the BMW vehicle registered in her name.</P>
<P>67. Ms. Wei seeks this order pursuant to paragraph 8 of the May 2017 Order, which permits anyone affected by the order to apply to the Court at any time to vary it.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Ms. Lau is in Contempt of Court</UNDER></TI>
<P>68. Ms. Lau's failure to attend her scheduled examination for discovery and her noncompliance with paragraph 4 of the May 2017 Order both constitute contempt of court.</P>
<P>69. Pursuant to Rule 22-8(4) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, a person who is guilty of refusing, without lawful excuse, to attend at the time and place appointed for his or her examination for discovery is subject to the court's power to punish contempt of court.</P>
<P>70. On an application for contempt, the applicant must prove three elements, being a clear order, actual knowledge of the order, and evidence of wilful noncompliance.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Carey v. Laiken</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>30&ndash;35</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 2629</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Unifor Local Union No. VCTA v. Sunlover Holding Co.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 922</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>71. All of the elements of contempt are met in this case.</P>
<P>72. With respect to Ms. Lau's refusal to attend her scheduled examination for discovery, Ms. Wei properly served her appointment to examine Ms. Lau in accordance with the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules.</EM> Further, the correspondence between counsel reveals that Ms. Lau was aware of the appointment on September 27, 2018, as she provided information to her counsel to attempt to justify her refusal to attend. The correspondence between counsel also reveals that Ms. Lau's refusal to attend her examination was wilful and deliberate, as she provided her counsel with false information about her whereabouts and ability to attend the examination over a period of several days. Ms. Lau's failure to attend her examination was in contempt of court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Unifor Local Union No. VCTA v. Sunlover Holding Co.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 922</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>73. With respect to Ms. Lau's failure to comply with paragraph 4 of the May 2017 Order, the evidence once again establishes that all three elements of a contempt finding are present. First, the order is dear that Ms. Lau must notify the plaintiff's solicitors of the intended source of funds <UNDER>before</UNDER> spending any money on living, business or legal expenses. Second, it is clear that Ms. Lau had knowledge of the order, as Ms. Lau, through her counsel, previously provided the plaintiff's solicitors with information concerning the intended source of funds before it was spent by Ms. Lau on living expenses. Third, Ms. Lau's failure to provide the plaintiff's solicitors with the court ordered information before spending money is wilful conduct in contravention of the May 2017 Order.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 2629</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>74. The court has flexibility in crafting the appropriate remedy for contempt. Rule 22-8(1) provides that the court may impose a fine or imprisonment or both. Rule 22-8(3) provides that instead of or in addition to making an order of committal or imposing a fine, the court may order a person to give security for the person's good behaviour.</P>
<P>75. As a sanction for Ms. Lau's contempt of court, Ms. Wei seeks an order that Ms. Lau be required to post $30,000 as security for her good behaviour within two weeks of the date of the order. The $30,000 reflects the approximate amount of Ms. Wei's permitted monthly living expenses during the past ten months that she has been failing to provide the plaintiff's solicitors with the information required under the May 2017 Order.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Production of Additional Documents and Affidavit of Documents</UNDER></TI>
<P>76. Ms. Wei has demanded production of additional documents from the defendants. In particular, Ms. Wei has demanded production of all the defendants' bank and financial records from the period June 1, 2015 to present, including all bank records from the institutions listed in their Asset Lists provided on June 21, 2017.</P>
<P>77. The requested documents are capable of being used to prove or disprove material facts at issue in the proceeding. In particular, the documents are relevant to Ms. Wei's tracing claims against the defendants, and are sought from the time that Ms. Wei first advanced funds to Ms. Chiu to the present date. The documents are producible and should have been listed in the defendants' list of documents.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Han v. Cho</SOC><CITE>2008 BCSC 1207</CITE><PARANUM>6-7</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>78. Ms. Wei seeks a further order pursuant to Rule 7-1(8) that Ms. Lau (in the event that her response to civil claim is not struck) deliver an affidavit verifying her list of documents.</P>
<P>79. The court may order a party to deliver an affidavit verifying their list of documents when, in the absence of adequate explanation, relevant documents have been omitted from the list of documents. Such an order may also be made when a party has shown a dilatory and casual attitude to production of documents giving the other party reasonable cause to suspect that either deliberately or by wilful indifference relevant documents may be hidden from them.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gardner v. Viridis Energy Inc.</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 1816</CITE><PARANUM>52</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Copithorne v. Benoit</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 130</CITE><PARANUM>10&ndash;12</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>80. Where a party has, for whatever reason, omitted to list significant documents, an order for an affidavit of documents ought to be made.
<P1><EM>Copithorne</EM> at para. 11</P1></P>
<P>81. It is apparent that the defendants have failed or refused to list documents that are relevant to this proceeding. A key component of the plaintiff's claim is that the defendants received the proceeds of the fraud perpetrated on the plaintiff and converted them to their own use. The defendants' financial and banking records, including the banking records from the institutions listed in the defendants' asset lists, are clearly documents that should have been produced.</P>
<P>82. Moreover, the defendants' failure to serve a list of documents until after being ordered to do so by the court approximately ten months after the close of pleadings highlights the defendants' dilatory and casual attitude to document production.</P>
<P>83. Ms. Lau (in the event that her response to civil claim is not struck) should be ordered to swear and deliver affidavits verifying their list of documents.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>I, <BOLD>JOHN HILPERT</BOLD>, private investigator, of XXXXXXXXXX, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a private investigator retained by the plaintiff, Rong Wei, and as such have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to in this affidavit except where stated to be on information and belief and in which case I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. As I explained in my Affidavit #1 dated May 12, 2017, I was hired by Ms. Wei in November 2016 to look into the defendant Allan Chiu to verify his identity and certain claims he had made to Ms. Wei regarding his past. Ms. Wei provided me with photographs of Mr. Chiu. Ms. Wei also provided me with a copy of the defendant Mui Kwan Queenie Lau's driver's licence that had a photograph of Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>3. Using the photographs and other information I obtained concerning Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau, I was able to track their whereabouts and conduct surveillance. During my surveillance, I also observed a young woman frequently accompanying Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>4. I took several photographs of Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau in November 2016 as part of my surveillance. I also took several photographs of the young woman accompanying them. When I showed the photographs to Ms. Wei, she confirmed that the individuals in my photographs were Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau, and that the young woman was their daughter Romie.</P>
<P>5. In September 2018, I was asked to conduct further surveillance of Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau in Vancouver, British Columbia and the surrounding area. I was able to track Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau in Vancouver and the surrounding area on several days in September and October, including on September 24, 26, 27 and 28 and October 10, 2018.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>September 24, 2018</EM></TI>
<P>6. On September 24, 2018 at approximately 3: 55 p.m., I observed Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau exit from a black BMW with licence plate number XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>BMW</BOLD>&rdquo;) at the McArthurGlen outlet mall in Richmond, British Columbia. I later observed Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau returning to the BMW and driving away.

<P>14. At approximately 4: 00 p.m., Mr. Chiu entered the Point Grey Medical Clinic. I was able to do a close-up inspection of the licence plate details of the BMW and observed that the BMW was displaying an insurance tag with an expiry date of September 18, 2018.</P>
<P>15. At approximately 4:44 p.m., Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau exited the medical clinic and returned to the BMW. I then followed Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau as they drove through the UBC area before heading back to the Point Grey Medical Clinic.

<P>I, Cara Echino, Process Server of 403 - 1228 Hamilton Street, Vancouver, BC, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. On November 22, 2018, I was instructed by our client Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to begin a rush skip locate of the Defendants Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu.</P>
<P>2. I was provided with the following information:
<P1>a) Last known address of XXXXXXXXXX</P1>
<P1>b) Allan Chiu's email address is allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia</P1>
<P1>c) Telephone number for Allan Chiu is XXXXXXXXXX</P1></P>
<P>3. On November 23, 2018 at 5:07 p.m., a telephone call was made to XXXXXXXXXX. I received a message right away that said &ldquo;the customer you are calling is unavailable&rdquo;. I was unable to leave a message. An internal search was completed of the phone number and found that it is listed to &ldquo;King Ching Chan&rdquo;. A cross reference search was completed on that name, and we found no relation to Allan Chui or Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu.</P>
<P>4. On November 23, 2018 5:09 p.m., an email was sent to allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia from an email address belonging to Mainland Delivery Services, in which I advised Allan Chiu of a delivery and provided a package ID number, and the link to tracking of the &ldquo;package&rdquo;. I advised that we attempted delivery at XXXXXXXXXX but was unable to deliver. I asked for a new address for delivery but have not received a response.</P>
<P>5. All preliminary and basic online searches were completed, which include but are not limited to, searching all social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, etc.), BC OnLine name cross-referencing, myLTSA land and property records, Canada 411, and all City and utility public records. I report the following results:
<P1>a) Facebook profile found for Queenie Lau</P1>
<P1>A direct &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; message was sent to Queenie Lau at 5:52 p.m., November 22, 2018. As of 8:08 a.m. on November 23, 2018, the message showed as &ldquo;read&rdquo;, but no reply was received.</P1>
<P1>b) Various social sites for &ldquo;Allan Chiu&rdquo;, but it is unclear if it is the correct person (no picture to identify, etc)</P1>
<P1>c) Allan Richard Chiu located at XXXXXXXXXX listed as a &ldquo;Machinist&rdquo;. Unclear whether this is the correct person.</P1></P>
<P>6. We have been advised by a confidential and reliable source that a plate number check of the vehicles owned by Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu are registered to the address of XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>7. We have also been advised that Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu also sometimes goes by the name &ldquo;Suet&rdquo;. We have cross-referenced this name with all above sources and did not find any conclusive results.</P>
<P>8. At this time, we are unable to definitively locate Allan Chiu and/or Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu, but believe that documentation would come to their attention if service was effected substitutionally, by leaving the documentation on the front door of the registered residential address of the Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu, being the property located at XXXXXXXXXX</P>

<P><BOLD>Name of applicant: the Plaintiff, Rong Wei</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>To: Allan Chiu and Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwun Queenie Chiu</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>And to: Their Solicitor</BOLD></P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge or master at the courthouse at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia on 20/Dec/2018 at 9:45 am for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. A declaration that Allan Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Chiu</BOLD>&rdquo;) is in contempt of court for contravening the order of Madam Justice Humphries, made May 18, 2017 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Mareva Order</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. An order that Chiu post security with the court in the amount of $447,964.78, or such other amount as the court may direct, within seven days of the date of this order, which security is to be held pending a final resolution in this matter or a direction consented to by the parties.</P>
<P>3. The Plaintiff's costs of this application be assessed as special costs fixed at a lump sum of $7,500 payable within seven days of this order and in any event of the cause by the Chiu.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Introduction</EM></TI>
<P>4. The Plaintiff applies for an order that Chiu is in contempt of court for breaching the order of Madam Justice Humphries pronounced on May 18, 2017 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Mareva Order</BOLD>&rdquo;). In short, based on records received through enforcement proceedings taken in Hong Kong in respect of the Mareva Order, the Plaintiff has learned that Chiu, since the date of the Mareva Order, has withdrawn a total of $447,964.78 from his personal account in Hong Kong. As a sanction for this contempt, the Plaintiff seeks an order requiring that Chiu give security in the amount improperly withdrawn.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Underlying Claim</EM></TI>
<P>5. The substance of the Plaintiff's claim against the Defendants is summarized in the Plaintiffs first affidavit, which was relied on in obtaining the Mareva Order:
<P1>(a) the Plaintiff provided over USD $1.1 million to the Defendants, Chiu and his wife Queenie Lau, for them to make certain investments on the Plaintiff's behalf (paragraph 64);</P1>
<P1>(b) the Defendants induced the Plaintiff to provide these funds based on representations that, among other things, these funds would be used by Chiu to purchase shares for the Plaintiff, Chiu had considerable experience in investing as a result of a high level position with Goldman Sachs, and Chiu owned properties around the world (paragraphs 64, 66 and 5);</P1>
<P1>(c) the Plaintiff understood that any shares purchased using the funds she provided to the Defendants would be held on her behalf and in trust for her (paragraph 65);</P1>
<P1>(d) the Plaintiff subsequently learned, through investigative efforts, that the representations made to her by the Defendants were false (paragraphs 90 to 93); and</P1>
<P1>(e) despite repeated demands, with the exceptions of USD $34,000, the Defendants have failed to return to the Plaintiff the funds she provided to them (paragraphs 70 to 78).</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Mareva Order</EM></TI>
<P>6. On May 18, 2017, the Plaintiff obtained the Mareva Order, the terms of which, among other things, provided that:
<P1>(a) the Defendants not in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned (paragraph 1(b)); and</P1>
<P1>(b) the Defendants provide the Plaintiff's solicitor with a list (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Defendants' Asset Lists</BOLD>&rdquo;) verified by affidavit setting out all of their assets as of the date of the Mareva Order (paragraph 17).</P1></P>
<P>7. The Mareva Order was emailed to each of the Defendants on May 19, 2017.</P>
<P>8. On May 20, 2017 Chiu messaged Eliza Wei the following:
<QUOTE><P>Hi Eliza, I just opened that email yesterday... I hope you could withdraw the freezing order from the court. If the freezing order continues being in effect, my account is frozen, my families and friends couldn't lend me money to pay back to you, nor could I transfer the money to you ...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. On May 25, 2017, Plaintiff's counsel was first contacted by Mr. Riley, the Defendants' former counsel, who advised that he was in the process of being retained by the Defendants.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Defendants' Asset Lists</EM></TI>
<P>10. On or around June 21, 2017, the Defendants, through counsel, provided the Defendants' Asset Lists to Plaintiff's counsel.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Hong Kong Order</EM></TI>
<P>11. On August 18, 2017, further to efforts to have the Mareva Order recognized and enforced in Hong Kong, the Plaintiff obtained an <EM>ex parte</EM> injunction and preservation order and <EM>ex parte</EM> disclosure order (the &ldquo;<EM>Hong Kong Order</EM>&rdquo;), which provided, among other things, that the Mareva Order be enforced in Hong Kong and the Defendants not remove, dispose of or deal with their assets. The Hong Kong Order further provided that Bank of China and Standard Chartered produce records in respect of the Defendants' accounts, including Chiu's account at Bank of China in Hong Kong (the &ldquo;<BOLD>BOC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Hong Kong Banking Records</EM></TI>
<P>12. The Plaintiff's Hong Kong solicitors subsequently received banking records from Bank of China and Standard Chartered in respect of the accounts maintained by the Defendants. The records indicate that from May 20, 2017 onward Chiu withdrew the following amounts from the BOC Account: $1,663,221.18 in HKD, $2900.00 in CAD, and $123,545.73 in USD, for a total amount of CAD $447,964.78 based on the Bank of Canada foreign exchange rate posted on December 4, 2018.</P>
<P>13. With the exception of $10,500 (Canadian) withdrawn by Chiu from the BOC Account, these withdrawals are in addition to, and not explained by, the exemptions allowed for the legal retainers and monthly personal expenses of the Defendants under the Mareva Order.</P>
<P>14. By letter dated September 15, 2017 counsel for the Plaintiff requested an explanation of the foregoing transactions in light of the Mareva Order and the Defendants' Asset Lists.</P>
<P>15. To date an explanation has not been provided by the Defendants.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>16. On an application for a finding of civil contempt of a court order, the applicant must prove three elements:
<P1>(a) the existence of the court order;</P1>
<P1>(b) the alleged contemnor knew of the order and its terms; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the alleged contemnor intentionally disobeyed one or more terms of the order.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Yeap Soon Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The applicant bears the onus of proving the elements of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.
<P1><BOLD><EM>CE International Resources</EM> at para. 24.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. The last element of contempt requires proof of deliberate conduct that has the effect of contravening the court order, but it is not necessary for the applicant to prove an intent to bring the court into disrepute or to interfere with the lawful process of the court.
<P1><BOLD><EM>CE International Resources</EM> at para. 25.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>North Vancouver (District) v. Sorrenti</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 316</CITE><PARANUM>11 and 14</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Further, intention may be inferred from the circumstances.
<P1><BOLD><EM>North Vancouver (District)</EM> at paras. 13-14.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>CE International Resources</EM> at para. 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The evidence in this case establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Chiu knew of the Mareva Order and intentionally disobeyed its terms.</P>
<P>21. The Plaintiff's application for the Mareva Order was served on each of the Defendants on May 16, 2017, pursuant to the short leave and alternative service orders of Master Scarth, and the order itself was emailed to each of them on May 19, 2017. Chiu acknowledged both receiving the Mareva Order and that it operated to freeze his accounts, on May 20, 2017 (in Hong Kong). The Mareva Order was clearly brought to the attention of, and its significance appreciated by, Chiu as of May 20, 2017.</P>
<P>22. The banking records disclosed pursuant to the Hong Kong Order make clear that Chiu intentionally disobeyed the Mareva Order in withdrawing funds from the BOC Account.</P>
<P>23. As a result, Chiu should be found in contempt of court for his breach of the Mareva Order.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Appropriate Sanction for Contempt of Court</EM></TI>
<P>24. Upon finding a party in contempt of a court order, the court has the power to impose a fine; make an order of committal; or order that the party guilty of contempt give security for the person's good behaviour.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, R. 22-8(1) and (3).</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 2629</CITE><PARANUM>22&ndash;24</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. In determining the punishment for contempt, the court will consider the following factors, among others:
<P1>(a) the need to deter the contemnor;</P1>
<P1>(b) the successful party's ability to realize the judgment; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the extent to which the breach was intended.</P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>CE International</EM> Resources at para. 44.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. The Plaintiff submits that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be appropriate for the court to grant an order requiring that Chiu post as security with the court the amounts withdrawn by him in breach of the Mareva Order, and that such security be paid within seven days. Such an order would ensure that Chiu does not benefit from his contempt, and therefore act as a deterrent, serve as a proportional sanction given the nature of the breaches and provide a measure of protection to the Plaintiff and her ability to recover on an eventual judgment.</P>
<P>27. Deterrence is a particularly important factor in determining the appropriate sanction for Chiu's contempt, as Chiu has shown a continua! disregard for the court process throughout this proceeding. Most recently, Chiu swore an affidavit admitting that he lied to his former counsel, Kieran Siddall, that his wife was in China and unable to attend her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27, 2018. Ms. Lau was not in fact in China, but was in Vancouver, where both she and Chiu were observed by a private investigator in the days leading up to Ms. Lau's examination for discovery, as well as on the scheduled date itself. Chiu subsequently lied to his counsel that he was also in China and no longer resided in Vancouver.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Costs</UNDER></TI>
<P>28. A person found in contempt of court is normally ordered to pay special costs, because a breach of a court order is <EM>prima facie</EM> conduct deserving of rebuke. Moreover, a person who obtains a court order is entitled to have that order complied with. Special costs operate as an indemnity to the party forced to bring an application to remedy the other party's contempt.
<P1><BOLD><EM>CE International Resources</EM> at para. 50; and</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>North Vancouver (District)</EM> at para. 20.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. The Plaintiff respectfully submits that it would be appropriate in this case for the court to award special costs to the Plaintiff, payable forthwith and in any event of the cause assessed at $7,500.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>I, <BOLD>RONG (ELIZA) WEI</BOLD>, of Vancouver, British Columbia, housewife, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the plaintiff in this action and as such have personal knowledge of matters hereinafter referred to save and except where stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated, I verily believe same to be true.</P>
<P>2. On May 16, 2017, I sent WeChat messages to the Defendant Allan Chiu at 17:32 PST and the Defendant Queenie Lau at 17:33 PST. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> are screen shots of the messages sent to both Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>3. On May 20, 2017, I received a WeChat message from Mr. Chiu at 19:05 PST. A copy of this message is attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>4. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a translation of the WeChat message prepared by Mosaic Translation Services.</P>
<P>5. From my conversation with Allan Chiu, it is clear that he understands spoken and written English. He almost always spoke to me in English and would often write to me in English and explain to me what documents written in English actually stated. Sometimes if I did not understand the exact meaning of English words, he wrote down the Chinese meaning in Chinese.</P>

<P>24. Allan Chiu's transactional history and his actions demonstrate that he was unaware that the Mareva Order extended to the accounts in Hong Kong and that the purported breach, if it occurred, was not intentional. After first receiving legal advice, the banking transactions completed by Allan Chiu nearly ceased and subsequent withdrawals were to satisfy living expenses are summarized as follows:
<P1>(a) With respect to the Hong Kong Dollar Account, on June 9, 2017 at 3:34pm HKT, Allan Chiu made a single deposit of HKD$155,686.00. He subsequently withdrew $20,000HKD for living expenses. Each of the transactions subsequent to June 9, 2017 was for the purpose of ordinary expenses while residing in Hong Kong, with the exception of nominal withdrawals believed to be bank fees, and were reported to plaintiff counsel as confirmed in affidavit #3 of Tina Le dated December 5, 2018.</P1>
<P1>(b) With respect to the Canadian Dollar Account, on July 12, 2017 atl2:50, HKT, Allan Chiu deposited CAD$2,900 into his account for the sole purpose of transferring a rent payment to Canada. The funds were taken from the account on July 12, 2017 at 6:20pm HKT and were reported to the Plaintiff as confirmed in affidavit #3 of Tina Le dated December 5, 2018 as ordinary living expenses.</P1>
<P1>(c) On August 4, 2017 at 9:12am HKT, Allan Chiu withdrew HKD$21,088.08 for the purpose of a rent payment to Canada.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Allan Chiu at para. 13</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. The Defendants accept and adopt the test as described by the plaintiffs at paragrap hs 16-17 of the Notice of Application.</P>
<P>2. Allan Chiu does not deny the existence of the court order. That said, the applicant has failed to prove that Allan Chiu intentionally disobeyed one or more terms of the order.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Absence of intention to disobey one or more terms of the order</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>3. The three part test is conjunctive and necessitates the applicant satisfy all three elements. At issue here is the third element. The applicant has not proven that the &ldquo;... alleged contemnor intentionally disobeyed one or more of the terms of the order.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>4. The third element of the test requires &ldquo;... proof of deliberate conduct that has the effect of contravening the court order.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>5. In assessing what is necessary for civil contempt, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has stated:
<QUOTE><P>... the conduct constituting disobedience of the court order must have been intentional, as opposed to accidental or unintentional, and with the fact that intention <EM>may</EM> be inferred from the circumstances... &lsquo;all that is necessary is proof of deliberate conduct that has the effect of contravening the order; an intent to bring the Court into disrepute or to interfere with the due course of justice or with the lawful process of the Court is not an essential element of civil contempt.&rsquo; (emphasis in the original)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>North Vancouver (District) v. Sorrenti</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 314</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF>., citing <CASEREF><SOC>Topgrow Greeenhouses Ltd. v. Houweling</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 355</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>6. Justice Fisher in <EM>CE International Resources</EM> stated that positive proof that disobedience was accidental or unintentional results in an unlikely conviction of contempt as stated::
<QUOTE><P>... the petitioner must show both conduct which was in breach of an order and that the conduct was intentional&mdash;although as has been seen, intention may be inferred from the circumstances of a given case. If the circumstances support such an inference, then in practical terms, the defendant is likely to be convicted in the absence of positive proof that his or her disobedience of the order was in fact accidental or unintentional.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>7. Deliberate as an adjective is defined as &ldquo;[i]ntentional; premeditated; fully considered.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM> (10th ed. 2014)</P1></P>
<P>8. Intentional as an adjective is defined as: &ldquo;[d]one with the aim of carrying out the act.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM> (10th ed. 2014)</P1></P>
<P>9. In response to paragraph 22 of the Notice of Application, Mr. Chiu did not &ldquo;intentionally disobey&rdquo; the Mareva Order as declared by the plaintiff. Rather, in the span of four days between May 17, 2017 at 8:15am and May 20, 2017 at 6:04 am, he received a number of legal documents while in Hong Kong. Mr. Chiu did not recognize the sender and it wasn't until the second e-mail that he determined he required legal counsel. He attempted to retain counsel but, as it was the weekend, was unable to do so and did not receive legal advice until May 25, 2017 at approximately 6am HKT.</P>
<P>10. Intentional and deliberate acts necessitate premeditation and being fully considered. Mr. Chiu could not consider his actions.</P>
<P>11. Further, Mr. Chiu's actions and an assessment of the facts demonstrate that Mr. Chiu did not intentionally or deliberately dispose of assets as:
<P1>(a) the process of transferring funds from the CIBC account to Hong Kong was initiated well in advance of any notice of the impending lawsuit brought by the plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>(b) the actions of Mr. Chiu were a response to funds being deposited by his wife in the midst of marital strife and not related to disposing assets from British Columbia;</P1>
<P1>(c) specifically, the actions of Mr. Chiu were a response to threats to his and his families personal well-being as a result of gambling debts amassed in the year prior May 2017;</P1>
<P1>(d) Mr. Chiu clearly did not understand the terms of the order, which is evidenced by his e-mail to his counsel in which he advised that a &ldquo;response deadline&rdquo; of the court order existed 7 days after the Order was granted, or May 25, 2018. The Order does not contain a response deadline of 7 days. Rather, at paragraph 17 of the Order, the defendants are ordered to produce an asset list within 7 days. There is no other reference to a 7 day response in the Mareva Order and, as is clear at paragraph 8, anyone can apply to vary or discharge the order;</P1>
<P1>(e) The foregoing absence of intention is confirmed by the actions of Mr. Chiu after June 9, 2017 when funds were deposited into his accounts in Hong Kong. It belies logic for an individual who it is argued had the intention to dispose of funds to deposit funds into an account that was subject to a Mareva Order; and</P1>
<P1>(f) this is especially true as, following discussion with legal counsel, the withdrawals from the account were made for the purposes of adhering to the Mareva Order with respect to living expenses.</P1></P>
<P>12. Further, and in any event, the Defendant had not received notice of the order.</P>
<P>13. With respect to paragraph 27 of the Notice of Application, the defendant denies that this is a circumstance where there has been continual disregard for the court process. In reference to the lie made by Allan Chiu to former counsel, Mr. Chiu clarified and confirmed on cross-examination on the affidavits, that he was concerned for his wife's well-being. His wife's brother had been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, had a mother with failing health, and was dealing with her own health issues. He lied to shield his wife from the perceived stresses of an Examination for Discovery with good intentions and not continual disregard.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the wife of the Co-Defendant Allan Chiu and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I was never personally advised of the scheduled examination for discovery scheduled in Vancouver for September 27, 2018. As such, I was unaware of any expectation or obligation to attend the scheduled examination for discovery.</P>
<P>3. In or about August 2018, my biological brother Kwan Ying Lau, advised me that he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. My brother is presently receiving treatment in the People's Republic of China (&ldquo;<BOLD>China</BOLD>&rdquo;) where he receives treatment for his diagnosis of cancer. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a true copy of a report provided to me by my brother dated September 21, 2018. The report has been redacted to remove symptomology that is private but contains a summary of the diagnosis, in Chinese and in English, and which specifically reads that he has an invasive carcinoma of the left lobe of his lung. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a photograph of prescription drugs provided to my brother Kwan Ying Lau for Tagrisso. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a true copy of summary of a summary of the drug Tagrisso published by drugs.com which was sourced from the internet on December 4, 2018 at https://www.drugs.com/tagrisso.html.</P>
<P>4. In or about January, 2018, my biological mother, advised me that she was diagnosed with gall bladder problems which required frequent hospital visits, including hospitalization in or about February, 2018 for approximately 4 weeks, during which she required surgery to places tents in her bile duct. My mother's health continues to deteriorate. In or about July, 2018, we were advised that she required another surgery.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Allan Chiu, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700 - 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have been primarily responsible for communicating with legal counsel regarding issues related to this file. I recall being advised that an Examination for Discovery was scheduled for September 27, 2018 for my wife, Ms. Lau, to attend.</P>
<P>3. I was advised, and verily believe it to be true, that my wife's biological brother, Kwan Ying Lau, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.</P>
<P>4. I was advised, and verily believe it to be true, that my wife's biological mother was diagnosed with gall bladder problems which required frequent hospital visits, including hospitalization in or about February, 2018 for approximately 4 weeks, which required surgery to place stents in her bile duct. My mother in law's health continues to deteriorate. We were advised in or about July 2018 that she required another surgery. On or about October 25, 2018, her mother underwent another operation to remove stents and remove her gall bladder.</P>
<P>5. I was advised, and verily believe it to be true, that my wife was diagnosed with Thalessimia and a serious anemic condition which has worsened over the last 18 months.</P>
<P>6. In or about August, 2018 when I was first advised of the scheduled Examination for Discovery of my wife, I observed that my wife was under tremendous stress related to her own health and related to the health of her family members. I observed a loss of appetite, rapid loss of weight, memory loss and lapses, and sleep loss. I was concerned for her own well -being and her mental state.</P>
<P>7. As a result of those observations, I decided not to inform my wife of the scheduled Examination for Discovery of September 27, 2018. I also decided to misinform our previous counsel, Kieran Siddall, that my wife and I were in China and unable to travel for medical reasons related to her blood disorder. I also misinformed our previous co unsel that both my wife and I would be unavailable to attend an Examination for Discovery until December.</P>
<P>8. I am aware that my decision not to inform my wife of the Examination for Discovery scheduled September 27, 2018 and to misinform my counsel that we were in China was foolish. However, I made the decision not to advise her of the obligation with the best intentions of assisting my wife through a difficult period.</P>
<P>9. I am able to attend an Examination for Discovery between the dates of December 18, 2018 to December 20, 2018 and will attend whether ordered, or in response to an Appointment to Examine for Discovery.</P>
<P>10. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action regarding orders for contempt of court, to strike out my Response to Civil Claim, to attend discovery, provide document disclosure, and related orders pertaining to costs.</P>

<P>11. In response to paragraphs 20 through 24 of the Hilpert Affidavit, my only connection to an Alberta company operating under the name, &ldquo;Stoneset Equities&rdquo;, was that my Singapore company assisted the Alberta company, for a fee, to organize seminars at various locations in Asia.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT #1 OF RONG (ELIZA) WEI</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. I have read the Affidavit #1 of the Plaintiff sworn herein May 12, 2017 (the &ldquo;Wei #1 Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>22. In response to the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff has a residential address at XXXXXXXXXX well as a residential address at Yi Yuan Ju Xiao Qu, XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>23. In further response to the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff is a citizen of both Canada and the Peoples' Republic of China.</P>
<P>24. In response to paragraph 3 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I first met the Plaintiff at the River Club in Richmond, BC in early 2015.</P>
<P>25. In response to paragraph 4 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, almost from my first conversation with the Plaintiff in 2015 while watching our respective children play te nnis at the River Club, the Plaintiff would complain to me about her stock brokers at various banks losing money for her. Mrs. Chiu was not often at the River Club and, when she was, she showed no interest in discussing stocks so Ms. Wei only complained and talked to me about her investments. In those early days of my relationship with the Plaintiff, I sometimes listened to her out of politeness but I was mostly busy tending to my child at the River Club.</P>
<P>26. In response to paragraph 5 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff's statement is false. Having only just met the Plaintiff, I had no reason or wish to disclose details of my education and business background. I did tell the Plaintiff that I was retired for health reasons.</P>
<P>27. In further response to paragraph 5 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I never told the Plaintiff any of the things listed in sub-paragraphs 5(a) through 5(e) and none of those things is true.</P>
<P>28. In response to paragraph 6 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, from almost my first meeting with the Plaintiff, she seemed obsessed with the stock investments she had with her banks at the time and she complained constantly about her stock brokers not doing a good job and losing her money.</P>
<P>29. In farther response to paragraph 6 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in our first few months of our knowing one other, Ms. Wei would take every opportunity when we met at the River Club to complain about her investments and to ask me questions and to seek recommendations on stocks. From time to time I would give her some recommendations about stocks in which I was investing or which I thought might be good investments. Later, the Plaintiff would tell me that those recommendations were good ones and that I must be an expert in stock trading. She often asked me if I could help her trade stocks. I told her that I could not do so because I was not a professional money manager and that she should stick with her brokers. This refusal on my part to assist the Plaintiff lasted from January 2015 to in or about May 2015.</P>
<P>30. In response to paragraph 7 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, after months of repeated requests from the Plaintiff, I finally agreed to help her with her trading accounts as a friend only and not as a money manager and the Plaintiff agreed to proceed on that basis. As a result, in June 2015, the Plaintiff first gave me the password for her Essence International Hong Kong trading account (the &ldquo;Hong Kong Portfolio&rdquo;) which the Plaintiff had opened under the name of the Plaintiff's mother, Wang Xian, which the Plaintiff informed me had been done for tax avoidance purposes. Due to the size of the Hong Kong Portfolio and the amount of work which I anticipated would be required to turn that account into a better performing one, the Plaintiff agreed to pay me an incentive of USD$10,000/year plus a performance bonus.</P>
<P>31. In further response to paragraph 7 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in June 2015, the Hong Kong Portfolio started with a balance of approximately HKD$17.8 million (approximate value USD$2.3 million). However, that Hong Kong Portfolio was starting to suffer heavy losses, and by late-August, the account saw losses of around HKD$8 million (Approximate value USD$1.1 Million) from stock positions that were purchased by the Plaintiff before I took over the day to day trading of the account. I have helped the Plaintiff trade in the Hong Kong Portfolio from June 2015 up to and including April 2017. In 2016 alone, I helped the Plaintiff earn approximately USD$313,577 in profits in her Hong Kong Portfolio.</P>
<P>32. The Hong Kong Portfolio was exclusively limited to trading Hong Kong and US Stocks in self-directed trading accounts.</P>
<P>33. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit are copies of WeChat text messages between me and the Plaintiff regarding trading in the Hong Kong Portfolio and the photograph sent in the WeChat text that contains the spreadsheet related to the Hong Kong Portfolio.</P>
<P>34. In response to paragraph 8 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in August 2015, the Plaintiff gave me the password to her CIBC Investors' Edge trading account (the &ldquo;US Portfolio&rdquo;) so that I could carry out daily trades in that account on her behalf. In August 2015, the US Portfolio had a balance of approximately USD$200,000. Due to the relatively small size of the US Portfolio, it was agreed between me and the Plaintiff that she would pay me an incentive of USD$5,000/year plus a performance bonus.</P>
<P>35. The US Portfolio involved trading stocks in the trading account. The transactions in the US Portfolio was limited exclusively to stock trading on the CIBC Investors' Edge trading account and the limited offerings contained within CIBC Investors' Edge. Management of the US Portfolio on the CIBC Investors' Edge excluded initial public offerings.</P>
<P>36. In response to paragraph 9 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in early 2015 that she was extremely unhappy with her account manager at CIBC Wood Gundy. She claimed her Wood Gundy broker was misleading her on her returns. By May 2015, she told me that she had sold her entire Canadian stock portfolio and transferred the sale proceeds funds to the Hong Kong Portfolio with Essence International in Hong Kong to purchase Hong Kong stocks. At the same time in May 2015, the Plaintiff was asking for my advice for her remaining US stocks that she had managed by CIBC Wood Gundy, She complained to me that the returns she was earning on those US stocks were not good and growth in them was very slow. In response, I suggested that she buy some US initial public offerings (&ldquo;IPOs&rdquo;) instead because it was my experience that such IPOs could often yield very impressive returns in a short period of time.</P>
<P>37. In response to paragraph 10 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. At that time, in early 2015, I did not know the Plaintiff well and did not disclose to her any details of my personal financial situation. I simply suggested to the Plaintiff that she speak to her advisors at CIBC Wood Gundy regarding any good upcoming US company IPOs that they could recommend. Further, I did not tell the Plaintiff that I had a retirement account or any account with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>38. In response to paragraph 11 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not have an account with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong and I did not tell the Plaintiff that I had such an account.</P>
<P>39. In response to paragraph 12 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. The funds deposited by the plaintiff into Mrs. Chiu's account were loans made to me by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>40. In response to paragraph 13 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I never held shares or other investments for the plaintiff.</P>
<P>41. In response to paragraph 14 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in June 2015, when the Plaintiff was again complaining to me about the poor returns she felt she was earning on her investments managed by CIBC Wood Gundy, she asked me for investment ideas that might yield a good return. I told her that I thought that there were a few good companies going public at that time, and that she should get some of the related IPO shares from her broker at CIBC Wood Gundy.</P>
<P>42. In response to paragraph 15 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I told the plaintiff I would buy some IPOs myself if I had the funds. The plaintiff told me she could lend me some money because at the time the plaintiff was trying to convince me to help her manage her trading accounts and that was her way to persuade and enticed me to help her. The plaintiff agreed to lend me USD$200,000.</P>
<P>43. In response to paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff deposited the funds into Mrs. Chiu's CIBC account.</P>
<P>44. In response to paragraph 17 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, Mrs. Chiu accepted the USD$200,000 on my behalf. Mrs. Chiu had no knowledge about the purpose of funds.</P>
<P>45. In response to paragraph 18 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I never told the plaintiff I purchased any shares of the Trans Union IPO for her.</P>
<P>46. In response to paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not purchase any shares in Trans Union for the Plaintiff and I did not tell the Plaintiff that I had purchased such shares. Most of my conversations with the Plaintiff in late June 2015 revolved around the Hong Kong Portfolio, the fact that she was happy that I was now helping her with that portfolio, and discussing how the Plaintiff, with my input, was going to turn that portfolio around.</P>
<P>47. In response to paragraph 21 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. It was I who suggested to the Plaintiff that, although we were friends, we should still have written agreements to outline the compensation she had agreed to pay me for helping her manage the Hong Kong Portfolio and the US Portfolio. I recommended a separate agreement for each portfolio.</P>
<P>48. In response to paragraph 22a of the Wei #1 Affidavit, Exhibit D to that affidavit is a copy of an agreement regarding my helping the Plaintiff with the daily stock trading in the Hong Kong Portfolio with Essence International, which, at that time in July 2015, had a balance of around HKD$17.8 million (approx. USD$2.3 million).</P>
<P>49. Due to the size of the Hong Kong Portfolio and the work involved to turn that underperforming portfolio around, the annual management fee was agreed between me and the Plaintiff at USD$ 10,000 plus bonus. This agreement was signed on July 4, 2015 but I had started helping the Plaintiff manage that portfolio earlier in June 2015 and the Plaintiff did not pay me anything under that agreement until December 8, 2015.</P>
<P>50. In response to paragraph 22b of the Wei #1 Affidavit, Exhibit E to that affidavit is a copy of an agreement regarding my helping the Plaintiff with the daily stock trading in her CIBC Investors' Edge account (US Portfolio) which, at that time in July 2015, had a balance of around USD$200,000. Due to the relatively small size of the US Portfolio, it was agreed between me and the Plaintiff that the annual management fee would be only CAD$5,000 plus bonus.</P>
<P>51. With respect to Exhibit E and D to the Wei #1 Affidavit, and contrary to the Plaintiff's statement, these agreements had nothing to do with the purchase of any shares through a Goldman Sachs account. Further, the plaintiff suggested that these agreements be signed by Mrs. Chiu because, as the Plaintiff was aware, the management fees would be deposited into Mrs. Chiu's account. The Plaintiff suggested it was appropriate that the signatory on the agreement was the actual named account holder of the bank account that was to receive the management fees.</P>
<P>52. In response to paragraph 23 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, neither I nor Mrs. Chiu is a licensed or certified money manager in Canada or elsewhere. Mrs. Chiu sign ed the agreements (Exhibits D and E to the Wei #1 Affidavit) when the Plaintiff paid the management fee to Mrs. Chiu.</P>
<P>53. In further response to paragraph 23 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff knew at all times that neither I nor Mrs. Chiu was a professional money manager but she still wanted me, as a friend, to help her manage her investments and, to that end, she supplied me passwords to her trading accounts and gave me explicit permission to make trades on her behalf in the Essence International Trading account (&ldquo;Hong Kong Portfolio&rdquo;) and the CIBC Investors Edge Trading account (&ldquo;US Portfolio&rdquo;).</P>
<P>54. In further response to paragraph 23 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me and I agreed that the written agreements were to give me comfort so that I would be guaranteed compensation to manage the Plaintiff's accounts. The agreements were not intended to be legally binding and that she could not hold me or Mrs. Chiu responsible if her investments did not perform well.</P>
<P>55. In response to paragraph 24 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, on July 4, 2015, at the Plaintiff's invitation, Mrs. Chiu visited the Plaintiff at her house in Vancouver because the Plaintiff was leaving for China the next day and she needed help for some travel arrangements to Seattle such that the Plaintiff could board her flight to China. The Plaintiff was planning to be away from Vancouver for the summer and she wanted to pay me before she left to China for helping her with the Hong Kong Portfolio. At that meeting, the Plaintiff paid to Mrs. Chiu USD$3,670(equivalent to CAD$5,000) for the management fee for the US Portfolio and she told Mrs. Chiu she would pay the USD$ 10,000 management fee for the Hong Kong Portfolio at a later date.</P>
<P>56. In further response to paragraph 24 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, it was at the meeting on July 4, 2015 that Mrs. Chiu signed the two agreements (Exhibits D and E to the Wei #1 Affidavit). Mrs. Chiu advised me and I verily believe it to be true that at that meeting, the Plaintiff and Mrs. Chiu joked that, in the Chinese culture, it is sometimes said that the husband does the work but the wife receives the payment.</P>
<P>57. In response to paragraph 25 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff was obsessed with making a good return on her investments, so our discussions were often about different investment ideas and opportunities. We spoke often about various companies going public but I did not agree to purchase Ferrari NV shares in the Plaintiff's name or at all.</P>
<P>58. In response to paragraph 26 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not advise the Plaintiff that I would sell Trans Union shares for her and I did not hold any such shares for the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>59. In response to paragraphs 27 - 28 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in October 2015 that she had some funds that she would like me to hold for her to be used to purchase a good investment if one arose, she also indicated she wanted to divert her funds and did not want to have too much cash in her accounts for tax reasons. The plaintiff told me she would deposit the funds into Mrs. Chiu's CIBC account for that purpose. There was no agreement between me and the Plaintiff or direction from the Plaintiff that those funds were to be used to purchase Ferrari NV shares or any other specific shares or investment. I learned later that the Plaintiff had deposited approximately USD$55,000 to Mrs. Chiu's CIBC account.</P>
<P>60. In response to paragraph 30 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not provide to the Plaintiff the summary which forms the first p age (page 16) of Exhibit H to the Wei #1 Affidavit. I had not seen this document prior to reading the Wei #1 Affidavit, although I have seen screenshots for the US Portfolio similar to the second and third pages (pages 17 and 18) of Exhibit H to the We i #1 Affidavit.</P>
<P>61. In response to paragraph 31 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not provide to the Plaintiff the summary which forms Exhibit I to the Wei #1 Affidavit. I had not seen this document prior to reading the W ei #1 Affidavit.</P>
<P>62. In response to paragraph 32 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I had no such conversation with the Plaintiff and did not provide her any such advice.</P>
<P>63. In response to paragraph 33 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, neither I nor Mrs. Chiu received USD$7,000 or any other amount from the Plaintiff on or about October 21, 2015 and, further, I had no agreement with or direction from the Plaintiff to purchase shares in Ferrari NV.</P>
<P>64. In response to paragraph 34 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, on December 8, 2015, the Plaintiff deposited USD$10,000 into Mrs. Chiu's CIBC account. This was the sum which the Plaintiff wanted to pay me to help her manage the Hong Kong Portfolio as stated in paragraph 53 above and in Exhibit D (page 8) of the Wei #1 Affidavit.</P>
<P>65. In response to paragraph 35 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the only management fees paid by the Plaintiff in this matter were paid to me. Only I, and not Mrs. Chiu, provided the Plaintiff any assistance in managing her investments. The Plaintiff agreed to pay me USDS 10,000 to manage the Hong Kong Portfolio. Further, the Plaintiff agreed to pay me CAD$5,000 to manage the US Portfolio and that sum was paid on July 4, 2015.</P>
<P>66. In response to paragraph 36 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not provide to the Plaintiff the summary which forms the first page (page 24) of Exhibit K to the Wei #1 Affidavit. I had not seen this document prior to reading the Wei #1 Affidavit, although I have seen screenshots for the US Portfolio similar to the second page (page 25) of Exhibit H to the Wei #1 Affidavit and I did show the Plaintiff similar screenshots showing some trading profits in December 2015.</P>
<P>67. In response to paragraph 37 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, The Plaintiff and I h ad become very close by late 2015 and, at her request, I had become more and more involved in helping her with many important decisions in her life. At that time, the Plaintiff was going through a difficult and complicated divorce proceeding and disput ing finances with her husband. The Plaintiff made it very clear to me that she wanted to reorganize her own finances and that she wanted me to help her do so.</P>
<P>68. In further response to paragraph 37 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in mid-December 2015 that she wished to sell her US rental properties in and around Las Vegas because she felt that her real estate agent, Frances Cox, who had been managing the rentals of those houses for her in the past few years had been overcharging her on management fees and maintenance costs for those properties.</P>
<P>69. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of an email stream between myself, the Plaintiff and Frances Cox regarding the Plaintiff's Las Vegas properties beginning on December 31, 2015.</P>
<P>70. In further response to paragraph 37 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me that she wished to sell the Las Vegas houses with a view to raising around USD$1.0 million to be used for investments opportunities that would yield a better return.</P>
<P>71. In further response to paragraph 37 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, there were rumours in and around December 2015 that Airbnb, a well-known US technology company, would be going public, so there were discussions between me and the Plaintiff about potentially buying some shares in Airbnb with the sales proceeds from her Las Vegas houses. The Plaintiff did not give me funds nor directions to purchase shares in Airbnb for her.</P>
<P>72. In response to paragraphs 38&ndash;40 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in and around December 2015, the Plaintiff was struggling with her then husband regarding her divorce settlement and the Plaintiff was extremely stressed about her financial situation. The Plaintiff told me at that time that she still wanted to explore different investment ideas that would yield a good return. I told the Plaintiff, at that time, that there was no need to rush into any investments, but she told me she had some money coming to her and she would rather not have too much money in her own accounts. As such, she instructed me that she would deposit some money into Mrs. Chiu's account for me to hold for her,</P>
<P>73. In further response to paragraph 39 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff deposited funds into Mrs. Chiu's account but did not specify any purpose or use for the funds. It was unclear to me the source of the funds. The plaintiff told me most of her funds are transferred from China to Canada using illegal underground banks to avoid capital outflow restrictions by the Chinese Government and also to escape the attentio n the CRA in Canada.</P>
<P>74. In response to paragraph 41 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff asked me to draft the unsigned agreement which forms Exhibit M to the Wei #1 Affidavit because she wanted to provide me additional funds in trust to hold until we could determine the US equities that she wanted to purchase. The Plaintiff later changed her mind and did not sign the agreement or provide me the funds referred to in the draft agreement.</P>
<P>75. In response to paragraph 42 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have used the email address, <UNDER>allan@allanchiuconsultina.asia</UNDER>, since my first correspondence with the Plaintiff. I told the Plaintiff and she knew well that I was retired and not running any businesses.</P>
<P>76. In response to paragraph 43 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I never agreed to purchase Airbnb shares for the Plaintiff. Contrary to the rumours described above, Airbnb did not make a public share offering. When the Plaintiff gave me money, her intention was for me to hold the funds for her until she could decide where and what to invest in. I verily believe the main reason she wanted me to hold funds for her was to avoid drawing too much attention from the tax authorities. Our discussions about the funds were often not specific about where and in what she we would like to invest. The Plaintiff also had a tendency to change her mind often about investing in different things. She would sometimes tell me that she wanted to invest in certain stocks, only to change her mind the next day and then tell me to switch my focus to property markets elsewhere. At one time in 2016, the Plaintiff even explored the idea of investing in Picasso Paintings and in French Vineyards.</P>
<P>77. In further response to paragraph 43 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, due to the intimate relationship between me and the Plaintiff at the time, money matters became quite blurry as the Plaintiff felt that we were together as a couple, even financially. I felt the same way and often blended our resources, paying for our travels, meals, entertainment expenses, and even some fees for the Plaintiff's BVI company registration and related administrative costs. The Plaintiff told me I could use the funds that I was holding for her as I saw fit, either using the funds personally for my own use or using the funds for things such as expenses in our travelling, entertainment, meals etc.</P>
<P>78. In response to paragraph 44 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff never asked me to return the USD$64,000. She asked me to hold that money for future investments. In her email dated Jan 24, 2016 (Wei #1 Affidavit, Exhibit N, written in Chinese), she told me that she trusted me and wanted me to continue managing her trading accounts.</P>
<P>79. In response to paragraphs 44 - 45 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in early January 2016, I travelled to Europe with my wife and daughter. As my intimate relationship with the Plaintiff had only recently commenced, the Plaintiff was unhappy about it and insecure in both our personal relationship and the funds that I was holding for her. However, when I returned to Vancouver in late January 2016, the Plaintiff and I took up our relationship and became even closer and more involved in each other's daily lives.</P>
<P>80. In response to paragraph 46 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. Mrs. Chiu was not present during any of the meetings between me and the Plaintiff, because the plaintiff and I were becoming very close and some of the meetings the plaintiff and I had were actually dates. The Plaintiff and Mrs. Chiu met only occasionally in social settings over the two and a half years of their acquaintance.</P>
<P>81. In response to paragraph 47 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in or about January 2016 that she wanted to invest in Europe. She stated so specifically in her email of January 24, 2016 (Wei #1 Affidavit, Exhibit N). The plaintiff also told me she would like to buy a house in London for our own use. Based on her interest in Europe, the Plaintiff and I travelled to Europe in mid-September 2016 to take a vacation together and also to investigate investment opportunities there, such as properties in Central London and vineyards in Bordeaux.</P>
<P>82. In response to paragraph 48 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in May 2016, there was much discussion in the press and other media about Brexit. There was also much discus sion between me and the Plaintiff about Brexit and about investment opportunities for the Plaintiff in the United Kingdom. The Plaintiff and I discussed buying property in the UK while the sterling was low and also in making profits in foreign exchange tra des between US Dollars and UK Sterling.</P>
<P>83. In response to paragraph 49 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff was never reluctant about investing in the United Kingdom. She was eager to diversify her assets for tax avoidance and she talked with me about setting up a British Virgin Islands (&ldquo;BVI&rdquo;) company to hold some of her Beijing properties as well as the pending investments she planned to make in Europe and the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>84. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of a WeChat exchange between me and the Plaintiff on November 11, 2016 asking me to speak with her Singapore lawyers about transferring her Beijing properties into her BVI company.</P>
<P>85. I travelled to Singapore with the Plaintiff in June 2016 to take a vacation together and also to help her in her dealings with Singapore lawyers to set up a BVI company to hold some of the Plaintiff's assets.</P>
<P>86. In response to paragraph 50 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in May 2016 that she would provide me further funds (which were to be used together with funds she had earlier given me) to hold and when the right opportunity arose, purchase for her suitable investments in the United Kingdom property and stock markets.</P>
<P>87. In response to paragraph 51 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the P laintiff told me in May 2016 that she would start by giving me an additional USD$300,000 that she wished me to hold for her, with the intention to invest in the UK once we identify the right investments. I have no idea of the source of the funds but I accep ted the funds and did not ask questions because of our intimate relationship. That said, the plaintiff had advised me throughout our relationship that her husband Huai Xin Li, was using some illegal underground banks in China to transfer funds out of C hina to the plaintiff's accounts in Canada and elsewhere.</P>
<P>88. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C1&rdquo;</BOLD> are WeChat messages from plaintiff informing me of transfers from unknown sources and references illegal underground banks in China to carryout transfers such that she may transfer funds from China to Canada/Hong Kong.</P>
<P>89. In response to paragraph 52 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the purpose of this agreement was to be a statement of intent to give both me and the Plaintiff a level of comfort, as I was holding funds for the plaintiff, and knowing the questionable source of funds, and also since the Plaintiff and I both knew I was not a professional investment manager and that I was only helping her out of my love and affection for her and as part of our ongoing personal relationship. The Plaintiff and I agreed that the document was unenforceable and was simply to outline I was holding funds for the plaintiff for certain proposed investments in the future.</P>
<P>90. In response to paragraph 53 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, on or about May 17, 2016, the Plaintiff told me that she had deposited the money into Mrs. Chiu's account. It was also around the same time that the Plaintiff and I were planning our trip to Singapore for the following month, June, 2016. The plaintiff told me I could use the funds I was holding for her to pay for all of the expenses of our pending Singapore trip.</P>
<P>91. In June 2016, the Plaintiff and I travelled together to Singapore. We met there with BVI lawyers and accountants, as well as with representatives of Offshore Incorporated Limited (&ldquo;OIL&rdquo;). While in Singapore, the Plaintiff formed a BVI company by the name of &ldquo;Century Lane Investment Ltd.&rdquo; The Plaintiff told me that her plans were to transfer her undeclared assets from China and elsewhere into the BVI company, with a purpose to hide those undeclared assets from tax authorities in Canada and China.</P>
<P>92. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a copy of a record of incorporation for Century Lane Investment Ltd. showing the Plaintiff as a Director of that company, the application to incorporate, payment information, and her identification records including both her Canadian and Chinese passport.</P>
<P>93. In response to paragraph 55 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, one of the Plaintiff's Las Vegas houses was sold in July of 2016. I was involved in every stage of the process as requested by the Plaintiff to help her deal with her real estate agent in Las Vegas.</P>
<P>94. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of an email message of June 8, 2016 from the real estate agent, Frances Cox, to me and the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>95. In further response to paragraph 55 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff's statement about me learning of the house sale and pressuring her to give more money is false. It was all along the Plaintiffs plan, since December 2015, to sell her Las Vegas properties and use the sale proceeds to diversify into the European market through the BVI company to hide her assets from CRA and Chinese tax authorities.</P>
<P>96. In response to paragraph 56 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff told me in early August 2016 that she would give me another USD$200,000 to hold for her and when the timing is right, the funds are to be used to invest in the right opportunity in the UK. It was also around this time that the Plaintiff and I were planning a trip to Europe to evaluate market conditions and property investment opportunities. Again, the source of funds from the plaintiff was unknown and, as previously advised by the plaintiff, the funds came from illegal underground banks sent by her husband Huai Xin Li, from China and Hong Kong. At the time, it became clear to me as to why the plaintiff wants me to hold funds for her, because the source of the funds were questionable and she did not want to attract the attention of tax authorities. I agreed to help due to my relationship with the plaintiff and my affection for her.</P>
<P>97. In response to paragraph 57 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, after the Plaintiff told me that she had deposited USD$200,000 into Mrs. Chiu's account, she asked me to prepare another unofficial agreement regarding our proposed investment capital together in the UK. At the time, the Plaintiff and I were deeply in love so I did anything she asked of me. Neither of us specified exactly what investments would be purchased in the UK. The Plaintiff and I together were going to make investment decisions after we had visited Europe.</P>
<P>98. In response to paragraph 59 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not provide to the Plaintiff the summary which forms Exhibit S to the Wei #1 Affidavit. I had not seen this document prior to reading the Wei #1 Affidavit.</P>
<P>99. In response to paragraph 60 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not recommend NTB to the Plaintiff as a good investment. The Plaintiff and I had many discussions about possible investments, but I do not recall NTB being one of them.</P>
<P>100. In response to paragraph 61 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not sell any NTB shares to the Plaintiff. At that time in October 2016, I asked the Plaintiff for a loan to settle some personal debt.</P>
<P>101. In response to paragraph 62 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I repeat that I made no commitment to purchase any shares in NTB for the Plaintiff. At that time in October 2016, I asked the Plaintiff for a loan to settle some personal debt of about US$250,000. The Plaintiff loaned me that amount without any conditions.</P>
<P>102. In response to paragraph 64 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. The only relationship between the Plaintiff and Mrs. C hiu was that of a social acquaintance without any business relationship. Whereas, the relationship between me and the Plaintiff was an intimate one which also included daily discussions about trading stocks in the Plaintiff's trading accounts and at times explored other investment opportunities with funds of the Plaintiff held by me at her direction.</P>
<P>103. In further response to paragraph 64 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, from June 2015 to April 2017, I helped the Plaintiff trade stocks in both her CIBC Investors' Ed ge account (US Portfolio) and her Essence International Hong Kong trading account (Hong Kong Portfolio). In 2016 alone, I helped the Plaintiff earn a profit of over USD$300,000 in her Hong Kong Portfolio alone.</P>
<P>104. I have been helping the Plaintiff in trading and making money without any compensation since July 3, 2016. I got up every trading morning at 6:30am to help trade US stocks for the Plaintiff without any compensation out of my love and affection for her and because I was in a serious, intimate relationship with her and we had complete trust in each other when it came to money matters.</P>
<P>105. In response to paragraph 65 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, after the Plaintiff and I began our intimate relationship, it became clear that the Plaintiff's motive was for me to hold funds for her to avoid tax implications, as her investment instructions became less clear. The only clear investment decisions were the daily trading activities that I made for the plaintiff regarding trading in her CIBC Investors' Edge account (US Portfolio) as well as her Hong Kong Essence International trading accounts (Hong Kong Portfolio). Although we had many discussions and verbal agreements as to how and where the Plaintiff wished to invest, she would change her mind often and revoke or ch ange her instructions to me. Any money the plaintiff gave to me was held by me such that the plaintiff could avoid tax implications and to respond to directions of the Plaintiff with respect to investments or other uses, such as travelling expenses.</P>
<P>106. In response to paragraph 66 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff and I often talked about property markets around the world, but I did not tell her that I or Mrs. Chiu owned properties in Singapore, San Francisco, London or elsewhere around the world. Neither I nor Mrs. Chiu owned any real property during the time between meeting the Plaintiff in 2015 and the present.</P>
<P>107. In response to paragraph 67 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff did not pay me or Mrs. Chiu USD$44,000 for commissions or management fees in the period from June 2015 to October 2016. In the course of our relationship which was during that period of time and extended beyond it to May, 2017, the plaintiff loaned me money and she also gave me money to hold on her behalf. Some of those funds were us ed with her consent for my personal use as well as to pay for our joint entertainment and travelling expenses. As stated in paragraph 103 above, I helped the Plaintiff in trading and making money without any compensation since July 3, 2016.</P>
<P>108. In response to paragraph 68 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in June 2016, I went to Singapore with the Plaintiff at her request and at her expense to set up a BVI company and to spend vacation time together with the Plaintiff who complained that her exhusband had rarely travelled with her.</P>
<P><BOLD>109.</BOLD> In further response to paragraph 68 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in September 2016, at the Plaintiff's request, the Plaintiff and I travelled together to Europe for vacation as well as to explore business and investment opportunities. On that trip, I spent lavishly at the Plaintiff's request because she told me that her ex-husband treated her badly, that she rarely travelled and that she had not really lived before. The Plaintiff told me that she wanted to live it up with me. During that trip and the earlier one to Singapore, expenses were never an issue, the Plaintiff and I talked about and it did not matter who paid for what, because we saw a future together. I spent on the joint expenses of myself and the Plaintiff around USD$40,000 during our Singapore trip and over USD$100,000 during our trip to Europe. With consent from the plaintiff, those monies came from funds I was holding for the plaintiff. Where I used credit card to pay expenses, I paid the credit card bills from funds held by me on the plaintiff's behalf.</P>
<P>110. In response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff and I were not only &ldquo;at times involved in a romantic way&rdquo;. I was very much involved in almost every aspect of the Plaintiff's daily life as her partner since our intimate relationship began in early 2016. At the Plaintiff's request, I would help her in almost every aspect of her daily life, dealing with issues big or small including issues pertaining to her children.</P>
<P>111. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have accompanied the Plaintiff to appointments with her doctor.</P>
<P>112. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of December 6, 2016 concerning my accompanying the Plaintiff to her medical appointment.</P>
<P>113. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have accompanied the Plaintiff to appointments with her son's school principal. Her son is Lan Meng (David) Li, he attend St Georges School.</P>
<P>114. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of October 25, 2016 concerning my accompanying the Plaintiff to a meeting with her son's school principal.</P>
<P>115. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have accompanied the Plaintiff to appointments with her daughter's UBC counsellor to discuss her daughter's first year course selection. Daughter's name is Lan Xin (Catherine) Li, she is a student at UBC.</P>
<P>116. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G1a to G1c&rdquo;</BOLD> are WeChat messages from plaintiff requesting my help.</P>
<P>117. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I witnessed the Plaintiff's signature on a field trip medical form document permitting her son to attend a school organized trip to Europe.</P>
<P>118. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of October 23, 2016 concerning the Plaintiff's request that I witness her signature.</P>
<P>119. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have accompanied the Plaintiff to a fund-raising meeting at her son's school.</P>
<P>120. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of an email message exchange of October 24, 2016 concerning my accompanying the Plaintiff to the fund-raising meeting.</P>
<P>121. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have accompanied the Plaintiff to meetings with her accountants and have helped her deal with tax planning and income tax returns.</P>
<P>122. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of August 24, 2016 concerning a reassessment by CRA of the Plaintiff's 2014 tax return. The Plaintiff asked me to assist her with the CRA reassessment and I met with her and her accountants, BDO Dunwoody, on numerous occasions in April 2016 and with her and her accountant, Lily Chen, on numerous occasions in March 2017.</P>
<P>123. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have assisted the Plaintiff with management of her Las Vegas rental properties and dealing with Frances Cox, the Plaintiff's real estate agent in Las Vegas.</P>
<P>124. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of an email message exchange of between May 27 and June 2, 2016 between me, the Plaintiff and Frances Cox concerning the Plaintiff's Las Vegas properties.</P>
<P>125. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I was the Plaintiff's designated point of contact for communications with her home alarm system and I held the pass code for the Plaintiff's home alarm system.</P>
<P>126. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of November 17, 2016 concerning my access to the Plaintiff's alarm system.</P>
<P>127. In further response to paragraph 69 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, during the period from early 2016 to March 2017, the Plaintiff and I were in love and planning our future together.</P>
<P>128. In response to paragraph 70 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in October 2016, after the Plaintiff and I had returned to Vancouver from our trip to Europe, I asked the Plaintiff for a personal loan. At that time, I also told the Plaintiff that I had used some of the funds I was holding for her for other purposes, including expenses. In response, the Plaintiff told me that she considered the funds I had used to be a gift. She further stated she did not expect me to pay her back, but if I had the ability to pay her back, the money would be payable only when I was able to do so. The Plaintiff also told me that she was agreeable to permitting you to use the funds you held on her behalf out of love and affection, because I was helping her to earn good returns in her trading accounts and because our finances would soon be merged anyway as we were then planning to move in together. Specifically, she said I could forget the money spent because it was already spent. We even explored the idea of moving to London UK and settling there. The Plaintiff and I agreed to the terms of a conditional loan by which I would repay to her the sums borrowed when I was able to do so and also the loan could be offset by the profits that I helped her earn in her trading accounts.</P>
<P>129. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of August 8, 2016 where the Plaintiff states (in Chinese text) that it is time we went hunting for a house in London as the GB Pound Sterling had fallen.</P>
<P>130. In response to paragraph 71 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, in November, 2016, the Plaintiff suspected that there may be a reconciliation between me and Mrs. Chiu from whom I had separated. As a result, the Plaintiff became extremely jealous and she sent me an email talking about some investments that did not exist but the Plaintiff claimed that I was holding for her. At the time, it was clear that the plaintiff had reneged on her verbal consent that the money I held on her behalf and I had used with her consent was a gift and the agreement that I could pay her when I was able to.</P>
<P>131. In further response to paragraph 71 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I told the Plaintiff in a mid-November 2016 meeting that I was, at that time, unable to repay her any money and that I needed time to raise some money. The Plaintiff was very upset during that meeting and drew up by hand a form of Promissory Note for me to sign.</P>
<P>132. In response to paragraph 72 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I told the Plaintiff none of the things she has sworn I told her. I told her only that Mrs. Chiu was planning to leave me because of my relationship with the Plaintiff. I did not loan Mrs. Chiu money for a fashion business. Mrs. Chiu does not have a fashi on business or any business at all. My daughter does not and did not attend a private school in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>133. In response to paragraph 73 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not sign the Promissory Note which the Plaintiff presented to me at the mid-November 2016 meeting. The signature on Exhibit V to the Wei #1 Affidavit, is not my signature.</P>
<P>134. In further response to paragraph 73 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, although Exhibit V to the Wei #1 Affidavit describes a house and property in Singapore, I do not now n or have I ever owned a property of that description. Further, I did not tell the Plaintiff that I owned such a property.</P>
<P>135. The Plaintiff and I had several more quarrels during November 2016, all of which revolved around the Plaintiff's concern that I was reconciling with Mrs. Chiu. After many discussions on the topic, the Plaintiff and I resumed our personal relationship and we resumed life as a couple as before.</P>
<P>136. The Plaintiff and I met almost every day and went for lunches, dinners, movies and long hikes on the weekends as well as other activities which normal couples do. I helped the Plaintiff book her Christmas family vacation in Hawaii with her children. The Plaintiff wanted me to join her on that vacation but with her children there, it was not convenient. The Plaintiff told me that due to her divorce agreement with her ex-husband the Plaintiff is prohibited from dating until their son, the younger of the Plaintiff's two children, is enrolled in university.</P>
<P>137. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit is a copy of WeChat message exchange of November 6, 2016 where the Plaintiff invited me to join her in Maui for Christmas 2016 and messages from December 26, 2016 while on holidays.</P>
<P>138. Although I was often in and around the Plaintiff's house and her children knew me, the Plaintiff told me that I had to keep a low profile in front of her children to prevent her ex-husband from finding out about our relationship.</P>
<P>139. In response to paragraph 74 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintif f is false. The Plaintiff did not demand repayment of the loan she had made to me. I told her my wife was considering a divorce.</P>
<P>140. In further response to paragraph 74 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, during the period March 29&ndash;31, 2017, my relationship with the Plaintiff continued as normal with meals and outings taken together. I continued to take and give trading instructions to the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>141. Attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit are copies of WeChat message exchanges of March 29, 30 and 31, 2017 made between me and the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>142. In response to paragraph 75 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I was not suspicious of the Plaintiff recording our conversation on March 28, 2017 and neither did I ask her if she was recording it. At that time, the Plaintiff and I were still in a loving relationship as well as continuing to trade stocks together and corresponding via WeChat as a couple.</P>
<P>143. In response to paragraph 76 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. In the days following March 28, 2016, the Plaintiff and I were still carrying on our relationship and meeting for meals and other activities. We did not have a meeting at that time about repayment of the personal loan and I did not ask the Plaintiff to bring any documents or banking records.</P>
<P>144. In response to paragraph 77 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I met with the Plaintiff on April 6, 2017 and, relying on her previous instructions that I could repay funds when I was able to, I made a partial repayment of USD$14,000 to be applied against the Plaintiff's personal loan to me and the Plaintiff gave me a receipt for the payment.</P>
<P>145. In further response to paragraph 77 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit a copy of a receipt for USD$14,000 signed by the Plaintiff and dated April 6, 2017.</P>
<P>146. In further response to paragraph 77 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I did not steal the Plaintiff's iPhone as she has stated. In fact, I was the first person she called to help her find it. The Plaintiff called me about 2 hours after our meeting of April 6, 2017 and I helped her return to the Starbuck's restaurant where we had met and I helped her look for her phone without success. I suggested that she file a lost phone report with her service provider.</P>
<P>147. In response to paragraph 78 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, it was not on April 9, 2017 but rather on April 25, 2017 that I met with the Plaintiff to give her another payment of USD$20,000 in cash to be applied against the personal loan. I did not ask the Plaintiff to sign a loan agreement at that meeting.</P>
<P>148. In further response to paragraph 78 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have attached hereto and marked <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit a copy of a receipt for USD$20,000 signed by the Plaintiff and dated April 25, 2017.</P>
<P>149. In further response to paragraph 78 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I was in regular, daily contact with the Plaintiff after April 25, 2017 to discuss a repayment schedule. The Plaintiff ceased contact with me in early May 2017. On May 3, 2017, the Plaintiff and I spoke and, at that time, the Plaintiff was still asking me about stocks and potential investments. She specifically asked how to diversify the Hong Kong Portfolio into several smaller accounts in preparation for the implementation of Common Reporting System (&ldquo;CRS&rdquo;) and the potential resulting taxation consequences for the Plaintiff anticipated in July 2017.</P>
<P>150. In response to paragraph 79 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have not taken any steps to hide or dissipate my assets.</P>
<P>151. In response to paragraph 80 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I did not recommend a BVI account for the Plaintiff and I do not have any BVI or Offshore company accounts myself. The Plaintiff has knowledge about BVI companies from her ex-husband who the Plaintiff told me is hiding a lot of assets under a BVI company as well as in offshore companies in other jurisdictions. The Plaintiff herself formed a BVI company while we were in Singapore together in June 2016. In or about April 2017, the Plaintiff told me that, in an effort to hide her assets from CRA and the Chinese tax authorities, she was considering buying a new identity and a new passport from a small island nation such as Seychelles or Dominican Republic and that the cost would be about USD$750,000. The Plaintiff told me that this is the latest trend and method used by Mainland Chinese nationals to hide their assets from CRS that will be introduced in 2017 by most countries in the world including Canada and China.</P>
<P>152. In response to paragraph 81 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I communicated with the Plaintiff regularly on a daily basis and she was aware of my whereabouts and travel plans at all times. In early May 2017, I told the Plaintiff that I would repay her USD$70,000 on May 16, 2017, but she did not even give me a chance to do that because she filed the Notice of Civil Claim to commence this Action on May 12, 2017.</P>
<P>153. In response to paragraph 82 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I received a WeChat message from the Plaintiff on May 11, 2017 (Pacific Standard Time) while I was in Hong Kong. The plaintiff asked me to call her, which I did.</P>
<P>154. In response to paragraphs 84&ndash;86 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I had a telephone conversation with the Plaintiff on May 12, 2017 while I was in Hong Kong and I told he r that I planned to repay her the personal loan but that I needed more time to do so. She was very emotional because she thought I was reconciling with Mrs. Chiu. This was a recurring pattern in our relationship. The Plaintiff would be easy going and agr eeable when she felt secure in our relationship but whenever she felt that there was possibility of a reconciliation between me and Mrs. Chiu, she would take a completely different tone and would renege on her verbal agreement regarding our personal loan. I did not tell the Plaintiff in our telephone conversation of May 12, 2017 that I had already travelled to Hong Kong with Mrs Chiu, because I did not want to upset her.</P>
<P>155. In further response to paragraph 86 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, the Plaintiff was well aware of my plans to travel to Hong Kong in early May 2017 and she had planned to join me there in mid-May if she could arrange for her ex-husband to travel to Vancouver to stay with her children. In the event that her ex-husband was not available at that time, the Plaintiff and I had discussed the opportunity to meet in Hong Kong in June 2017 when her son would be visiting family in China.</P>
<P>156. In response to paragraph 87 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. From the start of our relationship in 2015, I told the Plaintiff that I had owned and operated a company in Singapore with the name Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd. and that that company was no longer in existence. The Singapore company was not a subsidiary, parent or sister company to an Alberta company which operated under the name, &ldquo;Stoneset Equities&rdquo; and I was never an employee of that Alberta company or any Alberta company of a similar name.</P>
<P>157. In response to paragraph 88 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I was not aware that the P laintiff had engaged a private investigator to research my past while the Plaintiff and I were still carrying on an intimate relationship as described elsewhere in this Affidavit.</P>
<P>158. In response to paragraphs 89&ndash;93 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I was not aware that the Plaintiff had engaged others to conduct research into my past.</P>
<P>159. In further response to paragraph 90 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I never claimed to the Plaintiff or to any other person that I had the credentials, qualifications or work experience listed in that paragraph.</P>
<P>160. In further response to paragraph 91 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I do not now nor have I ever owned property in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>161. In further response to paragraph 93 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, I have no knowledge of the items listed there except that, per paragraph 93b, I do not own any property in Singapore.</P>
<P>162. In response to paragraph 94 of the Wei #1 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I have never owned property in Singapore directly or indirectly and I have never held any interest in or position in a BVI company and neither did I tell the Plaintiff any such thing.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT #2 OF RONG (ELIZA) WEI</UNDER></TI>
<P>163. I have read the Affidavit #2 of the Plaintiff sworn herein 16 May 2017 (the &ldquo;Wei #2 Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>164. In response to paragraph 5 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. The Plaintiff and I never discussed ownership of ray residence in Vancouver but the fact is that I rented my residence. I have not owned property anywhere in the world since 2015.</P>
<P>165. In response to paragraph 7 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, the Birney Property was, prior to August 2018, the residence of myself and Mrs. Chiu. Mrs. Chiu and I were separated temporarily after she found out the plaintiff and I were having an affair but I never told the Plaintiff that I did not know the whereabouts of Mrs. Chiu.</P>
<P>166. In response to paragraph 8 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, the Plaintiff could have contacted Mrs. Chiu via her cell phone or via the WeChat texting app.</P>
<P>167. In response to paragraph 9 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, I had no plans to meet with the Plaintiff on May 14, 2017 but, as stated above, I did speak by telephone with the Plaintiff on May 12, 2017.</P>
<P>168. In response to paragraph 10 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, I told the Plaintiff on May 12, 2017 that I intended to pay her USD$70,000 in the week of May 16, 2017 to be applied against the personal loan she had made to me.</P>
<P>169. In response to paragraph 11 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, it is the Plaintiff who was deceiving me by continuing in a loving and intimate relationship with me while, at the same time, hiring private investigators and others to investigate my past.</P>
<P>170. In response to paragraph 12 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, on May 12, 2017, the Plaintiff knew, from our conversation of the same date, that I was not at home that day.</P>
<P>171. In response to paragraph 13 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, the Plaintiff knew from our conversation of the previous day that I was not planning on being home on May 13, 2017. As the Exhibits to this Affidavit show, the Plaintiff and I were, for many months, in daily contact by email, text message and telephone and the Plaintiff could have contacted me by those methods on May 13, 2017.</P>
<P>172. In response to paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, the Plaintiff was well aware of my plans to travel to Hong Kong in early May 2017 and she knew on May 14, 2017 that I had already travelled to Hong Kong on May 10, 2017. The Plaintiff and I had made plans to meet up in Hong Kong later in June 2017.</P>
<P>173. The plaintiff's efforts to serve me with documents at my home when she knew I had already travelled to Hong Kong are a blatant effort by the Plaintiff to mislead the Court that I had gone into hiding.</P>
<P>174. In response to paragraphs 17&ndash;22 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, the Plaintiff had various means to contact me or Mrs. Chiu by email, text message and telephone but chose not to do so.</P>
<P>175. In response to paragraph 23 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, I normally used credit cards when I travelled together with the Plaintiff but sometimes had to use cash in places where credit cards were not accepted. I did not and do not travel with large amounts of cash.</P>
<P>176. In response to paragraphs 24 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, this statement by the Plaintiff is false. I do not keep cash in a safe deposit box and neither did I tell the Plaintiff any of the things alleged in paragraph 24 of the Wei #2 Affidavit.</P>
<P>177. In response to paragraphs 25&ndash;27 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, I did not prepare or present to the Plaintiff an investment summary and I do not have a TD Bank account.</P>
<P>178. In response to paragraphs 28&ndash;30 of the Wei #2 Affidavit, I do not have a Scotiabank account.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>ADDITIONAL RELEVANT DOCUMENTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>179. Throughout the period to which I was helping her make trades, the plaintiff was extremely happy with the results.</P>
<P>180. Attached hereto marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit are copies of WeChat text messages between me and the Plaintiff in which she expresses her happiness with the results.</P>

<P>I, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the wife of the Co-Defendant Allan Chiu and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. The native language I speak is Cantonese. I have a basic grasp of the English language. The contents of this, my affidavit, has been explained to me by my counsel and with the assistance of Serene Chow, a Cantonese speaking lawyer at Boughton Law. Following the explanation, I advise that I understand the information contained in this affidavit as written in English.</P>
<P>3. In the fall of 2015, I was aware that the plaintiff and my husband were meeting quite frequently and I started to be suspicious as to the nature of their relationship.</P>
<P>4. By the spring of 2016, I knew the plaintiff and my husband were in an intimate relationship and more confirmation came when they started to travel on trips together.</P>
<P>5. I knew that funds contained in my CIBC account in Vancouver were somehow related to the relationship between my husband and the plaintiff. I was aware that Allan was assisting the plaintiff in some capacity with trading but I did not know all of the details, purpose of the transactions, or the sources of the funds.</P>
<P>6. Beginning in April 2017, I was seriously considering separating from my husband. I determined that I did not want the funds that were related to the relationship between my husband and the plaintiff in my CIBC account. I transferred the funds from my CIBC account and delivered them to my husband's accounts. As such, I made four transactions to transfer funds:
<P1>(a) On April 10, 2017, I transferred the sum of $50,000 USD to my husband's Standard Chartered account in Singapore. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is my CIBC Account Statement for April 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is the bank record for the transfer of $50,000 on April 10, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a branch copy of the transfer of $50,000 USD to my husband's Standard Chartered Account in Singapore;</P1>
<P1>(b) On April 12, 2017, I transferred the sum of $120,000 USD to my husband's Standard Chartered account in Singapore. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is the bank record for the transfer of $120,000 USD on April 12, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a branch copy of the transfer of $120,000 USD to my husband's Standard Chartered Account in Singapore;</P1>
<P1>(c) On May 15, 2017 PST, I transferred the sum of $175,000 USD to my husband's Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong. At the time, I was in Hong Kong and on May 16, 2017 at 12:04am HKT, which was May 15, 2017 at 9:04 am PST, I delivered a fax to my CIBC branch at University Boulevard Banking Centre to provide my instructions. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is my CIBC Account Statement for May 1, 2017 to May 18, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is the bank record for the transfer of $175,000 on May 15, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a branch copy of the transfer of $175,000 USD to my husband's Bank of China (HK) Account in Hong Kong. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is copy of my instructions to CIBC; and</P1>
<P1>(d) On May 17, 2017 PST, I transferred the sum of $100,000 USD to my husband's Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong. At the time, I was in Hong Kong and on May 17, 2017 at 11:46 pm HKT, which was May 17, 2017 at 8:46 am PST, I delivered a fax to my CIBC branch at University Boulevard Banking Centre to provide my instructions. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is the bank record for the transfer of $100,000 on May 17, 2017. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is copy of my instructions to CIBC.</P1></P>
<P>7. I was not aware of pending litigation against my husband or myself at the time I made the transfers referenced above.</P>
<P>8. On May 10, 2017, I travelled to Hong Kong as I continued to be unsure of whether I wished to maintain my relationship with my husband. I returned to Vancouver on September 10, 2017.</P>
<P>9. I recall that my husband advised me of the lawsuit against me one or two days before a telephone conference call with Jef Polsen on May 25, 2017 at approximately 6:00 am HKT. This was the first time I became aware of the lawsuit filed against me.</P>
<P>10. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action dated December 5, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Allan Chiu, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700 - 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. By the spring of 2017, my wife having been aware that I was involved in an intimate relationship with the plaintiff for approximately one year could no longer tolerate the relationship.</P>
<P>3. As a result, my wife informed me, in or around March, 2017, that she was considering a separation. Further, my wife advised me that the she was going to transfer all funds that were in her CIBC account that were related to the plaintiff to my accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
<P>4. As a result, I received a total of four transactions from my wife's account in Canada into my bank accounts:
<P1>(a) On April 10, 2017, $50,000USD was deposited to my Standard Chartered account in Singapore;</P1>
<P1>(b) On April 12, 2017, $120,000USD was deposited to my Standard Chartered account in Singapore;</P1>
<P1>(c) On May 14, 2017, $175,000USD was deposited to my Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong; and</P1>
<P1>(d) On May 16, 2017, $100,000USD was deposited to my Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong.</P1></P>
<P>5. On May 10, 2018, I travelled with my wife to Hong Kong for the purpose of saving our marriage. I was aware that my wife was considering a separation. At times, the relationship was tense. At other times, we were working things out and the relationship appeared positive.</P>
<P>6. Soon after my arrival in Hong Kong, I made four transfers from the Standard Chartered Account in Singapore to my Bank of China (HK) account, the particulars are contained in this my affidavit at paragraph 11 as follows:
<P1>(a) On May 16, 2017, I transferred $10,000USD;</P1>
<P1>(b) On May 16, 2017, I transferred $60,000USD;</P1>
<P1>(c) On May 17, 2017, I transferred $70,000USD; and</P1>
<P1>(d) On May 23, 2017, I transferred $29,000USD.</P1></P>
<P>7. I needed the funds to be transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong to settle perso nal debts and pay expenses. I have a gambling problem. When I refer to &ldquo;personal debts&rdquo; within this affidavit it refers to the following circumstances:
<P1>(a) starting in approximately the fall of 2016, I accumulated and amassed debt from unsanctioned gambling;</P1>
<P1>(b) I was actively gambling on horse races, card games, and dice games;</P1>
<P1>(c) I was loaned funds from &ldquo;loan sharks&rdquo; to support my gambling problem;</P1>
<P1>(d) the loans came with threats of physical violence to me and family members if they were not repaid; and</P1>
<P1>(e) over the course of 2016-2017, my debt was approximately $2,000,000HKD and was growing as a result of high interest charges that the &ldquo;loans sharks&rdquo; applied to the loan.</P1></P>
<P>8. Shortly after my arrival in Hong Kong, I received phone calls and had in-person discussions with the &ldquo;loan sharks&rdquo;. They threatened me and advised that I had to pay my outstanding debt or they would cause physical harm to me and my family.</P>
<P>9. To secure the personal safety of my family and myself, I attended to satisfying the loan which included using funds in my Bank of China (HK) account.</P>
<P>10. I include below a chart referencing the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. Bank in my name with account number XXXXXXXXXX between the dates of May 12, 2017 and August 31, 2017 as contained in Affidavit #3 of Tina Le&mdash;December 5, 2018&mdash;Exhibit G&mdash;Pages 39-40. The date and time of the transactions in the document titled &ldquo;C.I.F. System A/C Financial History Transaction List&rdquo; are times in Hong Kong. The dates and times contained in the chart below were completed for me by staff at the office of my legal counsel and I verily believe the calculation of the dates and times to be correct.</P>
<P>11. The explanation contained under the head &ldquo;the circumstances of the transaction&rdquo; are a combination of facts that I recall, facts that I have been ab le to recall on review of financial records, and where stated, are believed to be true.</P>

<P>16. On May 17, 2017 at 8:15am HKT, which was May 16, 2017 at 5:15pm PST, an e-mail was delivered to my e-mail account at allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia from Gail Major. The e-mail is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> affidavit of Tina Le dated December 5, 2018 at pages 2-3.</P>
<P>17. I am unable to recall the specific time or time of day I viewed the e-mail from Gail Major. However, I recall seeing the name Gail Major and that her name was unfamiliar to me. Even without opening the e-mail, I saw attachments were included in the e-mail. As such, I did not open the e-mail. I did not open the e-mail of Gail Major dated May 16, 2017 until approximately 2 weeks after receipt.</P>
<P>18. On May 20, 2017 at 6:04am HKT, which was May 19, 2017 at 3:04pm PST, I received another e-mail from Gail Major. In the subject line to the e-mail, I saw the words &ldquo;order&rdquo;. I realized I should talk to legal counsel. I attended to searching for legal counsel in Ca nada. I recall opening this e-mail either immediately prior to my phone call with Jef Poulsen or while on the telephone with Jef Poulsen. I do not recall the specific time. I did not open the attachment immediately. The e-mail is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> affidavit of Tina Le dated December 5, 2018 at page 5.</P>
<P>19. On May 20, 2017 at around 8 am HKT, I was able to reach Jef Poulsen at Poulsen Law. Mr. Poulsen advised me that it was around 5:00 pm on a Friday in Vancouver, Mr. Poulsen advised me he was leaving the office. He requested that I forward to him the documents I received.</P>
<P>20. On May 20, 2017, between 8:21 am and 8:29 am HKT, I forwarded the e-mail of Gail Major dated May 19, 2017 at 3:04pm PST to Mr. Poulsen. I forwarded the e-mail twice as I had received a &ldquo;bounce-back&rdquo; and I believed the first e-mail had been rejected. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a copy of the e-mails to Mr. Poulsen from May 19, 2017 to May 23, 2017.</P>
<P>21. At some point on May 20, 2017 HKT, I opened the attachment in the Gail Major e-mail dated May 19, 2017 at 3:04pm PST containing the Mareva Order. I read the Mareva Order and the reference to a freezing order. I did not understand all of the terms contained in the Mareva Order.</P>
<P>22. The following morning, on May 21, 2017 at 10:05 am HKT, which was May 20, 2017 at 7:05pm PST, I delivered a message to the plaintiff to offer funds and in exchange requested she remove the freezing order.</P>
<P>23. On May 23, 2017 at 9:27 am PST, which was May 24, 2017 at 12:27am, I e-mailed Mr. Poulsen as I had not heard from him to inform him that my wife and I wished to retain him for the purposes of applying for an extension to file a response. I wrote in my e-mail that we had a &ldquo;... pressing response deadline of the court order on May 25 (7 days from Thursday, May 18)&rdquo;. I did not understand that I could apply to discharge or vary the order at the time I delivered the e-mail to Mr. Poulsen.</P>
<P>24. On May 23, 2017 at 2:30 pm PST, which was May 24, 2017 at 5:30am, I received an e-mail from Jef Poulsen. He advised that he needed to obtain copies of the Application and Affidavits that were filed with respect to the Order. I was not aware prior to receiving this e-mail from Mr. Poulsen that the documents he requested were contained in the first e-mail from Gail Major dated May 16, 2017 at 5:15pm PST.</P>
<P>25. On May 25, 2017 at approximately 6:00 am HKT, I talked to Mr. Poulsen and Mr. Riley by telephone with my wife present with me in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>26. During my discussions with legal counsel, I came to understand that my accounts outside of British Columbia were subject to the Mareva Order and not to be used in contravention of the order.</P>
<P>27. As delineated above, after learning the effect of the Mareva Order, I only used funds contained in the account pursuant to the exception contained in the order contained at paragraph 4 which prohibiting my wife and I from spending more than $3,500 each per month on ordinary living expenses.</P>
<P>28. I deposited funds into the account on June 9, 2017 and subsequently withdrew the funds for livin g expenses. The withdrawals subsequent to June 9, 2017 were reported to the Plaintiff as evidenced at paragraph 5 to the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> affidavit of Tina Le dated December 5, 2018.</P>
<P>29. I had no intention to dispose of or hide assets. I withdrew the funds deposited by my wife to satisfy personal debts and pay for living expenses while in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>30. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action dated December 5, 2018 regarding orders for contempt of court.</P>

<P>Name of applicant: Rong (Eliza) Wei</P>
<P>TO: Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu and Allan Chiu</P>
<P>AND TO: Their Solicitors</P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge or master at the courthouse at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia on February 19, 2019, at 9:45 a.m. for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Against Mui Kwan Queenie Lau</TI>
<P>1. A declaration that Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mui Kwan Queenie Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Ms. Lau</BOLD>&rdquo;) is in contempt of court, with penalty hearing to follow, by reason of one or more of the following:
<P1>a. breaching paragraphs 1 and 4 of the order of Madam Justice Humphries dated May 18, 2017 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Mareva Order</BOLD>&rdquo;), in May 2017, October 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2017, February 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018;</P1>
<P1>b. breaching paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order, as varied by paragraph 8 the order of Mr. Justice Grauer dated December 4, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>December 2018 Order</BOLD>), in December 2018;</P1>
<P1>c. for refusing or neglecting to attend without lawful excuse at the time and place appointed for her examination for discovery on September 27, 2018, December 19, 2018, and January 18, 2019; and</P1>
<P1>d. breaching paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order by failing since in or about December 2017 to advise the plaintiff of her sources of spending.</P1></P>
<P>2. An order that the response to civil claim of Ms. Lau filed on August 30, 2017, be struck out and the proceeding continue as if no response to civil claim had been filed.</P>
<P>3. An order that special costs of this application be payable by Ms. Lau forthwith in any event of the cause.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Against Allan Chiu</TI>
<P>4. Within 7 days of the date of this order, or such other time as this Honourable Court order permits, Allan Chiu (&ldquo;<BOLD>Mr. Chiu</BOLD>&rdquo;) produce to the Applicant the documents and classes of documents set out at <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this notice of application.</P>
<P>5. Costs of the application.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Overview of Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. This case concerns the actions of Mr. Chiu and his wife Ms. Lau, who between 2015 and 2016 received from the plaintiff, Rong (Eliza) Wei (&ldquo;<BOLD>Ms. Wei</BOLD>&rdquo;), approximately USD$1.1 million to invest on her behalf.</P>
<P>7. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau did not invest the funds they received from Ms. Wei and did not provide Ms. Wei a return on her investment. Instead, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau converted Ms. Wei's funds to their own uses. Despite repeated demands, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau have failed to return to Ms. Wei all but USD$34,000 of the funds that she provided to them.</P>
<P>8. Ms. Wei brings this application seeking an order that Ms. Lau be found in contempt for her breach of the terms of the Mareva Order and her willful refusal to attend her examination for discovery and an order striking Ms. Lau's response to civil claim. Ms. Wei also seeks an order for the disclosure of material documents from Mr. Chiu.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Procedural History</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Wei Obtains Mareva Order</EM></TI>
<P>9. Ms. Wei filed her notice of civil claim on May 12, 2017, claiming the sum of approximately $1.5 million on account of the amounts provided by Ms. Wei to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau. Ms. Wei also sought interim and permanent injunctive relief restraining the defendants from disposing of their assets, as well as equitable relief, including tracing orders and orders that the defendants hold any real and personal property as constructive trustees.</P>
<P>10. Humphries J. granted the Mareva Order on short notice to the defendants, prohibiting the defendants from disposing of their assets.</P>
<P>11. Paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order imposed the following restrictions on the defendants' spending:
<QUOTE><P>This Order does not prohibit the defendants from <UNDER>spending $3,500.00 each per month on ordinary living expenses</UNDER> and a total of $25,000.00 each on legal advice and representation. <UNDER>Before spending any money on living, business or legal expenses, the defendant must advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of the funds</UNDER>. (Emphasis added.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. The Mareva Order was emailed to each of the defendants on May 19, 2017.</P>
<P>13. The Mareva Order required the defendants to provide Ms. Wei's solicitor with an Asset List within seven days setting out all of the defendants' assets as of the date of the Mareva Order.</P>
<P>14. On December 4, 2018, Grauer J. varied the Mareva Order, with the consent of the defendants, to reduce the amount that Ms. Lau is permitted to spend each month on ordinary living expenses to $1,000 per month.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Defendants' Delay in Providing Document Discovery</EM></TI>
<P>15. Ms. Wei served her list of documents on October 23, 2017. Ms. Wei served an amended list of documents on November 9, 2017, listing additional documents.</P>
<P>16. Ms. Wei scheduled examinations for discovery of Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau in November 2017. Those examinations could not proceed, as the defendants had yet to deliver their list of documents, despite several requests. They were adjourned by agreement.</P>
<P>17. On May 29, 2018, Ms. Wei filed an application seeking an order that the defendants deliver a list of documents.</P>
<P>18. On June 6, 2018, Master Vos ordered that the defendants deliver a list of documents within 21 days.</P>
<P>19. On July 3, 2018, the defendants delivered a list of documents. Despite Ms. Wei requesting copies of the documents on July 5, 2018, the documents were not delivered until August.</P>
<P>20. By letter dated October 10, 2018, Ms. Wei made demand of the defendants pursuant to sub-rules 7-1(10) to (12) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> that the defendants' list of documents be amended to include additional documents, including the documents set out at <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this notice of application. Counsel for Ms. Wei left requests for the same at Mr. Chiu's examination for discovery on January 22, 2019.</P>
<P>21. On December 4, 2018, Grauer J. ordered Ms. Lau to produce bank and financial records from the accounts that the outlined in her Asset List.</P>
<P>22. Those records were delivered to Ms. Wei on December 17, 2018, and January 17, 2019.</P>
<P>23. Ms. Wei has yet to receive production of the bank and financial records of Mr. Chiu.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Lau Fails to Attend Scheduled Examination for Discovery on September 27, 2018</EM></TI>
<P>24. On September 19, 2018, Ms. Wei served an appointment to examine for discovery Ms. Lau on September 27, 2018, at the offices of her then counsel and attached conduct money.</P>
<P>25. On September 24, 2018, then counsel for the defendants advised that he was instructed that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to travel for medical reasons. Counsel for the defendants explained that he understood that Ms. Lau had a blood disorder, and it was hoped it would resolve sufficiently by December so that she would be able to travel then. Counsel for the defendants requested that the examination of Ms. Lau be rescheduled to December, as Ms. Lau was unable to attend the scheduled discovery on September 27, 2018.</P>
<P>26. On September 26, 2018, counsel for the defendants sent an email to counsel for Ms. Wei reiterating that Ms. Lau was not available for the reasons previously expressed.</P>
<P>27. Ms. Lau did not attend at her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27. A certificate of non-attendance was issued.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Lau was not in China on the Date of her Examination</EM></TI>
<P>28. The reason proffered by Ms. Lau's then-counsel on her behalf for her inability to attend her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27 was that she was in China and unable to travel to Vancouver for medical conditions. That was not true.</P>
<P>29. On September 24, the day Ms. Lau's counsel advised Ms. Wei's counsel that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to travel for medical reasons, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed by John Hilpert, a private investigator retained by Ms. Wei, at the McArthurGlen outlet mall in Richmond, British Columbia in a dark BMW vehicle.</P>
<P>30. During the afternoon of September 26, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed again by Mr. Hilpert at numerous locations in Vancouver, including playing tennis on the UBC campus, driving their BMW, walking a dog at a park and picking up their daughter at the Lansdowne Skytrain station. Mr. Hilpert observed that the BMW had an expired insurance sticker.</P>
<P>31. On September 27, the day of her scheduled examination, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were observed again by Mr. Hilpert at several locations in Vancouver.</P>
<P>32. On September 28, Ms. Lau and Mr. Chiu were again observed by Mr. Hilpert at several locations in Vancouver, including attending the CIBC branch located at 4489 West 10<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, playing tennis on the UBC campus and going to the McArthurGlen outlet mall in Richmond.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Further Attempts to Schedule Discoveries of the Defendants</EM></TI>
<P>33. As a result of those events, among others, Ms. Wei brought the application heard by Grauer J. on December 4, 2018. In response to that application, and the application for an order that Lau's response to civil to claim be struck, Ms. Lau swore an affidavit on December 4, 2018, in which she stated, at para. 11:
<QUOTE><P>I am able to attend an examination for discovery between the dates of December 18, 2018 to December 20, 2018 and will attend whether ordered, or in response to an appointment to examine for discovery.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. On December 11, 2018, Ms. Wei served an appointment to examine for discovery of Ms. Lau returnable on December 19, 2018. Ms. Lau did not attend at her scheduled examination for discovery on December 19, 2018. A certificate of non-attendance was issued. The following day, December 20, 2018, Lau's counsel delivered to Ms. Wei's counsel a doctor's note dated December 19, 2018, stating, in full:
<QUOTE><P>This is to confirm that Ms. Chiu is unable to attend her court appearance today for medical reasons. She will be unable to attend for the next four weeks for medical reasons.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>35. On January 4, 2019, Ms. Wei served an appointment to examine for discovery Ms. Lau on January 18, 2019 (being four weeks from the doctor's note of December 19, 2018).</P>
<P>36. Ms. Lau did not attend her scheduled examination for discovery on January 18. A certificate of non-attendance was issued. Late in the afternoon on January 17, 2019, Ms. Lau's lawyer delivered to Ms. Wei's lawyer a further doctor's note of that day stating, in full:
<QUOTE><P>Unable to attend court on 18<SUP>th</SUP> January due to sickness. Will remain unfit for court until the end of February 2019.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>37. The trial date is March 4, 2019.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Spending of Funds Contrary to the Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>38. The banking records produced in December 2018 pursuant to the order of Grauer J. revealed significant and consistent spending by Ms. Lau in excess of what the Mareva Order (both originally and as varied by Grauer J.) permits.</P>
<P>39. On September 7, 2017, Ms. Lau swore an affidavit in which she deposed:
<QUOTE><P>I only found out that the plaintiff had obtained a world-wide Mareva injunction against me and the first defendant (Allan Chiu) on or around May 25, 2017, i.e. after the first defendant's conference call with the lawyers in Canada.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>40. Accordingly, at least by May 25, 2017, Ms. Lau had knowledge of the Mareva Order. A few days later, on May 29, 2017, USD$154,000 was withdrawn from her CIBC US dollar account #XXXXXXXXXX at 5796 University Boulevard, Vancouver.</P>
<P>41. On January 9, 2019, Mr. Chiu was found in contempt of court for intentionally disobeying the Mareva Order by withdrawing amounts in breach of the Mareva Order after being served with a copy thereof.</P>
<P>42. Ms. Lau has breached the Mareva Order by spending in excess of the monthly amount permitted ($3,500 per month from May 2017 to November 2018, and $1,000 per month as of December 4, 2018) in at least May 2017, October 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2017, February 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, and December 2018. That spending is outlined in the table appended as <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Striking Ms. Chiu's Response to Civil Claim for Failure to Attend Examination</UNDER></TI>
<P>43. A party of record has an obligation to make him or herself available for an examination for discovery: Rule 7-2(1).</P>
<P>44. Where a defendant, contrary to the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> and without lawful excuse, neglects to attend at the time and place appointed for his or her examination for discovery, the court may strike out the response to civil claim and order the proceeding to continue against that person as if no response to civil claim had been filed: Rule 22-7(2) and (5).</P>
<P>45. Where the evidence is clear that a defendant has engaged in obstructive conduct, the court will be more willing to apply the sanction of striking the defence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Han v. Cho</SOC><CITE>2008 BCSC 1621</CITE><PARANUM>19&ndash;21</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Kalcsa v. Read Media Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 248</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>636023 B.C. Ltd. v. A-Millenia Construction Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2005 BCSC 1563</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>46. The facts of this case merit an order that Ms. Lau's response to civil claim be struck.</P>
<P>47. Ms. Lau's response to civil claim should be struck and the proceeding continued against her as if no response to civil claim had been filed.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Ms. Lau is in Contempt of Court</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Failure to Attend</EM></TI>
<P>48. Ms. Lau's failure to attend her scheduled examination for discovery and her non-compliance with paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order both constitute contempt of court.</P>
<P>49. Pursuant to Rule 22-8(4) of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, a person who is guilty of refusing, without lawful excuse, to attend at the time and place appointed for his or her examination for discovery is subject to the court's power to punish contempt of court.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Mareva Order</EM></TI>
<P>50. The Mareva Order limits the amounts Ms. Lau may spend on ordinary living expenses and requires that the defendants advise Ms. Wei's solicitors in writing of the intended source of funds for living expenses <UNDER>before</UNDER> any money is spent.</P>
<P>51. The financial records produced pursuant to the December 2018 Order, show that Ms. Lau has regularly spent more than the amounts permitted by the Mareva Order and the December 2018 Order. Ms. Lau spent more than $3,500 on ordinary living expenses in May 2017, October 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2017, February 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, and in excess of $1,000 in December 2018.</P>
<P>52. Expenditures made in these months include:
<P1>a. the transfer of USD$154,000 from her CIBC US Dollar Account XXXXXXXXXX on May 29, 2017;</P1>
<P1>b. monthly payments of $1,260.12&ndash;$1,289.59 to lease and insure a 2017 BMW X4 M40i, which lease Ms. Lau entered on September 9, 2017, after the Mareva Order;</P1>
<P1>c. purchases of $1,192.80 at Holt Renfrew on May 6, 2018 (as charged to her Hudson Bay Mastercard); and</P1>
<P1>d. purchases of $3,090.21 at Holt Renfrew, SSense, JCrew and Uniqlo in the month of June 2018 (as charged to her Hudson Bay MasterCard and Costco Platinum MasterCard).</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Analysis</EM></TI>
<P>53. On an application for contempt, the applicant must prove three elements, being a clear order, actual knowledge of the order, and evidence of wilful noncompliance.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Carey v. Laiken</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>30&ndash;35</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 2629</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF><BOLD>;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Unifor Local Union No. VCTA v. Sunlover Holding Co.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 922</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>54. Moreover, Ms. Lau has failed, contrary to the Mareva Order, to provide Ms. Wei's solicitors with advance notice in writing of the intended source of funds for living expenses since approximately December of 2017.</P>
<P>55. All of the elements of contempt are met in this case.</P>
<P>56. With respect to Ms. Lau's failure to comply with paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order, the evidence establishes that all three elements of a contempt finding are present. First, the order is clear that Ms. Lau must notify Ms. Wei's solicitors of the intended source of funds <UNDER>before</UNDER> spending any money on living, business or legal expenses and must spent within the limits that it sets. Second, it is clear that Ms. Lau had knowledge of the order, as Ms. Lau swore to such knowledge in her past affidavit and, through her counsel, previously provided Ms. Wei's solicitors with information concerning Ms. Lau's spending on living expenses. Third, Ms. Lau's failure to provide Ms. Wei's solicitors with the court ordered information before spending money and her excess of the limits set is willful conduct in contravention of the Mareva Order.
<P1><BOLD><EM>XY, LLC</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. With respect to Ms. Lau's refusal to attend her scheduled examination for discovery, Ms. Wei properly served her appointments to examine Ms. Lau in accordance with the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>. While the defendants' evidence is that Mr. Chui hid the scheduling of the first examination from Ms. Lau, the examinations since have been scheduled on notice to her or on dates of her suggestion. The reasons she has provided for failing to attend, including the doctor's notes provided excusing her due to &ldquo;sickness&rdquo;, are inadequate. That is particularly the case where she swore an affidavit stating that she would attend and where the most recent note claims that she is unable to attend until, effectively, the trial date. Those reasons being inadequate, Ms. Lau should be found to have willfully and deliberately failed to attend on at least two occasions, and she should be found in contempt of court for doing so.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Special Costs</UNDER></TI>
<P>58. A person found in contempt is normally ordered to pay special costs because a breach of a court order is <EM>prima facie</EM> conduct deserving of rebuke. Special costs otherwise operate to indemnify the party forced to bring an application to remedy the other party's contempt.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Production of Additional Documents</UNDER></TI>
<P><BOLD>59.</BOLD> Ms. Wei has demanded production of additional documents from the defendants. In particular, Ms. Wei has demanded production of all the defendants' bank and financial records from the period of June 1, 2015, to present.</P>
<P>60. Ms. Lau produced an Amended List of Documents addressing that demand pursuant to the December 2018 Order. Mr. Chiu has yet to do the same.</P>
<P><BOLD>61.</BOLD> The requested documents are capable of being used to prove or disprove material facts at issue in the proceeding. In particular, the documents are relevant to Ms. Wei's tracing claims against the defendants and are sought from the time that Ms. Wei first advanced funds to the present date. The documents are producible and should have been listed in the defendants' list of documents.

<P1>Affidavit #2 of Queenie Lau, at para. 8.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Allan Chiu, at para.5.</P1></P>
<P>5. On May 12, 2017, the Plaintiff filed the Notice of Civil Claim in this matter.</P>
<P>6. On May 14, 2017, unaware of the claim that had been filed by the plaintiff, Ms. Lau transferred $175,000USD to Mr Chiu's Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong.

<P>7. On May 16, 2017, unaware of the claim that had been filed by the plaintiff, Ms. Lau transferred $ 100,000USD to Mr Chiu's Bank of China (HK) account in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>8. On May 16, 2017, Master Scarth, on appearance by the plaintiff without notice to the defendants, made an order such that the plaintiff was at liberty to serve a copy of the Notice of Civil Claim by sub-service by leaving a copy of the Notice of Civil Claim and the Sub-Service Order at the defendants residence, by e-mailing the defendants, and by sending a We Chat message.</P>

<P1>Affidavit #2 of Queenie Lau, at paras. 9</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Ms. Lau was not in China</EM></TI>
<P>11. On September 27, 2018, Ms. Lau was scheduled to attend an appointment for an examination for discovery. Her counsel, at the time, had been advised by Mr Chiu that Ms. Lau had a blood disorder and was in China. That information was communicated to Mr Dennis, and it was not entirely accurate. It was true that Ms. Lau had a blood disorder. However, it was not true that she was in China, and Mr Chiu made that false claim because he was concerned about Ms. Lau's health and the stress that she would be subjected to in the examination for discovery.</P>
<P>12. Mr Chiu has admitted that it was his idea and he mistakenly did so in order to subject Ms. Lau to further stress that would aggregate her medical conditions. It was a mistake and factored into Mr Chiu being found in contempt of court.</P>
<P>13. Mr Chiu, out of consideration for Ms. Lau's health, never advised her of the September 27, 2018 examination for discovery, and, as a result Ms. Lau was unaware of her obligation to attend on that date.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 20</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Health Problems&mdash;Missed Examinations for Discovery</EM></TI>
<P>14. Ms. Lau has a number of serious health problems that have prevented her from being able to attend an Examination for Discovery. Plaintiff counsel was made aware of her medical condition on the following occasions:

<P2>(iii) uterine polyp; and</P2>
<P2>(iv) a severe iron deficiency requiring transfusion.</P2>
<P2>Affidavit #4 of Sarah Culver, at Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</P2></P1></P>
<P>15. On December 17, 2018, the Plaintiff was further advised that the upcoming examination for discovery would not be able to proceed due to the health issues suffered by Ms. Lau.
<P1>Affidavit #4 of Sarah Culver, at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</P1></P>

<P>20. Ms. Lau confirms that she has surgery scheduled for February 22, 2019, and she is not certain as to the recovery period for that surgery.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraphs 16 &amp; 18</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Spending of Funds</EM></TI>
<P>21. The financial documents demonstrate that Ms. Lau did not spend in excess of the monthly amount of $3,500, and the details of the alleged imputed transactions are detailed below:
<P1>(a) Regarding the May 20, 2017 transfer of funds to the Scotiabank Personal Line of Credit Acct. #XXXXXXXXXX Ms. Lau was entirely unaware at that time of the existence of a lawsuit against her or the Mareva Order. Further, the account was not a withdraw al but a deposit to Ms. Lau's Scotiabank Momentum Visa account.</P1>
<P1>(b) Regarding the May 29, 2017 transfer of funds into the account by &ldquo;CIBC WMIS&rdquo; in the amount of $154,000 and out of the account by a &ldquo;Preauthorized Debit&rdquo;, Ms. Lau advised that she was in Hong Kong at the time. Attempts have been made to ascertain the nature of the transaction. We understand the account was frozen at the time and may be a bank reconciliation.</P1>
<P1>(c) Regarding the June 8, 2017 transfer of funds from the CIBC US Dollar Account XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC US Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), plaintiff counsel and Bill Riley, counsel for Ms. Lau, arranged on her instructions for her share of $25,000 in legal fees to be paid from the CIBC Investor's Edge Account #XXXXXXXXXX (&ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC IE Account</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>(d) Regarding the June 28, 2017 transfer of funds from both the CIBC US Account and the CIBC Account #XXXXXXXXXX (&ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), Ms. Lau arranged through her counsel that $3,500, representing the amount she was permitted to use under the Order, to be applied to her TD Visa.</P1>
<P1>(e) Regarding the July 27, 2017 transfer of funds, as immediately above, Ms. Lau arranged through her counsel that the $3,500, representing the amount she was permitted to use under the Order be applied to her TD Visa. She was aware that the request was delivered but am unaware of whether the plaintiff provided authority for the use of funds.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 5</P1></P>
<P>22. In August 2017, Ms. Lau did not use any of the $3,500 permissible for living expenses.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 6</P1></P>

<P>24. In October 2017, the funds well below the $7,000 in funds that were permissible to be jointly used by Ms. Lau and Mr Chiu pursuant to the Order.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 9</P1></P>
<P>25. In November 2017, the total at Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; of the Notice of Application is incorrect. Schedule B has a total of $15,189.49. On review of the calculation and by adding the amounts listed, the total amount is $9,785.59.

<P>26. On November 6, 2017, the request for September living expenses was consented by the plaintiff. As such, of the $9,785.59 a total of $3,100.00 was withdrawn with consent of counsel. The remaining $6,685.59 was within the $7,000 permissible pursuant to the Order.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 11</P1></P>
<P>27. Between the months of November 2017 and December 2018, the calculations of San Chan show that neither Ms. Lau nor Mr Chiu used more than the permissible amount of $7,000 from any of our accounts.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 13</P1></P>
<P>28. Further, payments to the Scotiabank Personal Line of Credit were duplicated in some months and not charged in others. Double payments were made in the months of October 2017, January 2018, and October 2018. No payments were made in the months of November 2017, February 2018, and November 2018.
<P1>Affidavit #3 of Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, paragraph 14</P1></P>
<P>29. Regarding the production additional documents, Mr. Chiu has been diligent in attempting to secure documents requested by the bank. The delay is through no fault of the defendants and are being acquired.

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. The applicant has failed to prove that Ms. Lau intentionally disobeyed one or more terms of the order.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Absence of intention to disobey one or more terms of the order</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>2. The three part test is conjunctive and necessitates the applicant satisfy all three elements. At issue here is the third element. The applicant has not proven that the &ldquo;... alleged contemnor intentionally disobeyed one or more of the terms of the order.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>3. The third element of the test requires &ldquo;... proof of <BOLD><UNDER>deliberate</UNDER></BOLD> conduct that has the effect of contravening the court order.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>4. In assessing what is necessary for civil contempt, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has stated:
<QUOTE><P>... the conduct constituting disobedience of the court order must have been intentional, as opposed to accidental or unintentional, and with the fact that intention <EM>may</EM> be inferred from the circumstances...&lsquo;all that is necessary is proof of deliberate conduct that has the effect of contravening the order; an intent to bring the Court into disrepute or to interfere with the due course of justice or with the lawful process of the Court is not an essential element of civil contempt.&rsquo; (emphasis in the original)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>North Vancouver (District) v. Sorrenti</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 314</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF>., citing <CASEREF><SOC>Topgrow Greeenhouses Ltd. v. Houweling</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 355</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>5. Justice Fisher in <EM>CE International Resources</EM> stated that positive proof that disobedience was accidental or unintentional results in an unlikely conviction of contempt as stated::
<QUOTE><P>... the petitioner must show both conduct which was in breach of an order and that the conduct was intentional&mdash;although as has been seen, intention may be inferred from the circumstances of a given case. If the circumstances support such an inference, then in practical terms, t he defendant is likely to be convicted in the absence of positive proof that his or her disobedience of the order was in fact accidental or unintentional.</P>
<P><BOLD>Read par 24&mdash;(1) existence of the order&mdash;conceded (2) knew of the order and its terms&mdash;he did not (3) intentionally disobeyed requires proof of deliberate conduct&mdash;there is no such proof in this case</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Read par 25 &rarr; must be able to determine exactly what he is supposed to do &rarr; Mr Chiu was not able to do so as evidenced by believing there was a 7 day deadline to respond and texting the plaintiff advising her that he could no longer borrow money or pay her back</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>In an effort to understand the order he immediately makes efforts to retain Canadian counsel &rarr; that demonstrates good faith on his part to understand and be in compliance</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>CE International Resources Holdings LLC v. Sit</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 186</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>6. Deliberate as an adjective is defined as &ldquo;[i]ntentional; premeditated; fully considered.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM> (10th ed. 2014)</P1></P>
<P>7. Intentional as an adjective is defined as: &ldquo;[d]one with the aim of carrying out the act.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM> (10th ed. 2014)</P1></P>
<P>8. In response to the allegations that Ms. Lau intentionally missed dates for examinations for discovery, the medical evidence demonstrates that Ms. Lau was too ill to attend and Mr Dennis was provided with prompt responses and medical documentation. As such, Ms. Lau did not &ldquo;intentionally disobey&rdquo; the obligation to attend.</P>
<P>9. Intentional and deliberate acts necessitate premeditation and being fully considered. The applicant has failed to meet those requirements. The suggestion that Ms. Lau has been continually disregarding the court process is not substantiated. While it is true that Ms. Lau missed the September 27, 2018 examination for discovery, she has provided the explanation that she was unaware of the date and Mr Chiu took responsibility for that falsehood and confirmed he did not tell Ms. Lau of the obligation to attend on that date, because he was concerned for her well-being. Ms. Lau was either entirely unaware of the initial discovery scheduled for September 27, 2017 as a result of Mr. Chiu's decision to protect her from the stress of the discovery amidst health issues and her brother's failing health.</P>
<P>10. The information Mr. Chiu gave was false and he clarified and confirmed that during cross&mdash;examination that he was concerned about his wife's well-being and thought the discovery process would be too stressful for her.</P>
<P>11. His intentions in preventing his wife from going through more stress were good, but the manner that he went about it was wrong, and he understands that and has accepted full responsibility.</P>
<P>12. The allegations made in relation to breaching the Order are unfounded as the financial documentation and explanations provided by Ms. Lau account for the entirety of the alleged impugned transactions.</P>
<P>13. Additionally, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; relied on is complete with errors making the evidence impossible to reconcile. First, an approximate $6,000 error in Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; of the Notice of Application to have Ms. Lau found in contempt of court with respect to the total amount spent on November 2017 Second, for a number of purported transactions alleged to demonstrate the defendants have exceeded the limits under the order, the transactions were consented to by the Plaintiff. Third, a number of purported transactions reported as withdrawals from the account are actually deposits into the account. Specifically, we reference each of the Scotiabank Personal Line of Credit payments or deposits which were incorrectly reported as withdrawals which include:
<P1>(a) September 2017: deposits totalling $1,600 (page 367 of Chan Affidavit #1);</P1>
<P1>(b) October 2017: deposit totalling $300 (page 369 of Chan Affidavit #1);</P1>
<P1>(c) December 2017: deposit totalling $3 13.00 (page 371 of Chan Affidavit #1); The errors continue throughout the Scotiabank Personal Line of Credit records.</P1></P>
<P>14. Further, there are discrepancies contained in all credit card accounts as payments to the account are considered an example of spending without a corresponding transfer from an account.</P>
<P>15. The applicant is seeking an extraordinary remedy with quasi-criminal implications for Ms. Lau. Accordingly, the respondent has carefully reviewed each transaction and have provided complete explanations for each one.</P>
<P>16. Given the seriousness of breaching a court order, the test to be applied on this application is one of <EM>beyond a reasonable a reasonable doubt</EM>. A review of the medical records reveal that Ms. Lau is quite ill and is scheduled for surgery on February 22, 2019, which provides a reasonable explanation for the delay in having an examination for discovery. Moreover, the financial records demonstrate there has not been a breach of the Order.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the wife of the Co-Defendant Allan Chiu and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have persona! knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. The native language I speak is Cantonese. I have a basic grasp of the English language. The contents of this, my 3<SUP>rd</SUP> affidavit in this matter, were explained to my counsel and subsequently explained to me by my counsel with the assistance of Serene Chow, a Cantonese speaking lawyer at Boughton Law. Following the explanation, I advise that I understand the information contained in this affidavit as written in English.</P>
<P>3. As sworn in my affidavit #2 at paragraph 8, I confirm the truth of the statement that I travelled to Hong Kong on May 10, 2017 and returned to Vancouver on September 10, 2017.</P>
<P>4. As sworn in my affidavit #2 at paragraph 9, I confirm the truth of the statement that I first became aware of the lawsuit against me one or two days prior to a conference call with Jef Poulsen on May 25, 2017 at approximately 6:00 am HKT.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Financial Records</EM></TI>
<P>5. In response to paragraph 42 of the Notice of Application filed February 5, 2019 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Queenie Contempt Application</BOLD>&rdquo;), the plaintiff states that spending in excess of the monthly amount of $3,500 is outlined in appended Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;. I did not spend more than the allotted $3,500 per month and provide the specifics regarding the transactions as follows:
<P1>(a) Regarding the May 20, 2017 transfer of funds to the Scotiabank Personal Line of Credit Acct. #XXXXXXXXXX, I was entirely unaware at that time of the existence of a lawsuit against me or the Mareva Order. This was not a withdrawal of funds but was a payment made to my Scotiabank Momentum Visa.</P1>
<P1>(b) Regarding the May 29, 2017 transfer of funds into the account by &ldquo;CIBC WMIS&rdquo; in the amount of $154,000 and out of the account by a &ldquo;Preauthorized Debit&rdquo;, I advise that I was in Hong Kong at the time. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my Affidavit are boarding passes demonstrating that I was not in Canada at the time of the transaction.</P1>
<P1>(c) On February 12, 2019, I attempted to call CIBC at their toll free number at 1-800-465-2422 to ask CIBC about the nature of the transaction. I was advised that there is a &ldquo;restriction message&rdquo; and they could not disclose information. I have been advised and verily believe it to be true that my lawyer, Shaun Driver, has delivered an e-mail and attempted to call Sabrina DiGiacomo, CIBC Legal Department Law Clerk, to request particulars about the transactions.</P1>
<P1>(d) Regarding the June 8, 2017 transfer of funds from the CIBC US Dollar Account XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC US Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), plaintiff counsel and Bill Riley, counsel for me at the time, arranged on my instruction for my share of $25,000 in legal fees to be paid from the CIBC Investor's Edge Account #XXXXXXXXXX (&ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC IE Account</BOLD>&rdquo;). Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of correspondence as between counsel and the Litigation Clerk for CIBC regarding the transaction.</P1>
<P1>(e) Regarding the June 28, 2017 transfer of funds from both the CIBC US Account and the CIBC Account #XXXXXXXXXX (&ldquo;<BOLD>CIBC Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), I arranged through my counsel that $3,500. representing the amount I was permitted to use under the Order, to be applied to my TD Visa and CIBC USD Visa. The matter is referenced in Exhibit B.</P1>
<P1>(f) Regarding the July 27, 2017 transfer of funds, as immediately above, I requested through my counsel that the $3,500, representing the amount I was permitted to use under the Order be applied to my credit cards. I am aware that the request was referenced in an email by my counsel on June 27, 2017 as contained in Exhibit B but do not have access to records to confirm the authority was granted.</P1></P>
<P>6. In August 2017, I did not use any of the $3,500 permissible for living expenses.</P>
<P>7. Beginning September 2017, Mr. Chiu and I began to use the same BMO account for the purposes of our living expenses. Also, upon, our return, we changed counsel to Kieran Siddal.</P>
<P>8. In September 2017, my husband and I used $2,765 for living expenses permissible under the Order.</P>
<P>9. In October 2017, the funds are well below the $7,000 that was permissible to be jointly used by my husband and I pursuant to the Order.</P>
<P>10. In November 2017, the total at Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; of the Notice of Application is incorrect. Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; has a total of $15,189.49. On review of the calculation and by adding the amounts listed, the total amount is $9,785.59.</P>
<P>11. On or about November 6, 2017, $3,100.00 was deducted from by CIBC account (XXXXXXXXXX). These funds were requested by Kieran Siddal in letters dated November 3, 2017 to Scotiabank and CIBC for living expenses for the months of September and October 2017. I believe only CIBC responded to the request of our counsel and I only received living expenses of $3,100.00 for September 2017. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of correspondence of Kieran Siddal to the financial institutions.</P>
<P>12. For the months of Decembers 2017 to December 2018, the calculations of San Chanshowth at neither I nor my husband used more than the permissible amount of $7,000 from any of our accounts.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Health</EM></TI>
<P>13. <BOLD>I</BOLD> have reviewed Affidavit #4 of Sarah Culver dated February 12, 2019 and can advises that the letters dated by Dr. Leslie Zypchen of December 17, 2018, Dr. Monica Brunner of December 18, 2018, Dr. Deborah Hocking of December 19, 2018, and Dr. Caroline Diana Condon dated January 17, 2019 were provided to me following assessment and treatment by each doctor on the date of the letter.</P>
<P>14. I am still suffering from the symptoms as contained in the letters of my doctors. The fatigue, vertigo, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, palpitations, and difficulty hearing continue to bother me and that I agree with my doctors that despite my willingness to do so, I am unable to endure an examination for discovery.</P>
<P>15. I consider my personal health a private matter and consider it a violation of my privacy for the plaintiff to enquire about more specifics beyond those contained in the letters of my physicians.</P>
<P>16. I confirm that I have surgery on February 22, 2019. I am not certain as to the recovery period for that surgery.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Discovery</EM></TI>
<P>17. I have reviewed my affidavit #1 in this matter and confirm the facts sworn to remain true.</P>
<P>18. I was not aware of the Discovery scheduled on September 27, 2018 and was never personally advised of it.</P>
<P>19. I did state that I was available for discovery between the dates of December 18, 2018 and December 20, 2018 and would attended whether ordered or in response to the appointment.</P>
<P>20. Unfortunately, as is particularized in the letters above, my health deteriorated to the point I was unable to attend and has continued to plague me through to today's date.</P>
<P>21. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action filed February 5, 2019.</P>

<P>19. That said, Mr. Hilpert provided that he &ldquo;understood&rdquo; that &ldquo;Stoneset Asia Equities&rdquo;, which we assume was meant to be &ldquo;Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<BOLD>Stoneset Asia</BOLD>&rdquo;), was part of a group of Stoneset companies, which we assume meant there was an affiliation with &ldquo;Stoneset Equity Development Corp.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<BOLD>Stoneset Alberta</BOLD>&rdquo;). Mr. Hilpert refers to an unknown and unidentified private equity trade informant known as &ldquo;P.S.&rdquo; who reportedly had access to personal information to assist in identifying Mr. Chiu. The nature of that access is not defined nor is it provided. P.S. reportedly advised that Mr. Chiu had been involved, in an unknown capacity, in a major equities scandal in Calgary around 2011 involving a real estate scheme which proved to be a Ponzi scheme. Mr. Hilpert did not particularize the nature of the &ldquo;major equities&rdquo; scandal or real estate scheme that proved to be a Ponzi scheme, nor did he refer to evidence of the Ponzi scheme.
<P1>Hilbert #1 at paras. 15&ndash;20.</P1></P>
<P>20. Ms. Wei and Mr. Hilpert's speculative statements have no basis in fact. While Mr. Chiu operated Stoneset Asia until his retirement in 2010, the company was unrelated to Stoneset Alberta except that Mr. Chiu organized, for a fee, seminars for Stoneset Alberta in Asia. Mr. Chiu never worked for Stoneset Alberta in Calgary.
<P1>Chiu #2 at paras. 10-11</P1></P>
<P>21. Mr. Chiu was never involved in an equities scandal, real estate investment scheme, or Ponzi scheme with the Alberta company. Mr. Chiu ne ver invested nor induced others to invest in Stoneset Alberta. Further, no evidence was provided to demonstrate that Stoneset Alberta was ever investigated or charged in relation to a major equities scandal or Ponzi scheme.
<P1>Chiu #2 at para. 10&ndash;14</P1></P>
<P>22. Mr. Chiu does not know of anyone with the initials P.S. generally or specifically within the private equity trade or investment community in Alberta. As such, the purported source of the information is unreliable.
<P1>Chiu #2 at para. 15.</P1></P>
<P>23. Further, on a review of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 for Stoneset Alberta, as accessed from SEDAR, we note the following statements:
<P1>(a) Stoneset Alberta was created by an amalgamation on February 16, 2010 between Aqueous Capital Corp. and Stoneset Equities Ltd. (page 5);</P1>
<P1>(b) The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its subsidiaries, Stoneset Development Corporation, the general partner of Stoneset Del Lago Limited Partnership (&ldquo;SVDL LP&rdquo;), SVDL LP, Stoneset One Mortgage Corporation, Stoneset Development (Saskatchewan) Corporation, Stoneset Development (Invermere) Corporation and Stonesetgreen B.C. Development Corp (page 6).</P1>
<P1>Affidavit #2 of S. Culver at Exhibit G</P1></P>
<P>24. The above referenced document is a public document and has remained public at all material times in this matter. It was not presented to the Court and was not included in the affidavit of John Hilpert. The financial statements directly contrast his &ldquo;...understanding that [Stoneset Asia] is part of the Stoneset group of companies.&rdquo; Stoneset Asia is not noted by Stoneset Alberta as being a subsidiary. As Mr. Chiu clarified, it never was.</P>
<P>25. Mr. Hilpert deposed the following:
<QUOTE><P>I also conducted a search of Alberta Investors Protection's website and found an article entitled &ldquo;Calgary Investigation reveals Alberta Investors protection;&rdquo; which referred to Stoneset Equities. <BOLD>I cannot recall if the article was posted directly on Alberta Investors Protection's website or whether the website had a link to the article, but I printed out a copy of the article.</BOLD> Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to this affidavit is a copy of the article I printed out entitled &ldquo;Calgary Investigation reveals Alberta Investors protection; (sic)&rdquo; (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Hilbert #1 at para. 30.</P1></P>
<P>26. Alberta Investors Protection (&ldquo;<BOLD>AIP</BOLD>&rdquo;) is not a regulated website. The websites disclaimer identifies that it was formed to disseminate information with &ldquo;minimal restrictions as investors have been threatened with lawsuits for simply pursuing their rights. As such this website presents and open forum to seek out as much information as possible for the purpose of seeking the truth.&rdquo; Content on the site may be posted anonymously and is not tracked to the source. As such, the information contained on the site is inherently unreliable.</P>
<P>27. The article at Exhibit B of Mr. Hilpert's affidavit notes the source and posting of this site was done by a Ron Reinhold. Ron Reinhold operates a website called Rainbow Investigations at rainbowinvestigations.com. On searching the website, the article cited by Mr. Hilpert is found with distinct differences. First, at Exhibit B, we note that the font is different as between the content of the story on the top half of the page and the &ldquo;table of real estate trusts that have had trouble in Alberta&rdquo;. Second, and more importantly, the original document does not include the word &ldquo;[Asia]&rdquo; after Stoneset Equities. The word &ldquo;[Asia]&rdquo; is added after Stoneset Equities in Exhibit B. The addition of the word &ldquo;[Asia]&rdquo; is the only difference between Exhibit B and the original document.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>United Kingdom Properties in the Name of Mut Kwan Queenie Lan&mdash;(Para 21(f))</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>28. The Plaintiff deposed that Mr. Chiu advised her that Mrs. Chiu owned a townhouse in London's W8 district.
<P1>Wei #1 at para. 66.</P1></P>
<P>29. At all material times, neither Mr. Chiu nor Mrs. Chiu owned property anywhere in the world. This explains why the investigators were unable to find property owned by the Defendants. Further, Mr. Chiu did not advise the Plaintif f that either he or Mrs. Chiu owned property anywhere in the world.
<P1>Chiu #2 at para. 106.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Royal Bank&mdash;(Para. 21(g))</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>30. Mr. Hilpert deposed that he had sourced outstanding debt and a debt inquiry from the Royal Bank against Allan Chiu and adds that the Royal Bank has written of the debt as bad debt in 2014.
<P1>Hilbert #1 at para. 30.</P1></P>
<P>31. Mr. Hilpert does not include an exhibit with respect to his findings. Mr. Chiu is not aware of demands, claims, or litigation against himself anywhere by the Royal Bank of Canada.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Ocean Drive Property&mdash;(Para. 22)</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>32. Ms. Wei deposed that Mr. Chiu advised her that he had properties around the world and specifically a house and apartment in Singapore. The address for the home purportedly owned by Mr. Chiu is XXXXXXXXXX Further, Ms. Wei purports that Mr. Chiu signed a promissory note which reads &ldquo;I will use my house (located at XXXXXXXXXX as my pledge to gurantee (sic) the repayment.&rdquo; This fact that Mr. Chiu executed the promissory note is additionally relied on at paragraph 15 of the Not ice of Application.
<P1>Wei #1 at paras. 66, 73 and Exhibit V.</P1></P>
<P>33. Mr. Chiu never owned property in Singapore at XXXXXXXXXX Further, he did not tell the Plaintiff he owned the property. He did not sign the Promissory Note.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>British Virgin Islands Accounts&mdash;(Para. 23 &amp; 26&ndash;29)</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>34. In the Notice of Application, under the header of &ldquo;Dissipation of Assets&rdquo;, the Plaintiff asserts as fact at paragraphs 23 and 27 that Mr. Chiu &ldquo;...told [Wei] that for tax purposes he had used a number of companies put &ldquo;layers between himself and the properties he owned&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Notice of Application at para. 23</EM></P1></P>
<P>35. Further, in the Notice of Application, the fact relied on is that it was Mr. Chiu that recommended to the Plaintiff that she open a bank account in the BVI to hold her investments. Further, the Notice of Application relies on the purported statements of the Mr. Chiu regarding the &ldquo;layers between property owned by Mr. Chiu&rdquo; and the alleged recommendation by Mr. Chiu that the plaintiff use BVI accounts to hold investments which led to a &ldquo;real concern that [the Defendants] may transfer or hide assets...&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Notice of Application at para. 26&ndash;29</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>36. The Plaintiff deposed that at times on or around May 16, 2016 the Plaintiff was reluctant to invest in the UK and that subsequently funds were delivered after May 16, 2016 for the purpose of Mr. Chiu purchasing shares in the UK market on her behalf.
<P1>Chiu #2 at paras. 49, 53.</P1></P>
<P>37. Ms. Wei incorporated Century Lane Investment Ltd. in the British Virgin Islands on or about June 22, 2016.
<P1>Chiu #2 at paras. 91-92, and Exhibit D</P1></P>
<P>38. Ms. Wei deposed the following:
<QUOTE><P>At one point Mr. Chiu recommended that I open an account in the British Virgin Islands to hold all of my investments. I believe he may also have accounts there, or in other offshore locations.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Wei #1 at para. 80</P1></P>
<P>39. Ms. Wei subsequently clarifies in the affidavit that she retained the private investigator &ldquo;I-OnAsia Ltd.&rdquo; in or about the fall of 2016. It was then, on receiving information from the private investigator, that she asked Mr. Chiu about the Ocean Drive Property. She deposes that it was at that point that Mr. Chiu told her he had used lots of layers between himself and properties he owned and advised her she should own companies in the BVI.
<P1>Wei #1 at para. 88</P1></P>
<P>40. We are unable to reconcile how it came to be that Ms. Wei incorporated her business in the BVI on the recommendation or suggestion of Mr. Chiu in June 22, 2016 before she claims she received information from Mr. Chiu in the fall of 2016 advising her to own a BVI company.</P>
<P>41. In any event, Mr. Chiu does not have accounts or incorporated companies in the BVI and did not recommend BVI accounts. Rather, it was the Plaintiff who incorporated in the BVI on or about June 22, 2016 and delivered a text message on or about November 11, 2016 via WeChat requesting an appointment be set up to use the BVI account.
<P1>Chiu #1 at paras. 77, 83&ndash;85, 91, 95, 108, 151, Exhibit C</P1></P>
<P>42. Further, it is the Plaintiff's actions that warrant censure. The Plaintiff delivered messages to Mr. Chiu confirming that she was using underground banks in China to transfer funds out of China. It became clear to Mr. Chiu in early August 2016 that the use of the underground banks was because the source of the funds was questionable and the plaintiff was intending to avoid the attention of tax authorities. Further, the Plaintiff advised of her intention to transfer undeclared assets from China into a BVI Company.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Allan Chiu Consulting&mdash;(Hilbert Affidavit&mdash;Paras.25&ndash;28)</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>43. Mr. Hilpert deposed that Mr. Chiu held himself out as operating a business under the name Allan Chiu Consulting. Adding further, that he had discovered a website that had been operational and owned by Mr. Chiu with a URL of allanchiuconsulting.asia that was active until March 2016, a Hong Kong PO Box business address for Allan Chiu Consulting, and an address and phone number in Calgary that confirmed the URL was registered to Allan Chiu.
<P1>Hilbert #1 at paras. 25&ndash;28.</P1></P>
<P>44. No exhibits were provided to demonstrate the source of the facts contained in the above paragraph. Allan Chiu has used an e-mail address of allan@allanchiuconsulting.asia since approximately 2009. However, no website has operated using the name or URL of allanchiuconsulting.asia and no Post Office Box in Hong Kong has ever been used, as alleged, under the name of &ldquo;Allan Chiu Consulting&rdquo;. Allan Chiu has never operated or held himself to operate a business under the name of Allan Chiu Consulting.

<P>1. The court has an inherent discretionary jurisdiction to set aside or vary its own Orders.</P>
<P>2. In the <EM>ex parte</EM> application material non-disclosure occurred or, alternatively, material misrepresentations were made in seeking the Order such that the Order should be discharged, or alternatively, varied.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Material Non-Disclosure or Material Misrepresentation</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>3. Material non-disclosure arises where a party in an <EM>ex parte</EM> application fails to disclose a fact which may affect the outcome of the application. In a hearing to set aside a Mareva order, the court is to first consider whether there was material non-disclosure and, if not, is to proceed to a hearing <EM>de novo</EM> on the merits.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Northwestpharmacy.com Inc. v. Yates</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>4. Persons making an application <EM>ex parte</EM> must use the utmost good faith and, if they do not, they cannot keep the results of their application. Recently stated as an obligation that the applicant must be &ldquo;profoundly fair&rdquo; and disclose all important aspects of the evidence.

<P>5. Where a court finds material non-disclosure, it likely will, set aside the Mareva order. That said, the court retains discretion to consider whether the injunction should stand in light of additional evidence on the set-aside application.

<P>7. The principles surrounding full and frank and true disclosure and material misrepresentation were further particularized in <CASEREF><SOC>Bennet Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran</SOC></CASEREF> where the Ontario Superior Court of Justice said:
<QUOTE><P>(i) Material facts are those of which the court must be made aware in arriving at a decision, non-disclosure of which may have affected the court's approach to the motion, made the decision doubtful, or affected the outcome of the motion; ...</P>
<P><BOLD>(iii) In making full and frank disclosure of the relevant facts, the plaintiff must include facts which may explain the defendant's position, if known to the plaintiff.</BOLD> The onus on the plaintiff to make full and complete disclosure is not discharged by disclosing only what is the most limited basis of information that may be relevant. Full disclosure may and often will require a plaintiff to advise the court of matters of both fact and of law which form the position of the other side;</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>(vi) If a finding is made of material misrepresentation or material no n-disclosure the court is not stripped of all of its discretion but, generally speaking, the <EM>ex parte</EM> order will be set aside.</BOLD></P>

<P>8. In British Columbia, the Court of Appeal addressed the approach for Mareva Orders in Canada noting that the approach differs from other jurisdictions as a &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; or &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; approach. Under this approach, an applicant is required to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case and subsequently the focus of the application shifts to a balance of convenience.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kepis &amp; Pobe Financial Group Inc. v. Timins Corporation</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 420</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>9. Following an exhaustive review of the law, Justice D. Smith provided the following summary:
<QUOTE><P>In sum, British Columbia has forged a flexible approach to applications for Mareva injunctions from the more stringent rules -based approach in Aetna. Under this approach, &ldquo;[t]he fundamental question in each case is whether the granting of an injunction is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Mooney v. Orr No. 2</SOC></CASEREF> at para. 43. The legal test requires an applicant to establish:</P>
<P>(1) the threshold issue of a strong prima facie or good arguable case; and</P>
<P>(2) in balancing the interests of the parties, to consider all the relevant factors, including
<P1>(i) the existence of exigible assets by the defendant both inside and outside the jurisdiction, and</P1>
<P1>(ii) whether there is evidence of a real risk of disposal or dissipation of those assets that would impede the enforcement of any favourable judgment to the plaintiff.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Kepis &amp; Pobe Financial Group Inc.</EM>, at para. 18.</P1></P>
<P>10. At issue in this situation is whether the Plaintiff adequately satisfied the first part of the legal test above. The question that warrants asking is whether, had the Court received all of the relevant information, would the Plaintiff have demonstrated a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case?</P>
<P>11. In <EM>Mooney</EM>, the principles that underlie whether a strong <EM>prima facie</EM> case described challenges to the Court, whether on a contested application or an <EM>ex parte</EM> application as follows:
<P1>(a) it is difficult to summarize all relevant evidence given the limitations in time in presenting the case (paragraph 30);</P1>
<P1>(b) a conclusion on the strength of the case is made without findings as to credibility</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mooney v. Orr</SOC><CITE>[1994] B.C.J. No. 2652</CITE><PARANUM>31-32</PARANUM><COURTJUR>&ldquo;B.C.S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>12. Further, in <EM>Mooney</EM>, the Court proceeded to accept the following test:
<QUOTE><P><EM>In these circumstances, I consider the right course is to adopt the test of a good arguable case, in the sense of a case which is more than barely capable of serious argument, and yet not necessarily one which the judge believes to have a better than 50% chance of success</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mooney v. Orr</SOC><CITE>[1994] B.C.J. No. 2652</CITE><PARANUM>31-32</PARANUM><COURTJUR>&ldquo;B.C.S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> citing <CASEREF><SOC>Ninemia Maritime Corp. v.

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Variance to the Mareva Order</EM></TI>
<P>13. Alternatively, should the court refuse to discharge the Mareva Order, the Mareva Order should be varied to exclude a limit on the amount that may be paid for legal advice and representation.</P>
<P>14. Where the assets of defendants are frozen are shown not to be proprietary to the plaintiff, the defendants should be permitted to use those assets to obtain legal counsel as:
<QUOTE><P>[i]t would be shocking if a litigant could prevent an opponent in a lawsuit from defending himself by foreclosing his ability to retain counsel.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bot Construction (Ontario) Ltd. v. Dumoulin</SOC><CITE>[2008] O.J. No. 1861</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>90 O.R. (3d) 680</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>&ldquo;O.S.C.J.&rdquo;</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>15. The footnote to the model order reads:
<QUOTE><P>This Order is not intended to limit a defendant in obtaining legal advice. Whether an amount is fixed or reasonable, and the ultimate amount if it is fixed, should depend on the entire context of the case and the evidence: e.g., a more complex case may require higher legal fees.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. Further, where a &ldquo;white knight&rdquo; has been found to pay for legal fees, it should be of no consequence to the plaintiff as the funds do not detract from the funds on hand which is the concern of any Mareva injunction.

<P>I, Allan Chiu, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am aware that paragraph 4 of the Order of Justice Humphries pronounced May 18, 2017 restricts myself and my wife to a total of $25,000 each on legal advice and representation.</P>
<P>3. My wife and I have collectively paid $50,000 to the law firm of Poulsen &amp; Company who were the first law firm to represent us.</P>
<P>4. The law firm of Norton Rose who were the second law firm to represent us, through our previous lawyer Kieran E. Siddall, has advised us that they maintain an outstanding account of over $20,000.</P>
<P>5. At present, I am not current with my account at Boughton Law which, I have been advised, is becoming problematic given there is significantly more time required of counsel to prepare for the discovery of Rong Wei, trial preparation, and the trial of the matter.</P>
<P>6. Boughton Law, our current counsel, has advised us for adequate preparation and attendance for a seven day trial to begin on March 4, 2019 that legal fees are estimated to cost $100,000.</P>
<P>7. I require access to additional funds currently unavailable to me due to the Mareva Order in order to post the retainer that Boughton Law requires.</P>
<P>8. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action dated January 31, 2019 regarding discharge or variance of a Mareva Order.</P>

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Introduction</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The defendants have contemptuously breached the Mareva order that they now seek to set aside or vary, 21 months after its issuance. That is all the justification the Court requires for dismissing the application. The defendants dissipated assets (in the amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars) in defiance of a court order forbidding them from doing so. The defendants should not be given the ability to dissipate the remainder of the plaintiff's money in their hands.</P>
<P>2. The defendants admit to the receipt of substantial sums from the plaintiff. Mr. Chiu admitted on examination for discovery that he received funds from the plaintiff to invest on the plaintiff's behalf. He admitted that, at his direction, the plaintiff paid those funds to the defendant Queenie Lau and that the funds were deposited into a bank account belonging to Ms. Lau. He admitted that he owes money to the plaintiff. And he admitted that funds received from the plaintiff now are in his bank account in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>3. The evidence admitted to more than demonstrates a good arguable case. The defendants' spending of funds in breach of the Mareva order&mdash;for which Mr. Chiu already has been found in contempt of court and in relation to which an application to have Ms. Lau found in contempt of court is scheduled for hearing next Tuesday&mdash;shows a substantial risk of dissipation. If, as is the case, the defendants have dissipated assets with (and despite) a Mareva order in place, the court can and should have no hesitation in concluding that the balance of convenience favours maintaining the Mareva order.</P>
<P>4. Accordingly, the defendants' application to discharge or vary the May 18, 2017 Mareva order (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Mareva Order</BOLD>&rdquo;) should be refused for any or all of the following reasons:
<P1>(a) In accordance with settled law, the Court should decline to hear an application by the defendants unless and until the defendants purge their contempt. Both Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau have failed to comply with the Mareva Order. Mr. Chiu already has been found in contempt for contravening the Mareva Order, and Ms. Lau has a contempt hearing on February 19 based on spending in excess of what the Mareva Order permits.
<QUOTE><P>There is a well-settled rule that the court will not entertain an application by a person who is in contempt of court until he or she has purged him or herself of that contempt. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hadkinson v. Hadkinson</SOC><CITE>[1952] 2 All E.R. 567</CITE></CASEREF>, Lord Denning traced the origin of the rule in Chancery back to an ordinance of Lord Bacon in the year 1618, which laid down that &ldquo;they that are in contempt... are not to be heard [<EM>sic</EM>] neither in that suit, nor any other, except the court of special grace suspend the contempt&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bettinson v. Bettinson</SOC><CITE>[1965] 1 All E.R. 102</CITE><COURTJUR>Ch. Div.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, per Plowman J.</P1>
<P1>(b) The defendants' repeated breaches of the Mareva Order, by spending in excess of what the order of this court permitted, demonstrates a high risk of dissipation which justifies maintaining the Mareva Order; hundreds of thousands of dollars that were in the bank accounts of the defendants when this court granted the Mareva Order have vanished since.
<QUOTE><P>[T]he key requirement for any Mareva injunction ... is that it shall accord with the rationale upon which Mareva relief has been based in the past. That rationale, legitimate purpose and fundamental principle I have already stated, namely, that no court should permit a defendant to take action designed to frustrate subsequent orders of the court.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Derby &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4)</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 W.L.R. 412, 422</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1>
<P1>(c) The defendants belatedly, 21 months after the order was made, and only weeks before the current trial date, offer contradictory evidence, but that does not amount to non-disclosure; the application for the Mareva Order was on notice to the defendants (pursuant to an order for short leave and substitutional service); counsel drew to the attention of the experienced chambers judge that there was evidence from one side only.
<QUOTE><P>In these circumstances I conclude that this was not really a without notice application. Although the notice given was very short, notice was given, short leave was granted and, as I have indicated earlier, Eilat's counsel made submissions on the substantive application.</P>
<P><UNDER>In light of this. Eilat's submissions on Skeena's alleged failure to make full and frank disclosure, arguments that are more suited to cases where an order has been obtained truly without notice, have much less significance</UNDER>. I will, in any event, address those points shortly.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Skeena Resources Limited v Eilat Exploration Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 616</CITE><PARANUM>71-72</PARANUM></CASEREF>, per BlokJ.</P1>
<P1>(d) In any event, the hearing now is <EM>de novo</EM> and the evidence, including admissions made by the first defendant Allan Chiu on examination for discovery, more than meets the standard for the granting of a Mareva order: (1) the plaintiff has deposed that she entrusted funds to the defendants to invest on the plaintiff's behalf; (2) the defendants admit in their Response to Civil Claim the receipt of over $1 million from the plaintiff; (3) Mr. Chiu admits the funds were entrusted to him to invest on the plaintiff's behalf (save for US $200,000 which he claims was a loan); (4) Mr. Chiu admits that he owes money to the plaintiff; (5) Mr. Chiu admits that funds received from the plaintiff not already spent (some evidently to repay his gambling debts to loan sharks) now are in his bank account in Hong Kong; and (6) bank records of the defendants show that funds from the plaintiff were spent by the defendants on their own account, confirming the allegation of the plaintiff.
<QUOTE><P>The application is a hearing <EM>de novo</EM>. The court may consider new or additional material that is put forward as well as the evidence on the original application.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>In conclusion, the defendants' attempt to assert prejudice as a basis to set aside the <EM>Mareva</EM> Order overlooks their own conduct, their acknowledgment that money is owed and past due to the plaintiffs, and is defeated by their <EM>laches</EM>. The balance of convenience continues to weigh heavily in favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have established on this <EM>de novo</EM> application that the defendants are engaged in an effort to frustrate payment of monies justly owing to them.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Otal v Azure Foods Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1655</CITE><PARANUM>2 and 107</PARANUM></CASEREF>, per Walker J.</P1>
<P1>(e) The defendants' evidence falls short of what is required to justify a variation of the Mareva Order; the defendants by their own breaches of the order already have had access to hundreds of thousands of dollars, for which they need to account fully and with specificity before this court should permit further access to the frozen funds. Moreover, there is a higher test that the defendants must meet when they seek to access funds that the plaintiff says belong to her.

<P1>(f) Finally, even if the court were to discharge or vary the Mareva Order, the court should grant a preservation order over the funds in Mr. Chiu's Hong Kong bank account and order those funds to be paid into court, pursuant to Rule 10-1(1) and (2).
<QUOTE><P>The point of the proposed appeal is to cover the possibility that this court may set aside the <EM>Mareva</EM> injunction.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. This case concerns the actions of Mr. Chiu and his wife Queenie Lau, who between 2015 and 2016 received from the plaintiff, Rong (Eliza) Wei, approximately USD$1.1 million to invest on her behalf. As stated above, it is admitted that funds were received from the plaintiff for that purpose and that money is owed to the plaintiff.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Eliza Wei, paras. 16-17, 28-29, 39-40, 53-54, 57-58 and 62-63;</P1>

<P>6. Ms. Wei filed her Notice of Civil Claim on May 12, 2017 claiming the sum of approximately $1.5 million on account of the principal amounts provided by Ms. Wei to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau. On May 18, 2017, Humphries J. granted the Mareva Order, the terms of which provided that the defendants not in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned. Paragraph 4 of the Mareva Order imposed the following restrictions on the defendants' spending:
<QUOTE><P>This Order does not prohibit the defendants from spending $3,500.00 each per month on ordinary living expenses and a total of $25,000.00 each on legal advice and representation. Before spending any money on living, business or legal expenses, the defendant must advise the plaintiff's solicitors in writing of the intended source of the funds.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>7. On December 4, 2018, Mr. Justice Grauer varied the Mareva Order with the consent of the defendants, to reduce the amount that Ms. Lau is permitted to spend each month on ordinary living expenses to $1,000 per month.</P>
<P>8. The Mareva Order was not made <EM>ex parte</EM>, but rather was made on short notice pursuant to an order of Master Scarth made on May 16, 2017. The defendants were served with the application materials on May 16, 2017, which consisted of the Notice of Application for a Mareva injunction, two affidavits sworn by the plaintiff and one affidavit sworn by John Hilpert, a private investigator hired by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>9. Notwithstanding that the application was not <EM>ex parte</EM>, the plaintiff brought a number of additional considerations to the court's attention during the hearing of the application, including the following:
<P1>(a) The application relied mainly on evidence from the Plaintiff herself, and that the nature of the representations made by the Defendants, and the basis on which they received funds from her, was not corroborated by another witness.</P1>
<P1>(b) There was no evidence as to the whereabouts of the defendant Ms. Lau or that she could no longer be found at her residence. Accordingly, the court could not draw an inference that Ms. Lau had recently gone into hiding.</P1>
<P1>(c) Paragraphs 17&ndash;21 of Mr. Hilpert's affidavit contain hearsay evidence provided to Mr. Hilpert by a confidential informant that was not named. The evidence supported the order sought even if paragraphs 17&ndash;21 of Mr. Hilpert's affidavit were not relied upon.</P1>
<P1>(d) The plaintiff's first affidavit referred to information provided to her by private investigators in Asia. Her evidence of what those private investigators told her (at paragraphs 90 and 93 of her first affidavit) might be viewed as double hearsay (but was not relied on for its truth).</P1></P>
<P>10. On August 18, 2017, further to efforts to have the Mareva Order recognized and enforced in Hong Kong, the Plaintiff obtained an <EM>ex parte</EM> injunction and preservation order and <EM>ex parte</EM> disclosure order (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hong Kong Order</BOLD>&rdquo;), which provided, among other things, that the Mareva Order be enforced in Hong Kong and the Defendants not remove, dispose of or deal with their assets.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Defendants' Non-Compliance with the Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. On January 9, 2019, Madam Justice Baker found Mr. Chiu in contempt of court for contravening the Mareva Order. The sentencing portion of the application has not yet been heard. Mr. Chiu has not purged his contempt.</P>
<P>12. The defendants were served with the Mareva Order on May 20, 2017 (Hong Kong time) and shortly thereafter contacted counsel in Vancouver. Between May 20 to May 24, Mr. Chiu withdrew approximately HKD $1,678,959 from his HKD Account with Bank of China (the &ldquo;<BOLD>HKD Account</BOLD>&rdquo;) and USD $90,000 from his USD Account with Bank of China (the &ldquo;<BOLD>USD Account</BOLD>&rdquo;), totalling more than CAD $400,000 based on the Bank of Canada foreign exchange rate posted on February 12, 2019.</P>
<P>13. In the subsequent weeks and months, Mr. Chiu withdrew additional amounts from his USD Account and HKD Account in excess of the monthly living allowances under the Mareva Order. A summary of Mr. Chiu's withdrawals from May 20&mdash;August 4, 2017 is attached as <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Application Response.</P>
<P>14. On February 5, 2019, Ms. Wei filed a Notice of Application for an order that Ms. Lau be found in contempt of court for contravening paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Mareva Order. The application is scheduled for Tuesday, February 19, 2019.</P>
<P>15. The evidence filed in support of that application demonstrates that on May 29, 2017, after being served with the Mareva Orcler, USD$154,000 was withdrawn from Ms. Lau's CIBC US dollar account #XXXXXXXXXX at 5796 University Boulevard, Vancouver. The evidence also demonstrates that Ms. Lau has breached the Mareva Order by spending in excess of the monthly amount permitted ($3,500 per month from May 2017 to November 2018, and $1,000 per month as of December 4, 2018) in at least May 2017, October 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2017, February 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, and December 2018. That spending is outlined in the table appended as <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this Notice of Application.</P>
<P>16. Expenditures made in those months include:
<P1>(a) monthly payments of $1,260.12-$1,289.59 to lease and insure a 2017 BMW X4 M40i, which lease Ms. Lau entered on September 9, 2017, after the Mareva Order;</P1>
<P1>(b) purchases of $1,192.80 at Holt Renfrew on May 6, 2018 (as charged to her Hudson Bay Mastercard);</P1>
<P1>(c) purchases of $3,090.21 at Holt Renfrew, SSense, JCrew and Uniqlo in the month of June 2018 (as charged to her Hudson Bay MasterCard and Costco Platinum MasterCard).</P1></P>
<P>17. Ms. Wei's application also seeks an order that Ms. Lau be found in contempt of court for failing to attend her scheduled examination for discovery.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Court Ought Not Consider the Application until Defendants Purge their Contempt</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. As a general rule, courts will not hear further applications by persons in breach of a court order unless there is a convincing explanation given of the impossibility of compliance with the court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kwong v. Kwong</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 679</CITE><PARANUM>18&ndash;24</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>19. Contempt of court is an issue between a party and the court. It is not concerned with the merits of the dispute between parties to litigation, but rather strikes at the heart of the administration of justice. Court orders must be respected, even orders that the defendants consider were improperly or improvidently granted. The law is clear that an order of the court must be obeyed until it is reversed or varied.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Larkin v. Glase</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 321</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Sabourin and Sun Group of Companies v. Laiken</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 530</CITE><PARANUM>47</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>20. In <EM>Larkin</EM>, Mr. Justice Chiasson noted that there is clear authority for the Court of Appeal to refuse to hear an appeal where the order under appeal has not been obeyed. The refusal to hear an appeal is based on the policy of the court to protect the administration of justice by avoiding circumstances where the court could be held in disrepute by assisting a party who has exhibited disdain for the judicial process.
<P1><EM>Larkin</EM> at paras. 30&ndash;34</P1></P>
<P>21. Those principles&mdash;and the underlying rationale supporting them&mdash;apply similarly to applications brought by parties in breach of court orders in the Supreme Court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 2284</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>22. Mr. Chiu was recently found in contempt of court for breaching the Mareva Order and has not purged his contempt. Ms. Lau is similarly in breach of the Mareva Order and has a contempt motion scheduled for February 19, 2019. The court should decline to hear an application by the defendants until they have purged their contempt.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>There is No Basis to Set Aside the Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. An application to set aside a Mareva injunction is a hearing <EM>de novo</EM>. The court may consider new or additional material that is put forward as well as the evidence on the original application.
<P1><EM>Otal</EM> at para. 2</P1></P>
<P>24. Where a defendant asserts that a plaintiff has failed to disclose to the court material information, a plaintiff will not be held to have failed in its duty to make full and frank disclosure on the basis of &ldquo;mere imperfections in an affidavit or because inconsequential facts&rdquo; were not disclosed. In order for misrepresentations or omissions to result in an order being set aside, they &ldquo;must be relevant and material to the discretion to be exercised by the Court&rdquo;. A material fact is one that &ldquo;may or might affect the outcome of an application&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R&amp;D Arts inc. v. Feld</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 1896</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>25. An applicant on an <EM>ex parte</EM> chambers application is expected to present the factual matrix as it was able to see it, with the evidence available to it at the time.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Global Chinese Press Inc. v. Zhang</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 874</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>26. The legal principles pertaining to &ldquo;full and frank&rdquo; disclosure that apply on <EM>ex parte</EM> applications for a Mareva injunction have much less significance where the application is brought on short notice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Skeena Resources Limited v Eilat Exploration Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 616</CITE><PARANUM>71-72</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>27. The plaintiff's application for a Mareva injunction was brought on notice to the defendants. The defendants' arguments that the plaintiff failed to make full and frank disclosure in an <EM>ex parte</EM> application are thus irrelevant.</P>
<P>28. But even if the defendants' motion is considered on its merits, the defendants have not met their burden of establishing that the plaintiff did not make full and frank disclosure.</P>
<P>29. The defendants do not appear to be asserting that the plaintiff made any misrepresentations or omissions during the hearing. The defendants did not attend the hearing and have not included a transcript of the hearing in the record. The defendants have rather focused on the evidence filed in support of the application and effectively argue that the affiants, the plaintiff and Mr. Hilpert, omitted certain facts.</P>
<P>30. Most of the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that the defendants suggest were omitted were effectively the defendant Mr. Chiu's evidence that he did not make certain representations attributed to him by the plaintiff. Those cannot be &ldquo;misrepresentations&rdquo; or &ldquo;omissions&rdquo; in the context of an application for a Mareva injunction. The plaintiff asserts the representations were made; the defendant denies making them. Those are contested facts that will be adjudicated at trial.</P>
<P>31. The plaintiff, during submissions, drew to the attention of the court that the evidence filed in support of the application for a Mareva Order was the evidence of one side only.</P>
<P>32. The defendants also refer to several passages from Mr. Hilpert's affidavit that were on information and belief from unnamed informants. Once again, the plaintiff brought those matters to the court's attention during the hearing and explained why the identity of the informants was not disclosed.</P>
<P>33. The defendants have failed to articulate how any of the alleged &ldquo;misrepresentations&rdquo; from the hearing were material in the sense that they may have affected the outcome of the application. (And it is difficult to conceive how they could do so without the transcript of the hearing and the decision of Humphries J.).</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ms. Wei has a Strong Prima Facie Case</EM></TI>
<P>34. When the issue of granting the Mareva Order is considered <EM>de novo</EM> in light of the current evidence, the justification for continuing the Mareva Order is compelling.</P>
<P>35. Ms. Wei has provided evidence demonstrating that she provided significant funds to the defendants, and that those funds or any investments purchased by them were to be held in trust for Ms. Wei. With the exception of USD$34,000, the defendants have failed to repay the principal amounts advanced by Ms. Wei and have failed to transfer to Ms. Wei any investments held by them in trust for Ms. Wei.</P>
<P>36. The defendants admit in their Response to Civil Claim to receiving over $1 million from the plaintiff. Mr. Chiu admits that the funds were entrusted to him to invest on the plaintiff's behalf (save for US $200,000 which he claims was a loan), and that the funds were paid to Ms. Lau. Mr. Chiu admits that funds received from the plaintiff not already spent are in his bank account in Hong Kong. Bank records produced by the defendants show that funds from the plaintiff were spent by the defendants on their own account, confirming the allegation of the plaintiff. The evidence adduced by Ms. Wei on this application clearly establishes that she has a strong prima facie case.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Risk of Dissipation and Balance of Convenience</EM></TI>
<P>37. The court may infer risk of asset dissipation from the circumstances and the defendant's pattern of prior behaviour, especially where those circumstances and prior behaviour involve fraud or misrepresentation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>East Guardian v. Mazur</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 6403</CITE><PARANUM>67-68</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>38. There is a significant risk of dissipation in this case. Mr. Chiu already has been found in contempt of court for withdrawing funds in breach of the Mareva Order. Ms. Lau is similarly in breach of the Mareva Order, with a contempt hearing set for February 19, 2019.</P>
<P>39. Mr. Chiu has also sworn an affidavit admitting he lied to his former counsel, Kieran Siddall, that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to attend her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27, 2018. Ms. Lau was not in fact in China, but was in Vancouver, where both she and Mr. Chiu were observed by a private investigator in the days leading up to Ms. Lau's examination for discovery, as well as on the scheduled date itself. Mr. Chiu subsequently lied to his counsel that he was also in China and no longer resided in Vancouver.</P>
<P>40. The defendants' continual disregard for court orders and the court process demonstrate a genuine risk that they will do whatever they can to further dissipate or dispose of whatever funds or assets they currently have.</P>
<P>41. The balance of convenience in this case clearly favours Ms. Wei.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>There is No Basis to Vary the Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. The alternative relief sought by the defendants is to vary the Mareva Order to exclude a limit on the amount that may be paid for legal advice and representation.</P>
<P>43. The plaintiff in this case seeks both personal and proprietary relief. Ms. Wei is asserting a proprietary claim to funds and assets owned by the defendants as part of her claims for breach of trust, unjust enrichment and fraud. Ms. Wei seeks a declaration of constructive trust and seeks to follow the funds as well as trace into any substitute assets that may have been acquired by the defendants. That includes any funds held in Mr. Chiu's Bank of China account in Hong Kong, which Mr. Chiu suggested contained&mdash;and still contains&mdash;the plaintiffs' funds.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Foskett v. McKeown</SOC><CITE>[2001] 1 A.C. 102</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2000] 3 All ER 97</CITE><PAGENUM>at 119-120</PAGENUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>44. Where a defendant seeks to vary a Mareva order to access funds falling with a proprietary claim by the plaintiff, the defendant must meet a different and more demanding test.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Simon Fraser University v. Saidi</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 2287</CITE><PARANUM>5</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>45. The test was set out in the following terms by Mr. Justice Goepel in <CASEREF><SOC>Right Business Limited v. Affluent Public Limited</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 1541</CITE></CASEREF>:
<P1>(a) Has the defendant established on the evidence that he has no other assets available to pay his expenses other than those frozen by the injunction?</P1>
<P1>(b) If so, has the defendant shown on the evidence that there are assets caught by the injunction that are from a source other than the plaintiff, i.e. assets that are subject to a Mareva injunction, but not a proprietary claim?</P1>
<P1>(c) The defendant is entitled to the use of non-proprietary assets frozen by the Mareva injunction to pay his reasonable living expenses, debts and legal costs. Those assets must be exhausted before the defendant is entitled to look to the assets subject to the proprietary claim.</P1>
<P1>(d) If the defendant has met the previous three tests and still requires funds for legitimate living expenses and to fund his defence, the court must balance the competing interests of the plaintiff in not permitting the defendant to use the plaintiff's money for his own purposes and of the defendant in ensuring that he has a proper opportunity to present his defence before assets in his name are removed from him without a trial. In weighing the interests of the parties, it is relevant for the court to consider the strength of the plaintiff's case, as well as the extent to which the defendant has put forward an arguable case to rebut the plaintiff's claim</P1></P>
<P>46. The evidence of the defendants does not meet the test necessary to vary the Mareva Order. The defendants have not provided evidence of the intended source of funds to pay their legal fees. The defendants have also failed to account for the hundreds of thousands of dollars withdrawn from Mr. Chiu's Bank of China account in breach of the Mareva Order.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Order Sought</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. The plaintiff seeks an order that the defendants' application be dismissed, with costs payable to the plaintiff in any event of the cause.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>I, <BOLD>JOHN HILPERT</BOLD>, private investigator, of 547 - 1917 West 4<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a private investigator retained by the plaintiff, Rong Wei, and as such have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to in this affidavit except where stated to be on information and belief and in which case I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. As I have explained in my previous affidavits, I was hired by Ms. Wei in November 2016 to look into the defendant Allan Chiu to verify his identity and certain claims he had made to Ms. Wei regarding his past.</P>
<P>3. In my first affidavit made on May 12, 2017, I referred in connection with my investigation of Mr. Chiu to Stoneset Equities and the Stoneset group of companies.</P>
<P>4. A copy of Mr. Chiu's business card that I obtained during my investigation is doublesided. One side of Mr. Chiu's business card lists &ldquo;Stoneset Equities&rdquo; and contains a distinct corporate logo. Underneath the name &ldquo;Stoneset Equities&rdquo;, the business card lists Calgary, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Toronto, Singapore and Dubai. Singapore is identified in a Stoneset Equities promotional video published in September 2010 for a property referred to as &ldquo;Vista Del Lago&rdquo; located in Invermere, British Columbia that can be accessed on youtube at the following address: <UNDER>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmAdd3AkDis</UNDER>.</P>
<P>5. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a screenshot of the 1.57 minute mark of the promotional video, which is a map identifying Singapore and the location of Vista Del Lago.</P>
<P>6. On the other side of the business card is Mr. Chiu's name, identified as a Director of Stoneset Equities Asia Pte. Ltd. and provides an address in Singapore, an email with the domain &ldquo;@stoneesetequities.com.sg&rdquo; and a reference to a website with the following web domain: stonesetequities.com.sg. During my investigation, I researched the historical website page identified on Mr. Chiu's business card and learned it was not registered as its own URL. Instead, the web address would take a person directly to the Stoneset website.</P>
<P>7. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a copy of Mr. Chiu's business card.</P>
<P>8. The corporate logo located on the front side of Mr. Chiu's business card, as well as an image of a tree being reflected off a glass building on the second side of Mr. Chiu's business card, are both images that appear on a Stoneset brochure published in 2010-2011. Pages 4-5 of the brochure identify a location in Calgary as the &ldquo;Stoneset Head Office&rdquo;.</P>
<P>9. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to my affidavit is a copy of the brochure.</P>
<P>10. I am aware that a question has arisen about the document attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to my first affidavit and, in particular, the listing on that document of Stoneset [Asia]. As part of my investigation I visited the Alberta Investors Protection website on a number of occasions and reprinted the article including the referenced list more than once. I made annotations on one or more print-outs as my investigation proceeded. Looking back now, some two years later, I believe that the wrong document was attached to my affidavit.</P>
<P>11. What appears as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; was a reference tool for me as I investigated the name association involving Stoneset, Stoneset Asia and Mr. Chiu. That reference tool appears to have been left in play as the exhibit, which I did not notice at the time I swore the affidavit. That was inadvertent on my part.</P>
<P>12. The document referenced in my affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; looked similar enough to the other webpages printed that list Stoneset Equities that I did not notice it was not from the website. For instance, a copy of the list naming &ldquo;Stoneset Equities&rdquo; from the Alberta Investor Protection website was included as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; to my first affidavit.</P>

<P>I, Allan Chiu, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. At paragraph 87 of Affidavit of Rong Wei #1, Ms. Wei stated that I gave her a business card in November 2016. I did not give Ms. Wei the business card and am unaware as to how it came into her possession. As already has been stated in previous affidavits, I was retired from all business as of 2010.</P>
<P>3. At paragraphs 14&ndash;20 of Affidavit of Rong Wei #1, the Plaintiff stated that funds had been provided to purchase a TRU IPO shares. While the Plaintiff and I had discussions about the TRU IPO shares, they could not be purchased using the Wood Gundy trading account, which subsequently became CIBC Investor's Edge. The Plaintiff was aware of this. Ms. Wei did not provide any instructions to me at any time to purchase TRU IPO shares, or any shares excepting those regularly traded through the plaintiff's trading accounts.</P>
<P>4. At paragraphs 25&ndash;36 of Affidavit of Rong Wei #1, the Plaintiff stated that funds had been provided for the purchase of RACE IPO shares. Ms. Wei did not provide any instruction to me at any time to purchase RACE IPO shares, or any shares excepting those regularly traded through the plaintiff's trading accounts.</P>
<P>5. At paragraphs 37&ndash;45 of Affidavit of Rong Wei #1, the Plaintiff stated that funds had been provided for investment in Airbnb. Ms. Wei did not provide any instruction to me at any time to invest in Airbnb, or any shares excepting those regularly traded through the plaintiff's trading accounts.</P>
<P>6. At paragraphs 47-48 of Affidavit of Rong Wei #1, Ms. Wei states that she provided funds for investment in the UK Equities market. Ms. Wei provided funds generally for the purpose of potential investments in Europe which may include UK Investments but the funds were not particularized for UK Equities. The pattern of the Plaintiff was to deposit funds but not give instructions as to what was to be done with the funds. Additionally, the plaintiff references at Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo; a document purporting to be a summary that I provided. Ms. Wei did not provide any instruction to me at any time to invest in UK Equities, or any shares excepting those regularly traded through the plaintiff's trading accounts. As I deposed previously, I did not create and had not seen the document until seeing the document in the affidavit of Ms. Wei. I reference the statement of a UK Equities Portfolio Value as contained at Exhibit S, as it is my understanding that UK Equities cannot be traded in the CIBC Investor's Edge account.</P>

<P>I, Allan Chiu, presently with no permanent address but with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am aware of the Order of Justice Humphries of May 18, 2017 in which paragraph 4 prohibits my wife and I from spending more than $25,000 each for legal fees and further that my wife and I are to advise the plaintiff in writing of the intended source of t he funds.</P>
<P>3. We have brought an application that alleges the Mareva Order was attained by the plaintiff through misrepresentation and material non-disclosure.</P>
<P>4. I can advise that my wife and I have funds owing with my current counsel and previous counsel, Kieran Siddall, for legal services and have not been able to satisfy those accounts.</P>
<P>5. I have been advised and verily believe it to be true that Mr. Driver, and my previous counsel Mr. Siddal, have advised the plaintiff through her counsel of the existence of a &ldquo;white knight&rdquo; who has provided funds, and has capacity, to provide further funds. However, I have instructed my counsel not to provide the white knight's name to anyone.</P>
<P>6. I am aware the Plaintiff has retained private investigators to surveil my wife and I between the dates of November 2016 to the present in Canada. I am also aware of private investigators being retained by the plaintiff in Singapore and Hong Kong. I am concerned of private investigators following and sureveilling the &ldquo;white knight&rdquo; and do not wish to subject that individual to the level of scrutiny both I and my wife have endured.</P>
<P>7. As such, I do not wish to identify the &ldquo;white knight&rdquo; who is providing their personal funds to defend this matter. The &ldquo;white knight&rdquo; does not reside in Canada.</P>
<P>8. We started to receive funds from the white knight on or about August, 2017 as a result of all funds being frozen. Since September, 2017, funds received from the white knight have been deposited into my wife's Bank of Montreal account.</P>
<P>9. At times, when I was unable to receive funds from the white knight, I would remove funds from my Standard Chartered Account in Singapore and deposit funds in my wife's Bank of Montreal account.</P>
<P>10. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit is an email chain initiated by CIBC on November 3, 2017 in response to a letter of my former counsel regarding the release of $3,500 from my wife's CIBC account and the confirmation from plaintiff counsel that the release of funds was not a violation of the Mareva order.</P>
<P>11. I swear this affidavit in response to the Notice of Application of the plaintiff in the above referenced action dated January 31, 2019 regarding discharge or variance of a Mareva Order.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>NOTICE OF APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>Name of applicant: Rong (Eliza) Wei</P>
<P>TO: Mui Kwan Queenie Lau also known as Mut Kwan Queenie Chiu and Allan Chiu</P>
<P>AND TO: Their Solicitors</P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge at the courthouse at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia on February 14, 2019, at 9:45 a.m. for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. An order for the preservation of all funds held in Account Nos. XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX at Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Funds</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. An order that the defendant Allan Chiu forthwith pay the Funds into court.</P>
<P>3. Costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. This case concerns the actions of Allan Chiu and his wife Queenie Lau, who between 2015 and 2016 received from the plaintiff, Rong (Eliza) Wei, approximately USD$1.1 million to invest on her behalf.</P>
<P>2. Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau did not invest the funds they received from Ms. Wei and did not provide Ms. Wei a return on her investment. Instead, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau converted Ms. Wei's funds to their own uses. Despite repeated demands, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau have failed to return to Ms. Wei all but USD$34,000 of the funds that she provided to them.</P>
<P>3. On May 18, 2017, Madam Justice Humphries granted a Mareva injunction against the defendants (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Mareva Order</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. On June 21, 2017, Mr. Chiu swore an affidavit verifying his assets in accordance with the Mareva Order (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Chiu Asset List</BOLD>&rdquo;). Mr. Chiu swore that that he held two accounts with Bank of China in Hong Kong. Mr. Chiu swore that he held HKD2,212.88 in Account No. XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>HKD Account</BOLD>&rdquo;) and USD362,934.60 in Account No. XXXXXXXXXX (the &ldquo;<BOLD>USD Account</BOLD>&rdquo;) as of the date of the Mareva Order.</P>
<P>5. On January 22, 2019, Mr. Chiu was examined for discovery. Mr. Chiu gave evidence that he believed over USD400,000 received from Ms. Wei and deposited into Ms. Lau's account were transferred by Ms. Lau to Mr. Chiu's accounts at Bank of China in 2017.</P>
<P>6. Although Mr. Chiu subsequently withdrew large portions of Ms. Wei's funds from his accounts in Hong Kong (for which he has been found in contempt), there appears to be approximately $108,000 of Ms. Wei's funds remaining as of August 18, 2017 (the latest date for which Ms. Wei has evidence from Mr. Chiu).</P>
<P>7. Ms. Wei brings this application pursuant to Rule 10-1 of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> to preserve those funds by having the funds paid into court pending trial, currently scheduled to commence on March 4, 2019.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Mareva Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. Ms. Wei filed her Notice of Civil Claim on May 12, 2017 claiming the sum of approximately $1.5 million on account of the principal amounts provided by Ms. Wei to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau. Ms. Wei also sought interim and permanent injunctive relief restraining the defendants from disposing of their assets, as well as equitable relief, including tracing orders and orders that the defendants hold any real and personal property as constructive trustees.</P>
<P>9. On May 18, 2017, Humphries J. granted the Mareva Order, the terms of which provided that the Defendants not in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or outside British Columbia whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned.</P>
<P>10. On August 18, 2017, further to efforts to have the Mareva Order recognized and enforced in Hong Kong, the Plaintiff obtained an <EM>ex parte</EM> injunction and preservation order and <EM>ex parte</EM> disclosure order (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hong Kong Order</BOLD>&rdquo;), which provided, among other things, that the Mareva Order be enforced in Hong Kong and the Defendants not remove, dispose of or deal with their assets.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Contempt Motion</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. On December 5, 2018, Ms. Wei filed an application for an order that Mr. Chiu be held in contempt of court for contravening the Mareva Order by withdrawing funds from his account at Bank of China after being served with the Mareva Order.</P>
<P>12. Mr. Chiu made an affidavit in response to Ms. Wei's Notice of Application on December 12, 2018. Mr. Chiu gave the following evidence:
<P1>(a) By the spring of 2017, Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau were having marital difficulties. In or around March 2017, Ms. Lau advised Mr. Chiu that she was going to transfer all funds that were held in her CIBC account that were related to the plaintiff to Mr. Chiu's accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong (paras. 2-3);</P1>
<P1>(b) As a result, in April and May 2017, Mr. Chiu received four transfers totalling USD445,000 from Ms. Lau's CIBC accounts into his accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong (para. 4);</P1>
<P1>(c) On May 10, 2017, Mr. Chiu travelled to Hong Kong with Ms. Lau (para. 5);</P1>
<P1>(d) Between May 16&ndash;23, 2017, Mr. Chiu transferred USD169,000 from his Standard Chartered Account in Singapore to his HKD Account (para. 6);</P1>
<P1>(e) Mr. Chiu needed to transfer the funds from Singapore to Hong Kong to settle gambling debts with loan sharks (para. 7);</P1>
<P1>(f) Between May 19, 2017 to July 31, 2017, the balance in Mr. Chiu's USD Account decreased by approximately USD300,000, going from USD362,934.60 (as set out in the Chiu Asset List) to USD67,483.60 (paras. 10-11); and</P1>
<P1>(g) Between May 19, 2017 to August 10, 2017, the balance in Mr. Chiu's HKD Account went from HKD2,212.88 (as set out in the Chiu Asset List) to HKD76,099.89. The amounts in the HKD Account included several transfers of funds from Mr. Chiu's USD Account (paras. 12-13).</P1></P>
<P>13. On January 9, 2019, Madam Justice Baker held Mr. Chiu in contempt for contravening the Mareva Order. The sentencing portion of the application has not yet been heard.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Examination for Discovery of Mr. Chiu</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. On January 22, 2019, Mr. Chiu was examined for discovery by counsel for Ms. Wei. During his examination, Mr. Chiu gave the following evidence that is material to this application:
<P1>(a) Mr. Chiu does not have any assets that are not listed in the Chiu Asset List (Q74, p. 12).</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Chiu owes Ms. Wei money (Q333&ndash;336, p, 67).</P1>
<P1>(c) Ms. Wei made several transfers of funds to Ms. Lau at Mr. Chiu's direction deposited into an account held by Ms. Lau at CIBC, of which more than USD400,000 was probably transferred to his Bank of China account in Hong Kong (Q395&ndash;400, p. 61; Q408&ndash;411, p. 83; Q464-465, p. 95; Q480&ndash;488, pp. 98-99; Q492, p. 99; Q494-495, pp. 100-101; Q498&ndash;500, p. 101; Q516&ndash;526, pp. 105-106; Q585-586, p. 120; Q594&ndash;597, p. 121; Q632, pp. 127-128; Q636-637, p. 128; Q659&ndash;665, pp. 132-133; Q670-671, p. 134; Q683, p. 137; Q687-688, p. 138; Q691-692, p. 139).</P1></P>
<P>15. Ms. Wei does not have evidence of the current balances in Mr. Chiu's Bank of China accounts, as Mr. Chiu has not produced his bank records indicating the present balances in his accounts. Ms. Wei is seeking production of up-to-date banking records from Mr. Chiu in an application scheduled for February 19, 2019. However, based on an affidavit sworn by Mr. Chiu in Hong Kong on September 7, 2017, Mr. Chiu, as of August 18, 2017, appears to have had HDK118,000 in his HKD Account and USD67,000 in his USD Account. Those amounts translate to approximately $108,000, based on the Bank of Canada daily exchange rates for February 12, 2019. Ms. Wei is asserting a proprietary claim to those funds as part of her claim for breach of trust.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>16. The court may grant a preservation order pursuant to Rule 10-1 of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, s. 39 of the <EM>Law and Equity Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 253 and its inherent jurisdiction.</P>
<P>17. Rule 10-1 provides in relevant part:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>The court may make an order for the detention, custody or preservation of any property that is the subject matter of a proceeding or as to which a question may arise and, for the purpose of enabling an order under this rule to be carried out, the court may authorize a person to enter on any land or building.</SSECP></SSEC>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>If the right of a party to a specific fund is in dispute in a proceeding, the court may order the fund to be paid into court or otherwise secured.</SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The test for a preservation order requires the court to consider the following:
<P1>a. The plaintiff has a proprietary interest in the property that is the subject of the application;</P1>
<P1>b. The plaintiff reasonably believes the property is imperiled;</P1>
<P1>c. There is a substantial question to be tried as to the applicant's entitlement to all the property; and</P1>
<P1>d. The balance of convenience favours granting a preservation order.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McKnight v. Hutchison</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 36</CITE><PARANUM>146</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Drozdzik v. O'Nions</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1181</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>19. Alternate phrasings of the test adopted in some cases are no different in substance.
<CASEREF><SOC>Tran v. 2506448 Ontario Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1163</CITE><PARANUM>44&ndash;51</PARANUM></CASEREF></P>
<P>20. With respect to Rule 10-1(2), a specific fund is one to which the plaintiff shows fact that, if proven at trial, would give it a right of property in the fund. The property claims must be &ldquo;sufficiently ascertainable&rdquo;. The property claims can be to a beneficial interest in the fund.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kongrecki v. Rafael</SOC><YEAR>1993</YEAR><CITE>81 B.C.L.R. (2d) 387</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1993] B.C.J.

<P>21. Where funds are transferred or used to purchase other property, tracing is available provided the path of the specific fund is clear.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gold Star Renovations Inc. v. Vinnik</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 6575</CITE><PARANUM>21&ndash;28</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Drucker, Inc. v. Hong</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 905</CITE><PARANUM>36&ndash;39</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>22. The evidence filed in support of this application satisfies each element of the test.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Ms. Wei has a proprietary interest in the property at issue</EM></TI>
<P>23. It is clear from Mr. Chiu's evidence on examination for discovery, as well as in his previously filed affidavit evidence, that funds received by Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau from Ms. Wei were transferred from Ms. Lau's CIBC account to Mr. Chiu's accounts with Bank of China in Hong Kong. Based on Mr. Chiu's evidence, and assuming Mr. Chiu complied with the Mareva Order after August 2017, there would appear to be approximately $108,000 of Ms. Wei's funds sitting in Mr. Chiu's USD Account and HKD Account at the Bank of China in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>24. Ms. Wei is asserting a proprietary claim to those funds as part of this action, which includes claims for breach of trust, unjust enrichment and fraud for failing to hold her funds in trust and invest them on her behalf. Ms. Wei seeks a declaration of constructive trust and seeks to follow the funds as well as trace into any substitute assets that may have been acquired by the defendants.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Foskett v. McKeown</SOC><CITE>[2001] 1 A.C. 102</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2000] 3 All ER 97</CITE><PAGENUM>at 119-120</PAGENUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>25. Mr. Chiu's evidence provides a direct link between the funds transferred by Ms. Wei to Ms. Lau at his direction to the funds in his Bank of China account in Hong Kong. Ms. Wei, if successful in her claim, will be entitled to the return of her funds as a remedy for breach of trust. The first element of the test is satisfied.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Risk of Dissipation</EM></TI>
<P>26. The court may infer risk of asset dissipation from the circumstances and the defendant's pattern of prior behaviour, especially where those circumstances and prior behaviour involve fraud or misrepresentation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>East Guardian v. Mazur</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 6403</CITE><PARANUM>67-68</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>27. There is a risk of dissipation in this case. Although the funds at issue are theoretically frozen by the Mareva Order, Mr. Chiu already has been found in contempt of that order for withdrawing funds in breach of the Mareva Order. Mr. Chiu has yet to purge his contempt.</P>
<P>28. Mr. Chiu has also sworn an affidavit admitting he lied to his former counsel, Kieran Siddall, that Ms. Lau was in China and unable to attend her scheduled examination for discovery on September 27, 2018. Ms. Lau was not in fact in China, but was in Vancouver, where both she and Mr. Chiu were observed by a private investigator in the days leading up to Ms. Lau's examination for discovery, as well as on the scheduled date itself. Mr. Chiu subsequently lied to his counsel that he was also in China and no longer resided in Vancouver.</P>
<P>29. Mr. Chiu's continual disregard for court orders and the court process demonstrate a genuine risk that Mr. Chiu will do whatever he can to further dissipate or dispose of the funds currently held in the HKD Account and the USD Account.</P>
<P>30. In addition, the Defendants have applied, on one day's notice, for an order discharging the Mareva Order currently scheduled to be heard on February 14, 2019. Ms. Wei will be opposing that application. But in the event the Defendants are successful in discharging the Mareva Order, a preservation order is essential to ensuring the integrity of the Funds pending trial.

<BLOCK3><TI><EM>There is a Substantial Question to be Tried</EM></TI>
<P>31. This part of the test has been held to have a relatively low threshold for success. The court need not dwell too long on the evidence, nor should it measure the application by the likelihood of the applicant's eventual success at trial. The plaintiff is not required to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case.
<P1><EM>Kabani</EM> at para. 39; <EM>Kashani</EM> at para. 51</P1></P>
<P>32. Ms. Wei has provided evidence demonstrating that she provided significant funds to the defendants, and that those funds or any investments purchased by them were to be held in trust for Ms. Wei. With the exception of USD$34,000, the defendants have failed to re-pay the principal amounts advanced by Ms. Wei and have failed to transfer to Ms. Wei any investments held by them in trust for Ms. Wei.</P>
<P>33. Mr. Chiu, during his examination for discovery, admitted that he owes money to Ms. Wei. The evidence adduced by Ms. Wei on this application clearly establishes that there is a substantial question to be tried in this case.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Balance of Convenience Favours Granting the Order Sought</EM></TI>
<P>34. In <CASEREF><SOC>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. CKPG Television Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>64 B.C.L.R. (2d) 96</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1992] B.C.J. No. 247</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 5</PAGENUM></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Mr. Justice Lambert set out a list of factors to be considered in assessing the balance of convenience. Lambert J.A. noted that the list is not exhaustive, and the relevant factors will vary from case to case:
<P1>(a) the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the applicant if the injunction is not granted and for the respondent if an injunction is granted;</P1>
<P1>(b) the likelihood that if damages are finally awarded they will be paid;</P1>
<P1>(c) the preservation of contested property;</P1>
<P1>(d) other factors affecting whether harm from the granting or refusal of the injunction would be irreparable;</P1>
<P1>(e) which of the parties has acted to alter the balance of their relationship and so affect the status quo;</P1>
<P1>(f) the strength of the applicant's case;</P1>
<P1>(g) any factors affecting the public interest; and</P1>
<P1>(h) any other factors affecting the balance of justice and convenience.</P1></P>
<P>35. With respect to (a) through (d), Mr. Chiu's evidence at his examination for discovery was that he has no assets other than the assets listed in the Chiu Asset List. It thus appears that Mr. Chiu has no assets of any tangible value in British Columbia, or anywhere in Canada, that would be available to satisfy a judgment. Moreover, Hong Kong is not a reciprocating jurisdiction under the <EM>Court Order Enforcement Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 78, s. 37. A preservation order in the form sought by Ms. Wei is necessary to ensure the funds in Mr. Chiu's HKD Account and USD Account with Bank of China in Hong Kong to which Ms. Wei asserts a propriety claim are preserved until trial.</P>
<P>36. With respect to (e), it is the Defendants that have altered the status quo by first transferring Ms. Wei's funds from Ms. Lau's bank account in Vancouver to Mr. Chiu's bank accounts in Singapore and Hong Kong. Mr. Chiu further altered the status quo by breaching the terms of the Mareva Order by withdrawing further funds from his accounts in Hong Kong, for which he has been found in contempt. (Ms. Wei has a pending motion to have Ms. Lau similarly found in contempt of the Mareva Order, scheduled for February 19, 2019.)</P>
<P>37. With respect to (f), the strength of Ms. Wei's case also supports the relief sought in this application. Ms. Wei provided significant funds to the defendants to invest on her behalf. The Defendants admit to receiving the funds from Ms. Wei, and Mr. Chiu admits he owes money to Ms. Wei. Ms. Wei has a strong case at trial for repayment of the sums she advanced to Mr. Chiu and Ms. Lau.</P>
<P>38. With respect to (g), it is in the public interest that the preservation order be granted. A preservation order will effectively return Ms. Wei's funds to British Columbia to be held pending trial in circumstances where Mr. Chiu admitted that those funds were transferred out of the jurisdiction into his accounts in Hong Kong in the months and weeks prior to the commencement of the action. Mr. Chiu has already been found in contempt for further dissipating those funds to pay gambling debts to loan sharks in breach of a Mareva Order. The circumstances of this case strongly support granting the order sought.</P>
<P>39. There is no prejudice to Mr. Chiu in making the order. On his evidence, the funds in his HKD Account and the USD Account contain funds originating from Ms. Wei. Moreover, those accounts are currently frozen by the Mareva Order, and Mr. Chiu should not be accessing them. Should the Defendants ultimately succeed in this action, the funds will be returned to them. It is Ms. Wei and Ms. Wei alone, who suffers prejudice if the preservation order is not granted.</P>
<P>40. The balance of convenience clearly favours Ms. Wei.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICATION RESPONSE</TI>
<P><BOLD>Application response of:</BOLD> The Application Respondents, Allan Chiu and <BOLD>Mui</BOLD> Kwan Queenie Lau (the &ldquo;Defendants&rdquo;)</P>
<P>THIS IS A RESPONSE TO the Notice of Application of the Plaintiff, Rong Wei, filed February 13, 2019.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS CONSENTED TO</TI>
<P>The Application Respondent consents to the granting of the Orders set out in the following paragraphs of Part 1 of the Notice of Application on the following terms:</P>
<P>1. The application respondent consents to the granting of no orders set out in Part 1 of the Notice of Application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>ORDERS OPPOSED</TI>
<P>1. The application respondent opposes the granting of the orders set out in paragraphs 1&ndash;3 of Part 1 of the Notice of Application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>ORDERS ON WHICH NO POSITION IS TAKEN</TI>
<P>1. The application respondent takes no position on the granting of no orders set out in Part 1 of the Notice of Application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>4:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Nature of the Plaintiff and Mr. Chiu's Relationship</EM></TI>
<P>1. The plaintiff has admitted that the plaintiff and Mr. Chiu were at times involved in a romantic way and trips to Singapore and Europe.
<P1><EM>Affidavit #1 of R. Wei</EM> at paras. 68-69</P1></P>
<P>2. The lavish spending was a joint enterprise. Mr. Chiu spent over $140,000 USD on the international trips and the source of the funds was money being held for the plaintiff with credit card payments being paid by funds held on the plaintiff's behalf with her knowledge.
<P1><EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 109.</P1></P>
<P>3. However, the plaintiff and the defendant were involved in every aspect of each other's life and at the plaintiff's request, Mr. Chiu was involved in numerous aspects of the plaintiffs life which included:
<P1>(a) as early as May 31, 2016, the plaintiff requested the defendant was assisting with her daughter's educational planning and the two were planning trips to meet each other (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at Exhibit G&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) in June 2016, the plaintiff and Mr. Chiu travelled to Singapore together (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 85);</P1>
<P1>(c) in October of 2016, the plaintiff requested the defendant assist with the plaintiffs son's field trip (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at Exhibit Gla&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(d) in September 2016, the plaintiff and defendant travelled to Europe together, it was after this trip to Europe where Mr. Chiu asked for a personal loan and the plaintiff advised that funds provided and used were a gift and there was no expectation to repay the funds and, further, that funds could be used out of love and affection and the funds spent could be forgotten. An agreement was made to a conditional loan to repay sums borrowed and the loan would be offset by profits earned in trading accounts (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at Paragraph 128);</P1>
<P1>(e) In November, 2016, Ms. Wei began to suspect a reconciliation between the Defendants and delivered an e-mail demanding a return on investments that did not exist. (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 130 in response to paragraph 71.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Use of Fraudulent Records</EM></TI>
<P>4. The plaintiff has fraudulent created documents and sworn them to be true for the sole purpose of attempting to demonstrate funds transferred to the defendant were related to specific investments. Of note, the fraudulent statements include:
<P1>(a) As sworn at paragraph 30, the first page of Exhibit H to Wei Affidavit #1 was not provided to the plaintiff by Mr. Chiu and Mr. Chiu had never seen this document prior to receipt of the affidavit (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 60);</P1>
<P1>(b) As sworn at paragraph 31, Exhibit 1 to the Wei Affidavit #1 was not provided to the plaintiff and Mr. Chiu had never seen this document prior to receipt of the affidavit (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 61);</P1>
<P1>(c) As sworn at paragraph 36, the first page of Exhibit K to the Wei Affidavit #1 was not provided to the plaintiff and had not been seen prior to receipt of the affidavit (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 66);</P1>
<P1>(d) As sworn at paragraph 59, Exhibit S to the Wei Affidavit #1 was not provided to the plaintiff and had not been seen prior to reading the Wei #1 affidavit (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 66);</P1>
<P1>(e) As sworn at paragraph 73, Exhibit V to the Wei Affidavit was drafted by the plaintiff and while presented to the plaintiff, it was not signed by the Defendant and the signature located on the document is not that of Mr. Chiu (<EM>Affidavit #2 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 66).</P1></P>
<P>5. In order to explain the operation of underground banking, the Plaintiff provided a Bank of Montreal statement that includes the names of unknown individuals who provided funds to the plaintiff. The unknown individuals are part of the underground banking system who move small amounts of funds to avoid the attention of Chinese authorities.
<P1><EM>Affidavit #5 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 2</P1></P>
<P>6. On February 26, 2016 and March 7, 2016, the plaintiff confirmed that she was using underground banking to deliver funds to Canada and that the funds could be delivered from underground banking to wherever it was preferred.
<P1><EM>Affidavit #5 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraphs 4-5</P1></P>
<P>7. Further, the plaintiff advised that funds from underground banking were being deposited into her mother's account in Hong Kong to which the plaintiff had access.
<P1><EM>Affidavit #5 of Allan Chiu</EM> at paragraph 6</P1></P>
<P>8. It cannot be denied is that the plaintiff has used underground funds to facilitate the delivery of funds to Canada.</P>
<P>9. Further, the plaintiff has not produced any records to demonstrate the source of funds and cannot demonstrate the funds delivered are her own and not received through illegitimate sources.</P>
<P>10. The affidavit material of Ms. Wei contains evidence that Ms. Wei provided funds to the Defendants at various times but the source of the funds is conspicuously absent.</P>
<P>11. As a consequence of the evidence related to the transfer of funds from underground banks, as admitted, the sources of the funds Ms. Wei purported to provide to the plaintiff as her own are relevant to the action. To that end, a request for production of banking records has been provided as well as an inquiry as to whether the promissory note contained at Exhibit V of Affidavit #1 of Rong Wei.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. The defendant accepts the four part test for a preservation order as described by the plaintiff at paragraph 18 of the Notice of Application.</P>
<P>2. The funds provided were provided to Mr. Chiu out of love and affection or, alternatively, as a loan that would be repaid when Mr. Chiu had the capacity to do so. The plaintiff has not led sufficient evidence to satisfy the third part of the test that there is a substantial question to be tried.</P>
<P>3. While it is accepted that the threshold for success is relatively low and that the plaintiff is not required to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case, the claim for funds grossly exceeds the amount of money that Mr. Chiu admitted owing to Ms. Wei.</P>
<P>4. The doctrine of unjust enrichment is an equitable concept. Even if a plaintiff establishes a <EM>prima facie</EM> claim of unjust enrichment, the court must additionally assess whether the clean hands doctrine precludes the remedies sought.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Craiggs v. Owens</SOC><CITE>2012 BCSC 29</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Craiggs]</P1></P>
<P>5. The clean hands doctrine was described as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The clean hands doctrine serves to deny equitable relief where the misdeeds or misconduct has &ldquo;an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for... it must be shown, in order to justify a refusal or relief, that there is such an &ldquo;immediate and necessary relation&rdquo; between the relief sought and the delinquent behaviour in question that it would be unjust to grant that particular relief.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Craiggs, Mayer v. Osborne Contracting Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1249</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>6. While the plaintiff has transferred funds to the Defendants, material misrepresentation and non&mdash;disclosure in attaining the Mareva order and the use of underground banking raises a reasonable suspicion that the funds she says are owed are not her own and, more importantly, are potentially received through immoral and potentially illegal sources.</P>
<P>7. Of the relevant factors delineated by Lambert J.A., in C.B.C. assessing the balance of convenience include the strength of the applicant's case, factors affecting the public's trust, and factors affecting the balance of justice and convenience.</P>
<P>8. In that regard, while the defendants admit receiving the funds and that some money is owing, the plaintiff has fraudulently created documents to significantly inflate the scope of the claim and has used a mechanism, underground banking, to deliver significant funds that are dishonest and unethical.</P>
<P>9. The defence of <EM>ex turpi causa</EM>, meaning a person cannot found a claim of action based on her own illegal or immoral acts, is a complete answer to the claims of the plaintiff.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Norberg v. Wynrib</SOC><CITE>[1992] 2 S.C.R. 266</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 79.</P1></P>
<P>10. <EM>Ex turpi causa</EM> is concerned with the enforcement of rights by the courts and the courts will not enforce what would otherwise be enforceable if the right arises out of an act committed by the person asserting the right which is sufficiently anti-social to justify the courts refusing to enforce that right.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hardy v. Motor Insurers' Bureau</SOC><CITE>[1964] 2 All E.R. 742</CITE><COURTJUR>Eng. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>11. The effect of the rule is to bar a plaintiff from recovery for loss or injury which is suffered in connection with a course of conduct that is clearly reprehensible and involves the commission of breaches of the Criminal Code of Canada.</P>
<P>12. The minimum requirement of the doctrine is:
<P1>(a) the plaintiff must be engaged in conduct clearly reprehensible, typically in breach of the <EM>Criminal Code of Canada</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(b) there must be a connection between this activity and the loss or injury;</P1>
<P1>(c) the foregoing requirements are not alone to justify application of the doctrine as the court must additionally be satisfied that the offence is sufficiently reprehensible and its connection sufficiently close to be disentitled to assistance.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mandzukv. Vierira</SOC><CITE>[1986] B.C.J. No. 332</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>29 D.L.R. (4th) 677</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>BCSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 17.</P1></P>
<P>13. <EM>Ex turpi causa</EM> is intended to defend the integrity of the legal system and the reputation in which the court ought to be held by law-abiding members of the community. The question to ask is this: is it manifestly unacceptable to fair-minded, or right-thinking, people that a court should lend assistance to a plaintiff who has defied the law.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mandzuk v. Vierira</SOC><CITE>[1986] B.C.J. No. 332</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>29 D.L.R. (4th) 677</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>BCSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 19.</P1></P>
<P>14. A person commits an offence who knowingly makes a false statement in writing with the intent that it should be relied on with respect to financial condition... for the purpose of procuring... her benefit the making of a promissory note. The plaintiff has fraudulently made a false statement stating that the promissory note she prepared was signed by Mr. Chiu.
<P1><EM>Criminal Code (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46)</EM>, s. 362(1)(c)(vi)</P1></P>
<P>15. The plaintiff has made multiple references to use of underground banks and the source of those funds is relevant in order to assess the potential of a violation of money laundering by using or sending funds from China to Canada, directly or occasionally through Hong Kong, with the intent to conceal the proceeds if the proceeds were obtained or derived from the commission of a crime or an act that, if it occurred in Canada, would have constituted an enterprise crime offence or substance offence.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Allan Chiu, resident of Metro Vancouver with an address for service in this matter of 700-595 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the husband of the Co-Defendant, Mui Kwan Queenie Lau, and am a personally named defendant in these proceedings and, as such, have personal knowledge of the facts and matters set out herein to this Affidavit, except where the same are stated to be on information and belief and, as to those matters, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am aware of my obligation to produce my financial records. As particularized in my Schedule of Assets attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to my 1<SUP>st</SUP> Affidavit sworn June 21, 2017, I have had bank accounts with the following financial institutions:
<P1>(a) two accounts at Standard Chartered Bank, 1 Harbourfront Walk, Vivo City, Singapore which were:
<P2>(i) Xtrasaver SGD account #XXXXXXXXXX; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) FCYsaver USD account #XXXXXXXXXX.</P2>
(the &ldquo;Singapore Accounts&rdquo;)</P1>
<P1>(b) two accounts at Bank of China, 1 Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong which are:
<P2>(i) HKD Savings account #XXXXXXXXXX and</P2>
<P2>(ii) MTC account #XXXXXXXXXX.</P2>
(the &ldquo;<BOLD>Hong Kong Accounts</BOLD>&rdquo;)</P1></P>
<P>3. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is this affidavit is my 1<SUP>st</SUP> Affidavit sworn June 21, 2017.</P>
<P>4. With respect to the Singapore Accounts, I was advised by way of letter dated July 6, 2018 from Standard Chartered Bank that the Singapore Accounts were closed effective September 6, 2018. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a letter I received from Yap Jee Hoe, Regional Head, CDD Operations for Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Limited (&ldquo;<BOLD>Standard Chartered Singapore</BOLD>&rdquo;) dated July 6, 2018.</P>
<P>5. My counsel has advised me, and I verily believe it to be true, that records for the Singapore Accounts have been provided to the plaintiff for the period January 22, 2016 to July 21, 2018. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the produced Singapore Account records.</P>
<P>6. I have personally attended to requesting all bank records for the Standard Chartered Account. In response, I received an email from &ldquo;Saras&rdquo; a Client Care Executive with Standard Chartered Singapore dated February 14, 2019 attached to which were the records contained at Exhibit C to this affidavit. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the email dated February 14, 2019 from Saras.</P>
<P>7. I have personally made numerous phone calls to XXXXXXXXXX before the records that were provided in the email dated February 14, 2019 referenced at paragraph 6 and after. After February 14, 2019, I have continued to call Standard Chartered Singapore to request records for the period May 2015 to December 2015. My most recent follow-up phone call with Zrin on April 2 at approximately 11 pm (PST) to Standard Chartered Singapore advised me that I should receive the additional statements in approximately 3 days.</P>
<P>8. With respect to the Hong Kong Accounts, I contacted the Bank of China in Hong Kong to request records. I was advised that the bank was unable to provide records because of a restriction noted on the file related to the Hong Kong Accounts.</P>
<P>9. I am advised, and verily believe it to be true, that my counsel has attempted to contact the Bank of China in Hong Kong by letter on my behalf.</P>
<P>10. I understand the importance of fully complying with the court order of Madam J Dillon, and I am very sorry for the delay in obtaining the financial documents, and I am continuing my efforts to obtain the records that must be produced.</P>
<P>11. I write this affidavit in support of an order requiring the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> parties to produce all of the financial records that I have been unable to secure on my own.</P>

<P>4. With respect to the accounts at paragraph 3 of this affidavit, I provided through my counsel all financial records from June 1, 2015 to present for:
<P1>(a) all accounts at the Bank of Montreal; and</P1>
<P1>(b) BMW Finance.</P1></P>
<P>5. With respect to the accounts at paragraph 3 of this affidavit, I provided through my counsel all financial records from June 1, 2015 to December 12, 2018;
<P1>(a) all accounts at CIBC; and</P1>
<P1>(b) all accounts at Scotiabank.</P1></P>
<P>6. I have been advised and verily believe it to be true that my counsel has requested the remaining two months of records from CIBC and Scotiabank.</P>
<P>7. With respect to the accounts at paragraph 3 of this affidavit, I provided through my counsel the records from November 22, 2017 to February, 2019 for my Costco Credit Card.</P>
<P>8. I have personally made numerous calls to the customer service number 1 -800-723-3500 between March 11, 2019 to today's date. Initially, I was informed the records can only be retrieved for 18 months prior to the date they are produced. However, I insisted I receive records from June 1, 2015. During a phone call with an employee or service agent named Paul at 11: 53 a.m. on April 1, 2019, he confirmed my request for statements was in progress and the statements should arrive in approximately 21 days.</P>
<P>9. With respect to the accounts at paragraph 3 of this affidavit, I provided through my counsel the records from November 25, 2017 to October 24, 2018 for my Hudson's Bay Credit Card.</P>
<P>10. I have personally made numerous calls to the customer service number 1 -866-640-7858 between March 11, 2019 to today's date. Initially, I was informed the records can only be retrieved for 12 months prior to the date they are produced. However, I insisted I receive records from June 1, 2015. During a phone call with an employee or service agent named Fouzan on April 1, 2019, he confirmed that the records would be produced from June 1, 2015 to present. I was not provided an estimated time for the records to arrive.</P>
<P>11. With respect to the accounts at paragraph 3 of this affidavit, I have been unable to secure financial records from Toronto Dominion Bank.</P>
<P>12. I have been advised and verily believe it to be true that my counsel has delivered letters requesting records from Toronto Dominion Bank. I have been advised that Toronto Dominion Bank has not responded to the requests.</P>
<P>13. I have reviewed affidavit #5 of Sarah Culver and verily believe it to be true that my counsel have delivered letters requesting records from Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>14. In addition to the written requests, I have called the customer service number of 852 -2886-8866 on numerous occasions between March 10, 2019 to today's date. During a phone call with an employee or service agents, I was consistently provided the statement that the account was frozen and the bank could not entertain any request from the account holder. The only agent that would provide his name was Mr. Sin at extension 55987, who confirmed the bank would not entertain a request from the account holder during a phone call on March 31, 2019.</P>
<P>15. I understand that my efforts to obtain the Standard Chartered Bank financial records have been successful, because today I was advised by my counsel that Standard Chartered Bank has advised that the records are ready for pick-up but a fee has to be paid. Attached and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of a letter received by my counsel today, from Standard Chartered.</P>
<P>16. I understand the importance of fully complying with the court order of Madam J Dillon, I have been fully focussed on taking all steps within my abilities and control to fully comply with each and every term of the order. I am apologetic that there has been delay on the part of 3<SUP>rd</SUP> parties as it relates to production and compliance with the order.</P>
<P>17. I write this affidavit in support of an order requiring the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> parties to produce all of the financial records that I have been unable to secure on my own.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>APPLICATION RESPONSE</TI>
<P>Application response of: the Plaintiff, Eliza Wei (the &ldquo;<BOLD>application respondent</BOLD>&rdquo;)</P>
<P>THIS IS A RESPONSE TO the Notice of Application of the Defendant filed April 4, 2019.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS CONSENTED TO</TI>
<P>The application respondent consents to the granting of the orders set out in the following paragraphs of Part 1 of the notice of application on the following terms: NIL.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>The application respondent takes no position on the granting of the orders set out in the following paragraphs of Part 1 of the notice of application on the following terms: NIL.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>4:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Defendant's Application is a Breach of a Court Order and Ought not to be Heard</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. On March 8, 2019, Madam Justice Dillon found the defendant Queenie Lau in contempt of court for &ldquo;flagrant&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious&rdquo; breaches of a <EM>Mareva</EM> Order obtained by the plaintiff in May 2017 and for failing to attend her examination for discovery without lawful excuse</P>
<P>2. Ms. Lau's recent contempt finding is but a continuation of a pattern of disrespect for court orders and the court process generally. Dillon J. described Ms. Lau's conduct in the litigation in the following terms:
<QUOTE><P>[43] It is apparent that Lau has treated this litigation cavalierly. She has failed to produce documents in a timely manner, or at all, thus thwarting until now attempts to determine whether assets have been dissipated and so frustrating the very purpose of the <EM>Mareva</EM> order. She has failed to attend at examinations for discovery without lawful excuse. She has seriously breached the <EM>Mareva</EM> order. She has caused delay of the trial. Lau had previously been put on notice that her response could be struck for failure to attend at examination for discovery. This is a serious matter.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>3. in light of Ms. Lau's conduct and failure to produce documents (including documents previously ordered produced by Mr. Justice Grauer on December 4, 2018), Dillon J. ordered Ms. Lau to produce copies of &ldquo;all bank and financial records in her name, in the name of any alias, or in the name of other entities which Lau exercises control from the period June 1, 2015 to the present, within 30 days of the date of this order (which was made on March 8, 2019)&rdquo;. (Notably, the documents ordered produced by Dillon J. included classes of documents captured by the previous order of Grauer J. that Ms. Lau did not comply with.)</P>
<P>4. As a result of Ms. Lau's pattern of conduct in this litigation, Dillon J.&mdash;on her own motion after a two-day hearing on March 4-5, 2019&mdash;expressly ordered that no application of Ms. Lau may be heard in this Court until Ms. Lau has complied with the above document production order. Dillon J. did not create a carve-out in her order for applications to vary her order.</P>
<P>5. Ms. Lau, as is clear from the nature of the application before this Court, has not complied with Dillon J.'s order.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. This Court should not entertain Ms. Lau's application. In light of Dillon J.'s order, and the underlying circumstances that led Dillon J, to grant the order on her own motion, Ms. Lau should not be proceeding in regular chambers on less than one day's notice, but rather should be before Dillon J. Of note, Ms. Lau's counsel submitted a Request to Appear before Dillon J. on April 2, underscoring that this application is properly heard by Dillon J. Ms. Lau's application is not properly before this Court and ought to be dismissed.</P>
<P>2. Dillon J.'s order was clear and reflected her findings of Ms. Lau's conduct in this litigation. Dillon J.'s finding that Ms. Lau was in contempt of Court and her description of Ms. Lau's conduct are buttressed by Bank of Montreal bank records produced by Ms. Lau on April 4, 2019. This bank account was opened by Ms. Lau after the issuance of the <EM>Mareva</EM> Order and never disclosed to plaintiff's counsel as a source of funds for monthly living expenses, which allowed her to surreptitiously access funds from that account in breach of the Mareva Order between October 2017 and December 2018.</P>
<P>3. The bank records produced yesterday cover the period from December 8, 2018 to March 7, 2019 and show that Ms. Lau also breached the monthly spending limit (which was varied from $3,500 to $1,000 pursuant to a consent order granted by Grauer J. on December 4, 2018) in the months of January and February 2019. Most egregiously, Ms. Lau spent more than $1,000 on February 20, 2019 on a monthly lease payment for her BMW&mdash;exactly one week <UNDER>after</UNDER> swearing an affidavit in response to the Plaintiff's motion that Ms. Lau be found in contempt for spending in excess of the monthly limit and failing to provide advance notice of the source of funds.</P>
<P>4. Should this Court decide to hear Ms. Lau's application, Ms. Lau's application for an extension should be dismissed. The Plaintiff will take no position on the application for the third-party financial institutions to produce records, provided that the order stipulate that copies of ail records produced are delivered to Plaintiffs counsel within two business days.</P>
<P>5. The sole legal basis articulated by Ms. Lau for an order for an extension is the court's inherent jurisdiction. The evidence simply does not support that the Court should be exercising its discretion in favour of Ms. Lau to yet again extend a deadline for the production of bank records.</P>
<P>6. This case has clear parallels with the decision of Madam Justice Choi in <CASEREF><SOC>MOBE, Ltd. v. Loudoun</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 2667</CITE></CASEREF>. In that case, the plaintiff obtained an order that the defendants produce certain classes of documents within 14 days. The defendants brought an application to extend the time under the order by an additional 21 days.</P>
<P>7. Choi J. noted that the defendant's application was &ldquo;highly discretionary&rdquo; (para. 11) and the question was whether it was &ldquo;just and convenient&rdquo; for the court to exercise its discretion to extend the deadline for production of documents (para. 14). Choi J. denied the defendant's application, citing the length of time that the request for documents had been outstanding:
<QUOTE><P>[14] For the reasons that follow, I decline to exercise my discretion to extend the time under the order. The documents ordered were originally requested in March 2016. The defendants were well aware of the documents and the information sought at least five months prior to the granting of the order. No holiday after August 31 should have caused the defendants to be unable to fulfil the order pronounced in the time required in these circumstances.</P>
<P>[15] The defendants' reasons for the delay do not warrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of the defendants. The defendants' application for extension of time is therefore dismissed.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. The facts of this case are even less deserving of the court granting Ms. Lau an indulgence. Not only is she before this Court having recently been found in contempt of a court order (for which she has not purged or even apologized), the extension Ms. Lau is seeking is to produce documents first requested in early October 2018. The documents were then ordered to be listed by Grauer J. by December 18, 2018, varied on the defendant's application to January 14, 2019.</P>
<P>9. Ms. Lau, although offering vague evidence about attempts to comply with Dillon J.'s most recent order, says nothing about steps taken after receiving the document demand in October 2018 or after the orders of Grauer J. and Master Scarth (for which she is in breach).</P>
<P>10. Although Ms. Lau in her affidavit attempts to deflect blame to various third-party financial institutions for her current plight, the fault lies with her and her alone. Dillon J.'s order was made on March 8, 2019. Ms. Lau's evidence of steps taken to comply with the order are that she signed an authorization permitting the release of records to her solicitors on March 18, 2019&mdash;ten days after the granting of the order&mdash;and to having placed calls to customer service departments of several of the third-party financial institutions on &ldquo;numerous occasions&rdquo;. Ms. Lau provides little details of her efforts in that regard, only providing specifics of calls made on March 31 and April 1 at a time when it must have been clear that she would be bringing this application and needed to adduce evidence of her &ldquo;efforts&rdquo; to comply with the order. It appears that even a finding of contempt and the imposition of strict terms is not enough to motivate Ms. Lau to comply with orders of this Court.</P>
<P>11. As in <EM>MOBE, Ltd.</EM>, Ms. Lau's excuses for the delay in producing documents do not warrant the Court exercising its discretion in favour of Ms. Lau. The application for an extension of time should be dismissed.</P>
<P>12. In the event that this Court decides to grant Ms. Lau's application, the Plaintiff says that the extension should be for no longer than 14 days. The documents ordered have been outstanding for six months. There is simply no justification to grant another 30-day extension, and there is no indication in the evidence that 30 is needed by any of the financial institutions.</P></BLOCK2>
