The subject work carried out during November, 2015, by the Defendant, as is stated in its Defence (Tab 3: paras. 5 &amp; 6) was in the nature of working on the main sewer line which included a section directly in front of the homes of the Plaintiffs on Shore Road. It was during this work, it will be admitted, that damages were caused to the Plaintiffs' lateral sewer lines which extend from the main line to the subject homes. Subsequent to the principal work, sewage entered into both the homes; due, it is believed, to blockages in the two lateral lines leading from the street to the subject homes. The Defendant responded to the complaints of the Defendant and it again opened up the ground and effected repairs to both of the subject lateral lines; this repair work took place that December. The allegation is that the Defendant carried out its work, the first time in November, in a negligent manner.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>II&mdash;WHAT THE PLAINTIFFS REQUEST OF THIS COURT</UNDER></TI>
<P>[3] At this stage of the proceeding (no trial dates having, yet, been set by the Court), the Plaintiffs seek Orders, drafts of which in connection this application have been filed:
<P1>1.) Approval of the Requested Amendment of the Statement of Claim; and</P1>
<P1>2.) Production from the Defendant: being that there is to be delivered to the Plaintiffs' Counsel a chronological list of all claims, made against it, within a reasonable time, over the past ten years, in respect to sewage ingress into residences where such ingress had occurred at the time or shortly after the work was carried out by it, or its agents, the work being as was carried out in the instant case, that is, installation or repair of lateral sewers, in addition to all its file materials, including handwritten notes, in respect to these third party claims, and which includes all correspondence, back and forth, between it and third parties, including the third party complainants, and including outside-workers employed by the Defendant; and which production is to include all correspondence, back and forth, between it and any outside claim adjusters; and which production is to include all &ldquo;documents&rdquo; and &ldquo;electronic information&rdquo; and sorted as defined in this court's Civil Procedure Rule, 14.01.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>III&mdash;CPR RULES 14 &amp; 15</UNDER></TI>
<P>[4] The relevant rules are annexed at tabs [Tab 4 &amp; 5]; we but emphasize certain of the provisions:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>14.01(2)</BOLD> &ldquo;A determination of relevancy or irrelevancy under this Part is not binding at the trial of an action, or on the hearing of an application.&rdquo; ...</P>
<P><BOLD>14.03(1)</BOLD> &ldquo;Nothing in Part 5 diminishes the application of the implied undertaking not to use information disclosed or discovered in a proceeding for a purpose outside the proceeding, without the permission of a judge.&rdquo; ...</P>
<P><BOLD>14.05(3)</BOLD> &ldquo;[Producible is that which] could lead to relevant evidence that is not privileged. ...&rdquo;</P>
<P><BOLD>14.08(1)</BOLD>&ldquo;Making full disclosure of relevant documents, electronic information, and other things is presumed to be necessary for justice in a proceeding.&rdquo; ...</P>
<P><BOLD>14.09(2)(c)</BOLD> &ldquo;[There is a] presumption in favour of disclosure ...&rdquo;</P>
<P><BOLD>14.09(3)</BOLD> &ldquo;A judge may order a party who fails to respond to a demand for production to indemnify the other party for the expenses of obtaining an order for production.&rdquo; ...</P>
<P><BOLD>15.07(2)</BOLD> &ldquo;A judge may not give directions limiting disclosure or production of a relevant document, unless the presumption in Rule 14.08, of Rule 14&mdash;Disclosure and Discovery in General, is rebutted.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[5] There is no question, under the CPRs, that each party is required to produce documents &ldquo;relating&rdquo; to matters in issue. The task for a judge, essentially, is to balance the interests of disclosure and confidentiality. If any of the requested disclosure (and we are not at all sure the Defendant has even looked into the request) has information contained in them, that the Defendant considers confidential can be, initially, redacted.</P>
<P>[6] A chambers judge, should not tie the hands of a trial judge, should the matter come on for trial. What would a trial judge want to see to dispose of the matter in a just way? It is no secret that parties getting ready for trial are required to research and investigate, in advance of the trial. For the individual Plaintiff this research is difficult, where in most cases, as is the instant case, the corporate Defendant holds all the cards. The Plaintiff expects, in the interests of justice that these cards be laid on the table.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>VI&mdash;LEGISLATION &amp; &ldquo;GROSS NEGLIGENCE&rdquo;</UNDER></TI>
<P>[7] To be found in the <EM>Halifax Regional Water Commission Act</EM>, which act of the legislature created the Defendant's existence as a corporate body, sets out clause 26 (set in full at Tab 6, herewith) that a Plaintiff must succeed in proving &ldquo;gross negligence,&rdquo; as was pleaded in the Defence.</P>
<P>[8] Though there will be extensive evidence and expert testimony, and, indeed, extensive argument as to the law in respect to the expression &ldquo;Gross negligence,&rdquo; we might say in connection with the instant application, this much: The burden is on the Plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that negligence occurred, to whatever degree by which one might want to measure it. Past claims of a similar nature are relevant evidence.</P>
<P>[9] The Plaintiffs quote from the <CASEREF><SOC>Miller v. Royal Bank of Canada</SOC><CITE>2008 NSCA</CITE></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[26] The respondent's accident free record was a relevant factor for the trial judge to consider. LeBlanc, J. was entitled to take it into account in his assessment of all of the circumstances surrounding this mishap. He was careful to say that this particular feature was not, in and of itself, dispositive on the issue of liability. There is no merit to the appellant?s complaint.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[10] It has been the writer's experience in the prosecution of numerous tort cases over the years that the, and oft raised, argument by the Defence, is, &ldquo;It has never happened before.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[11] A number of cases have been reviewed where such a Defence argument is raised, including: <CASEREF><SOC>Eady et al. v. Tenderenda</SOC><YEAR>1973</YEAR><COURTJUR>NSCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Levy v. Canadian Pacific Express Co. et al</SOC><YEAR>1944</YEAR><COURTJUR>NSCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Secunda Marine Services Ltd. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company</SOC><YEAR>2006</YEAR><COURTJUR>NSCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v.

Park Place Centre Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>2011</YEAR><COURTJUR>NSCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> ... All of which&mdash;and it seems many, many more&mdash;dealt with prior experiences of the Defendant.</P>
<P>[12] The Plaintiffs' quote Allen M. Linden:
<QUOTE><P>... It is clear, that something more than ordinary negligence is demanded when the prefix &ldquo;gross&rdquo; is utilized. ... The Supreme Court of Canada has decided that gross negligence means &ldquo;very great negligence&rdquo;. [The learned author cites both <CASEREF><SOC>Kingston v. Drennan</SOC><YEAR>1897</YEAR></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Cowper v. Studer</SOC><YEAR>1950</YEAR></CASEREF>.] Another way gross negligence has been defined in automobile cases is that the conduct must amount to a &ldquo;marked departure from the standard by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor-cars govern themselves&rdquo;. ... [cases cited.] A plaintiff may be required to go even further and show a &lsquo;very marked departure&rsquo; from the standard to fact to be found by the trial judge, or the jury, if there is one. ... [cases cited].</P>
<P>In deciding whether there has been gross negligence a court must consider &ldquo;the cumulative effect of all the factors producing the casualty and not fall into the error, where there are several factors, of considering them individually. Taken alone, in a given set of circumstances, excessive speed, improper lookout, breach of the rules of the road and lack of control, and many others, may or may not amount to gross negligence, but when considered together their totality may be over-whelming.&rdquo; ... [case cited.] Thus, a defendant who pulls out to pass in dangerous circumstances will be found grossly negligent if he is also travelling at an excessive rate of speed, with bald tires. Similarly, the consumption of alcohol is a factor that will be considered, along with other acts of negligence, in deciding if the negligence is gross. ... [case cited.] (<EM>Canadian Tort Law</EM> (3rd edition), Butterworths, Toronto.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>[13] And so, the Plaintiffs conclude: it would appear that the Plaintiffs are obliged to secure all the ammunition they can find when presenting their case at trial; they should not be hampered in any way if justice is to be served.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V"><UNDER>V&mdash;COSTS PAYABLE ON APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>[14] We quote from <CASEREF><SOC>Jewell v. I-Flow</SOC><YEAR>2017</YEAR><COURTJUR>NSSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (Warner J.):
<QUOTE><P>[4] The inclusion of Part 8 in Dr. Gentles' report meets the definition, at this stage of this proceeding, of justification for finding that the request of the plaintiff is likely to lead to relevant evidence on the issue of liability. ...</P>
<P>[28] I wrote a decision in a corporate oppression case, <CASEREF><SOC>Merks Poultry Farms v Wittenberg</SOC><CITE>2010 NSSC 395</CITE></CASEREF>, saying litigation that appears to be long-winded and may go on for some time, costs should be payable at the time and not long after unless payable forthwith would interfere with the ability to get to trial. In other words, prevent a party from being able to carry on the litigation.</P>
<P>[29] I followed that practice in all of the decisions I have had since, including several of <EM>the Knowledge House</EM> ones, involving serious litigation, so I agree it will be payable forthwith.</P>
<P>[30] That is the practice, and I think it is changing in our court more and more. It did not use to be that way but, in long litigation, it should be that way.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
