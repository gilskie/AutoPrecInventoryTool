<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> STATEMENT OF CLAIM (Amended Notice of Action issued on January 25, 2011)</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiffs claim against the defendants:
<P1>a) damages in the sum of $6,235,719.28;</P1>
<P1>b) prejudgment interest on the sum in paragraph (a) above, pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act;</P1>
<P1>c) punitive damages in the further sum of $2,000,000.00;</P1>
<P1>d) their costs of the action;</P1>
<P1>e) such further and other relief as may seem just.</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE PARTIES</TI>
<P>2. The plaintiff Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Company of Canada (&ldquo;Royal&rdquo;) is a federal Canadian corporation which carries on business as an underwriter and issuer of among other things, property and automobile insurance, throughout Canada, with a head office located in Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P>3. The plaintiff Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company (&ldquo;CNS&rdquo;) is a federal corporation which carries on business as an underwriter and issuer of among other things, property and automobile insurance in British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada including Ontario, with a head office located in Vancouver, British Columbia. CNS is a<UNDER>n affiliated corporation to Royal, both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of a common parent corporation</UNDER>.</P>
<P>4. The defendant The Co-operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-operators&rdquo;) is a federal Canadian corporation which carries on business as an underwriter and issuer of among other things, property and automobile insurance, throughout Canada, with a head office located in Guelph, Ontario.</P>
<P>5. The defendant 2421593 Canada Inc. (&ldquo;242-Canada&rdquo;) is a federal Canadian corporation, which prior to its change of name on September 3, 2009, was named Vancity Insurance Services Ltd. (&ldquo;Vancity&rdquo;), which carried on business as an insurance broker offering automobile and property insurance policies amongst other insurance products primarily to customers of a related corporation Vancouver City Savings Credit Union through offices of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union throughout British Columbia. The Defendant 242-Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of Co-operators.</P>
<P>6. The defendant Federated Agencies Limited (&ldquo;Federated&rdquo;) is a Saskatchewan corporation which carries on business as an insurance broker with a place of business in Ontario located in Guelph. Federated is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooperators, with offices in among other places, Mississauga, Ontario.</P>
<P>7. The defendant Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (&ldquo;VCU&rdquo;) is a British Columbia corporation which carries on business as a credit union in British Columbia. Vancity was at the material times a wholly owned a subsidiary of VCU.</P>
<P>8. The defendant <UNDER>7081332 Canada Ltd. (&ldquo;708-Canada&rdquo;) is a federal Canadian corporation</UNDER> which purchased Vancity effective September 1, 2009. This defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of either Federated or Co-operators and is part of The Co-operators Group of Companies.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE AGREEMENT</TI>
<P>9. In or about the period beginning in late June 2008 and ending in or about the middle of July, 2008, Vancity entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs whereby Vancity accepted verbally the offer of CNS and RSA (&ldquo;the Agreement&rdquo;) submitted in March and April 2008 to Vancity at its request, being the submission of an offer in response to Van city's written Request for Interest (&ldquo;RFI&rdquo;) dated February 29, 2008 which, at Van City's request and intention, envisioned a long term &lsquo;partnership&rsquo;, in the colloquial not legal sense, with an insurance company interested &ldquo;in developing a sustainable competitive personal lines product offering&rdquo; of property insurance products (&ldquo;the Insurance Program&rdquo;) such submission of the offer in the form of a response to Van city's RFI being &ldquo;the first step to participating in a strategic long -term growth relationship with Vancity&rdquo;, as Vancity held out and represented to the plaintiffs in its RFI. Throughout, Vancity knew that while the memorialization of the Agreement was to be with CNS, Royal was an active participant, would be providing the funding for CNS to carry out the Agreement, and that Royal had national and international expertise and had the capital, technology, management and merger/rollover expertise needed to ensure that the Agreement would succeed, and throughout Vancity dealt with both plaintiffs as if they were joint contracting parties to the Agreement.</P>
<P>10. The essential terms of the Agreement were:
<P1>a) the plaintiffs would be exclusive suppliers and the Agreement would have a term of five years;</P1>
<P1>b) CNS and/or Royal would underwrite the Insurance Programs which would be marketed by Vancity during the term of the Agreement;</P1>
<P1>c) the basic commission structure for the Insurance Program payable to Vancity would be 25% on Home policies, and a sliding scale of up to 5% on Home policies depending upon the performance of that book of insurance business; Vancity was to be paid an additional 5% commission on roll over business by way of renewals from existing policies issued by other insurers.</P1></P>
<P>11. Although not a term of the Agreement, the Plaintiffs later agreed to pay a signing bonus to Vancity (the &ldquo;Bonus&rdquo;) in the amount of $135,000 and the Plaintiffs and Vancity agreed that termination of the Agreement would require two year<UNDER>s</UNDER> advance written notice.</P>
<P>12. During the foregoing late June 2008 to mid July 2008 period, Vancity represented to the plaintiffs and held out to the plaintiffs as follows:
<P1>(a) On June 28th, 2008, Vancity advised CNS that CNS had been selected as the sole carrier (exclusive &lsquo;partner&rsquo;) with Vancity under the Insurance Program.</P1>
<P1>(b) On July 3rd, 2008, Vancity met with CNS &ldquo;to ensure a common understanding of what we are committing to&rdquo; at which they discussed and agreed to further operational details such as Vancity's expectation that the plaintiffs would step in earlier than January 1st, as some or all of its existing sources of insurers would be expected to stop renewing policies or writing new policies once word got out, as it would, that CNS/Royal were Vancity's exclusive carrier;</P1>
<P1>(c) On July 3rd, 2008, a target date of January 1st 2009 was established for a public roll-out of a fully branded customized Vancity insurance product, and the plaintiffs would hire a project manager for this project;</P1>
<P1>(d) On July 4th, 2008, arrangements were made for CNS to attend branch office visits of Vancity with a representative of Vancity;</P1>
<P1>(e) On July 8th, 2008, Vancity announced to its head office and branch staff, that it had reached a major milestone in its program to establish a private label Person Lines (the Insurance Program) and that it had decided to proceed with &ldquo;a program underwritten by a single insurer and that insurer will be&rdquo; RSA [Royal]/CNS;</P1>
<P1>(f) CNS/Royal were invited and did attend Vancity's project meeting on July 10, 2008;</P1>
<P1>(g) On July 14, 2008, Vancity issued a press release announcing it &ldquo;had inked a major deal with a national insurer to underwrite an exclusive VC [Vancity] branded home insurance product&rdquo;.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>POST AGREEMENT ACTIVITIES</TI>
<P>13. Over the course of the next several months, the plaintiffs and Vancity proceeded to implement the Agreement and make it operational by:
<P1>a) Training staff;</P1>
<P1>b) Establishing computer programs and other operational and administrative procedures;</P1>
<P1>c) Hiring a project manager;</P1>
<P1>d) Underwriting and issuing insurance policies in advance of the contemplated January 1st public roll-out date of the Insurance Program in order to accommodate Vancity's need for replacement insurance for its customers whose existing policies were coming up for renewal but whose issuing insurers had become unwilling to renew in light of the public knowledge that the plaintiffs were to become the exclusive carriers for Vancity, and for insurance for new customers, all as expected and provided for as per paragraph 10(b) above;</P1>
<P1>e) Paid the paragraph 11 Bonus of $135,000 to Vancity;</P1>
<P1>f) In February 2009 worked together on providing additional claims services.</P1></P>
<P>14. The Agreement needed to be memorialized in writing and the plaintiffs worked to do this through the fall of 2008. Beginning in and following December, 2008, Vancity began dragging its feet, told the plaintiffs at the end of December that it would not cash the Bonus cheque of $135,000 it had received until the written memorialization of the Agreement was completed, and then continued to drag its feet for some months more into 2009.</P>
<P>15. Unknown to the plaintiffs, Vancity and VCU had decided at some point in the fall of 2008 that Vancity would be sold. Vancity did not disclose this to the plaintiffs but instead wished to have the plaintiffs continue with the operational and administrative work and the issuing of renewal or new policies to its customers under the Insurance Program while it was determined who would purchase Vancity. Consequently Vancity left in place the Agreement and the impression that it was proceeding with the Insurance Program, and continued to work on operational and administrative procedures such as claims services in February 2009, and the plaintiffs continued to issue insurance policies under the Agreement for the Insurance Program.</P>
<P>16. In the spring of 2009, Vancity continued to work under the Insurance Program with the plaintiffs. When the plaintiffs expressed frustration at the delay in memorializing the Agreement, Vancity replied, untruthfully, that the &ldquo;wheels of commerce are slow here ... at the present time&rdquo; when the truth, undisclosed to the plaintiffs, was that VCU and Vancity wanted to avoid memorializing the Agreement thinking, wrongly, that if nothing in writing was signed, any buyer of Vancity would be able to take the position that Vancity was not bound by the Agreement with the result that Vancity would be more attractive to a wider range of potential buyers such as other insurance companies.</P>
<P>17. In or about mid May 2009, Vancity told the plaintiffs that a purchaser had been chosen which was not the plaintiffs' bidder, and Vancity was working to finalize the terms of an agreement of purchase and sale with that purchaser but would not disclose to the Plaintiffs who the purchaser was or the business it was in, and represented falsely that it did not know what the purchaser would do with the Insurance Program, when it knew that Co-operators would or would likely become the exclusive carrier under the Insurance Program in place of the plaintiffs. Nevertheless Vancity continued to do business as usual with the plaintiffs as it had since the summer of 2008. On July 21, 2009 Vancity announced that the purchaser was Co-operators.</P>
<P>18. On September 9, 2009 Federated wrote to CNS to say that one of its subsidiaries (&ldquo;<UNDER>708-Canada</UNDER>&rdquo;) had purchased Vancity. Federated <UNDER>or 708-Canada</UNDER> had by September 1, 2009 closed the purchase of Vancity and one or both of them had control of the shares of Vancity by that point and Vancity was required to act as Federated, <UNDER>708- Canada</UNDER> and ultimately Co-operators determined. On September 9, 2009 Federated gave notice to CNS inter alia that all policies with effective dates of September 1, 2009 and later would be issued under a new broker of record The Co -operators Insurance Agencies. In determining that it would not continue to do business after September 1 2009 with the plaintiffs, Vancity breached the Agreement and was induced to do so by Federated's<UNDER>, 708- Canada's</UNDER> and Co-operators' orders that Vancity would use Cooperators as the carrier of the Insurance Program, in place of the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>19. In the alternative, Vancity and VCU conspired each with the other, in or around the fall of 2008, to misrepresent their true intentions and to mislead the plaintiffs into believing that the Agreement was going to be memorialized in writing so that they could enjoy the benefits of the plaintiffs' continuing to perform the Agreement and, among other things, continuing to issue insurance policies on existing customers' renewals or for new customers, thus maintaining and expanding Vancity's customer base which would attract a higher price from a prospective purchaser. In furtherance of the conspiracy, each did the following overt acts:
<P1>(a) VCU directed Vancity to take the actions set out below;</P1>
<P1>(b) Vancity represented that it was business as usual under the Insurance Program and conducted itself accordingly to give and maintain that false impression;</P1>
<P1>(c) Vancity continued to deal with the plaintiffs in the same way it had since the summer of 2008;</P1>
<P1>(d) Vancity worked with the plaintiffs to further refine claims handling procedures in early 2009;</P1>
<P1>(e) Vancity misrepresented to the plaintiffs that the reason the memorialization of the Agreement was proceeding as slowly as it had been, was that the &lsquo;the wheels of commerce are slow here&rsquo;, when the true reason was that Vancity and VCU were stalling to keep what they, mistakenly, believed would keep their options open to attract other insurers to purchase Vancity and enhance the purchase price available, by not having a written memorialization of the Agreement in place.</P1></P>
<P>20. In or around the spring of 2009, Federated, Co-Operators, and <UNDER>708-Canada</UNDER> (collectively &ldquo;the Co-operators Group&rdquo;) joined the above conspiracy and conspired with and amongst each member of the Co-operators Group as well as Vancity and VCU. The objects of this conspiracy now were to continue to maintain the foregoing pleaded illusions of normal business under the Insurance Program and continue to misrepresent the true intentions of the conspirators, by maintaining the false illusion that it would be business as usual and that Vancity would continue to perform under the Agreement, so that the conspirators could maintain Vancity's customer base until the closing of the sale of Vancity to the Co-operators Group which was successfully completed on or about September 1, 2009. In furtherance of this conspiracy, Vancity, VCU, and the Co-operators Group performed the following overt acts:
<P1>(a) VCU and the Co-operators Group directed Vancity to take the actions set out below;</P1>
<P1>(b) Vancity continued to act as pleaded in paragraphs 19(b) and (c) above.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>DAMAGES</TI>
<P>21. As a result of the conspiracies and other conduct pleaded earlier, the plaintiffs suffered damages as hereafter pleaded including staffing and technology expenses and loss of income from the ending of their participation in the Insurance Program, and the lack of ability to market an insurance product line in British Columbia to others on an exclusive basis, by reason of its exclusivity of supply under the Insurance Program with Vancity. By reason of the conduct earlier pleaded, the plaintiffs have suffered the following damages:

<P>22. The conduct of the defendants as earlier pleaded was high-handed, reprehensible and deliberately undertaken in reckless and complete disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs so as to advance and further the economic and business interests of the defendants and as such is deserving of a substantial award of punitive damages in light of the substantial size of the assets of the defendants which are in excess of seven billion dollars.</P>
<P>23. The damages suffered as earlier pleaded by the plaintiffs were sustained in Ontario, the Agreement was made in Ontario as the communication of the acceptance by Vancity of the plaintiffs' offer, earlier pleaded was received in Ontario by the plaintiff Royal, the breaches of the Agreement earlier pleaded made impossible performance of the Agreement that concerned the issuance of policies of insurance by the plaintiffs which was to occur in both Ontario and British Columbia, the earlier pleaded torts of conspiracy and misrepresentation were committed in Ontario by the defendant VC U, which is in any event a necessary or proper party to this proceeding brought against Co&mdash;operators, 242-Canada, Federated and <UNDER>708- Canada.</UNDER> The plaintiffs rely on Rule 17-02(f)(g)(h)(o) of the Rules of Civil Procedure in support of service of the Notice of Action and this Statement of Claim outside of Ontario.</P>
<P>The plaintiffs propose that this action be tried in the City of Toronto.</P>

<FREEFORM>
<BLOCK1><TI>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE OF 2421593 CANADA INC. AND VANCOUVER CITY SAVINGS CREDIT UNION</TI>
<P>1. The Defendants 2421593 Canada Inc. (formerly Vancity Insurance Services Ltd.) (&ldquo;VISL&rdquo;) and Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (&ldquo;Vancity&rdquo;) (together, the &ldquo;Vancity Defendants&rdquo;) admit none of the allegations contained in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>2. The Vancity Defendants deny the allegations contained in paragraphs 1, 5, 7 and 9&ndash;23 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. The Vancity Defendants have no or insufficient knowledge concerning the allegations contained in paragraphs 2&ndash;4, 6 and 8 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>4. Vancity is a credit union governed by the <EM>Credit Union Incorporation Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 82. Until September 1, 2009, VISL was a wholly owned subsidiary of Vancity in the business of insurance brokerage.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Relationship Between VISL and CNS/RSA</TI>
<P>5. In or about October 1998, VISL and the Plaintiff Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company (&ldquo;CNS&rdquo;) entered into an agreement entitled &ldquo;Broker Agreement&rdquo;, by which VISL agreed to offer insurance policies underwritten by CNS to VISL's clients on a non-exclusive basis.</P>
<P>6. In or about August 2004, VISL and the Plaintiff Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Company of Canada (&ldquo;RSA&rdquo;) entered into an agreement entitled &ldquo;Broker Agreement&rdquo; by which VISL agreed to offer insurance policies underwritten by RSA to VISL's clients on a non-exclusive basis.</P>
<P>7. In or about January 2008, CNS became a wholly owned subsidiary of RSA, following which CNS and RSA often acted jointly in their dealings with VISL.</P>
<P>8. In or about March 2008, VISL sent a document (the &ldquo;RFI&rdquo;) entitled &ldquo;Request for Interest&rdquo; to CNS, inviting CNS to express its interest in entering into a business alliance respecting VISL's &ldquo;personal lines&rdquo; portfolio (an &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;). VISL sent a similar document to other insurers, several of which (the &ldquo;Other Insurers&rdquo;) responded with expressions of interest.</P>
<P>9. Also in or about March 2008, CNS and RSA responded to the RFI, requesting &ldquo;investigative due diligence and discussion&rdquo;. CNS and RSA proposed that the parties &ldquo;jointly sign a non-binding Letter of Intent that will allow [the parties] to enter exclusive detailed negotiations ..., the outcome of which will be a full legal contract with a 5-year tenure&rdquo;.</P>
<P>10. In or about [May 2008], VISL sent a document (the &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo;) entitled &ldquo;Proof of Concept Guidelines&rdquo; to CNS and RSA. VISL sent a similar document to the Other Insurers.</P>
<P>11. The Guidelines stated that VISL required additional information and did not at that time intend to make any agreement regarding an Alliance:
<QUOTE><P>The intent of this next stage is not to finalize or reach definitive agreement on these items but rather to achieve a fuller understanding of the requirements, work effort, workflow, timeline, and partnership expectations if the parties were to proceed with the proposed program.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. In or about June 2008, CNS and RSA sent a document (the &ldquo;Discussion Paper&rdquo;) entitled &ldquo;Discussion Paper&rdquo; to VISL, by which CNS and RSA outlined some potential aspects of an Alliance. The Discussion Paper confirmed that the parties had not made any agreement regarding an Alliance and that the essential terms of any agreement in that regard, including as to commissions and termination, remained to be negotiated.</P>
<P>13. Subsequently, VISL decided to focus its attention on entering into an Alliance with CNS and RSA, to the exclusion of the Other Insurers, and began meeting with CNS and RSA to negotiate the terms an agreement in that regard and to discuss how an Alliance might be implemented.</P>
<P>14. Pending the making of an agreement regarding an Alliance, VISL continued to offer insurance policies underwritten by CNS and RSA to VISL's clients. VISL also continued to offer insurance policies underwritten by other insurers to VISL's clients.</P>
<P>15. On December 1, 2008, CNS sent VISL a draft agreement between VISL and CNS regarding an Alliance (the &ldquo;Draft Alliance Agreement&rdquo;), under cover of a letter from CNS describing it as &ldquo;the first draft&rdquo;. The Draft Alliance Agreement
<P1>(a) contained drafting &ldquo;bullets&rdquo; to indicate missing text;</P1>
<P1>(b) omitted several of its Schedules; and</P1>
<P1>(c) included the heading &ldquo;Draft for Discussion Purposes&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>16. In or about February 2009, Vancity offered its shareholding in VISL for sale to various insurers, including RSA. RSA, and thus CNS, knew or ought to have known that Vancity's shareholding in VISL, if not purchased by RSA, could be purchased by a competing insurer, in which case VISL would likely not make an agreement regarding an Alliance.</P>
<P>17. By no later than May 25, 2009, RSA, and thus CNS, learned that Vancity had indeed agreed to sell its shareholding in VISL to a third party, which Vancity later publicly announced to be the Defendant The Co-operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-operators&rdquo;).</P>
<P>18. On September 1, 2009, through its wholly owned subsidiary, 7081332 Canada Ltd., Co-operators acquired Vancity's shareholding in VISL, following which VISL ceased to procure insurance services from CNS and RSA.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>No Breach of Contract, Bad Faith, Misrepresentation or Conspiracy</TI>
<P>19. VISL never made the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;, as defined in the Statement of Claim, or any other agreement forming an Alliance with CNS or RSA.</P>
<P>20. At all material times, VISL negotiated with CNS and RSA in good faith and in a commercially reasonably manner, and did not engage in any misrepresentation.</P>
<P>21. The Vancity Defendants specifically deny having entered into any conspiracy with each other or other of the Defendants, as alleged in the Statement of Claim or at all</P>
<P>22. The Vancity Defendants specifically deny having engaged in any high-handed or reprehensible conduct, as alleged in the Statement of Claim or at all.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>No Damages</TI>
<P>23. The Vancity Defendants deny that CNS and RSA have suffered any of the damages alleged in the Statement of Claim and put CNS and RSA to the strict proof thereof. If CNS and RSA have suffered any of the damages alleged, which is not admitted but specifically denied, such damages were caused by no act or omission for which the Vancity Defendants are legally responsible.</P>
<P>24. Additionally, the damages alleged in the Statement of Claim are excessive, duplicative and remote and CNS and RSA have failed to mitigate them.</P>
<P>25. The Vancity Defendants therefore request that this action be dismissed against them with costs.</P>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF VANCOUVER CITY SAVINGS CREDIT UNION AND 2421593 CANADA INC.</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This is a case about business people getting ahead of themselves. In their excitement over a proposed business venture, they lost sight of the need to agree on clear and definite contract terms. In the end, no contract was signed, clear and definite terms were never agreed orally, and one of the parties decided to go in a different direction. The (spumed) counterparty now claims that there was a legally enforceable contract as of a date early in the parties' discussions&mdash;even though the parties continued to negotiate for months, and continued to disagree on material terms including compensation. Despite the lack of any written agreement and the months-long discussions about the terms of the proposed arrangement, is the spumed counterparty correct that a legally enforceable contract was formed?</P>
<P>2. Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (&ldquo;<BOLD>Vancity</BOLD>&rdquo;) is a Vancouver-based financial institution. Until September 2009, it owned Vancity Insurance Services Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Vancity Insurance</BOLD>&rdquo;),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Vancity Insurance is now known as 2421593 Canada Inc.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which was an insurance broker offering auto and property insurance policies primarily to Vancity customers.</P>
<P>3. In 2008, Vancity Insurance engaged in discussions with Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company and Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Company of Canada (&ldquo;<BOLD>CNS and RSA</BOLD>&rdquo;) towards an arrangement whereby CNS and RSA would become the sole supplier of insurance products to Vancity Insurance. Discussions proceeded for several months, but eventually ended when Vancity decided to sell Vancity Insurance to The Co-Operators Group Limited, Federated Agencies Limited and 7081332 Canada Ltd. (collectively, &ldquo;<BOLD>Co-Operators</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. The main issue in this case is whether the arrangement between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA proceeded to the point of a legally enforceable contract.</P>
<P>5. There is no dispute that no written contract was ever signed: a first draft was circulated in December 2008, but matters never proceeded to the point of a final draft much less an executed agreement. There is also no dispute that there were protracted discussions between the parties, and that a considerable amount of operational work was done by the parties to enable CNS and RSA to become the sole supplier to Vancity Insurance. Where the parties differ is on the question of whether a legally enforceable contract arose on the basis of the parties' oral discussions.</P>
<P>6. Specifically, CNS and RSA point to one specific meeting, held on July 3, 2008, as the point at which they claim a legally enforceable contract arose. Does careful scrutiny of the July 3, 2008 meeting support the contention that a legally enforceable contract was formed on that date?</P>
<P>7. It does not. The parties continued their contract discussions for months thereafter, with a major contract meeting on September 11, 2008 and a draft contract provided on December 1, 2008. This reality in itself is a strong indication that a legally enforceable contract did not arise on July 3, 2008. Moreover, significant elements of a very complex proposed commercial arrangement remained unsettled as of July 3, 2008, including such crucial matters as the compensation to be paid under the arrangement.</P>
<P>8. The law is clear that a legally enforceable contract does not arise: (i) where, viewed objectively, essential terms have not been agreed but instead have been left by the parties for future agreement; (ii) where, viewed objectively, the provisions of what has been agreed are insufficiently certain; and (iii) where, viewed objectively, the parties intend that a preliminary agreement is not to create binding contractual relations until a subsequent formal document is executed. Looking at the matter from an objective perspective and not a retrospective subjective viewpoint (in other words, the perspective that is mandated by law), all three of these circumstances are present.</P>
<P>9. In addition to the main contract claim, CNS and RSA assert an alternative claim that there was a conspiracy between Vancity/Vancity Insurance and Co-Operators. This claim can be easily dismissed. There is no evidence whatsoever of a conspiracy. Vancity and Co-Operators engaged in a <EM>bona fide</EM>, arm's length commercial transaction by which Vancity Insurance was sold by Vancity to Co-Operators. It was a straightforward commercial transaction, not a conspiracy.</P>
<P>10. Summary judgment ought therefore to be granted dismissing the action.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Early discussions: February 29, 2008 to June 26, 2008</TI>
<P>11. On February 29, 2008, Vancity Insurance issued a request for interest (the &ldquo;<BOLD>RFI</BOLD>&rdquo;) asking a number of insurers to express their interest in developing an exclusive supplier arrangement with Vancity Insurance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Request for Interest; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, pp. 10&ndash;24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> CNS and RSA responded to the RFI, through a document dated March 2008 and entitled &ldquo;Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, pp. 25&ndash;47.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. Following the submission by CNS and RSA of the &ldquo;Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition&rdquo; document, there were some initial conversations between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA. These were very conceptual, high-level discussions that took place over coffee. At this stage, there was no discussion about contract terms, the length of the arrangement, or compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Examination for discovery of Tony Hayes (&ldquo;<BOLD>Hayes Discovery</BOLD>&rdquo;), Q90-Q91; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, p. 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no dispute that there was no legally enforceable contract at this stage.</P>
<P>13. Importantly, the &ldquo;Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition&rdquo; document set out the manner in which the proposed transaction would be undertaken: the parties would first enter into a non-binding letter of intent, followed by approximately six weeks of exclusive detailed negotiations, followed at that point by a &ldquo;full legal contract&rdquo; with a five year term.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, p. 44; Hayes Discovery, Q93&ndash;Q98; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, pp. 52&ndash;54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. From the outset, it was apparent to both parties that the proposed arrangement was complex and unique. As Tony Hayes, a representative of CNS and RSA, testified at his examination for discovery: &ldquo;this was quite different from any other deal we had ever done before&rdquo; because &ldquo;[i]t was large. It was multi-insurer portfolio rollover. And it was non-traditional. So it wasn't a traditional broker/insurer relationship. It was more of a partnership to build a product for them. So it wasn't&mdash;it wasn't typical.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q99 to Q102; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2B, pp. 54-55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. On June 10, 2008, Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA had a meeting at which CNS and RSA presented a proof of concept document entitled &ldquo;Beyond the RFI ... Experiencing Partnership&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Confidential Discussion Paper, &ldquo;Beyond the RFI ... Experiencing Partnership&rdquo;; Motion Vancity, Tab 2C, pp. 56&ndash;123.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Up to this stage, discussion of contract terms was limited,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q152&ndash;Q157; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2C, pp. 126&ndash;128.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> there was no agreement on commission rates to be paid to CNS and RSA,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q158&ndash;Q166; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2C, pp. 128&ndash;130.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and there was no agreement on the business and operating model.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q167&ndash;Q169; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2C, p. 130.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. On June 26, 2008, Glen Pentland of Vancity Insurance informed Ken Keenan of CNS and RSA that they had been &ldquo;selected to enter exclusive negotiations to become their sole insurer&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email dated June 26, 2008 from Ken Keenan to others at CNS and RSA; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2D, p. 131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no dispute between the parties that &ldquo;at this point there is no deal in place, this is just the start of exclusive negotiations towards a deal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q172; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2D, p. 133.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The July 3, 2008 meeting</TI>
<P>17. A key meeting was held on July 3, 2008. At Mr. Hayes' examination for discovery on behalf of CNS and RSA on March 25, 2014, CNS and RSA were unable to identify the point at which they believed a legally enforceable contract had been formed with Vancity Insurance and took the question under advisement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q606; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2P, p. 277.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A year later, when CNS and RSA served their affidavits in response to this summary judgment motion, they identified the July 3, 2008 meeting as the point at which they now claim a legally enforceable contract was formed. Accordingly, it is important to scrutinize carefully exactly what was agreed at the July 3, 2008 meeting, the certainty of what was agreed, what was left for future determination, and whether as at July 3, 2008 a further formal contract document was contemplated.</P>
<P>18. The parties left the July 3, 2008 meeting with &ldquo;many action items&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) dated July 4, 2008; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2F, p. 151.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These action items included the following:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Meeting Minutes; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2E, pp. 134-135.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>(a) &ldquo;Need to secure a confidentiality agreement (Karen to provide Glen with a sample)&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;RSA/CNS to provide boiler plate contract for review/discussion&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(c) &ldquo;Branded RSA product with Pure Home&mdash;possibly September 1&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(d) &ldquo;Fully branded customized product with Pure home&mdash;January 1&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(e) &ldquo;Scott to approach Keith for availability to come to BC next week to develop new business strategy and processes. This will include evaluation of RSA/CNS's current competitiveness, identifying gaps (and pricing dislocation) and accommodation options to facilitate new business to RSA/CNS.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(f) &ldquo;Will need process in place to immediately identify any challenges with accepting new business and resolution procedures.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(g) &ldquo;Beckie to scope timing, requirements and Bravado availability for the roll-over process.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(h) &ldquo;Karen to explore Inventure's (Vancity IT Group) availability for rollover support and portfolio transfer analysts&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>(i) &ldquo;RSA/CNS will hire a project manager for this project.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>19. At this point, commission rates had not yet been set, and many operational issues remained to be worked out.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q188-Q189; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2E, p. 141.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. From this point onwards, discussions between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA proceeded on two parallel tracks: (i) a contract track, which was designed to address contract terms and move to a written agreement; and (ii) an operational track, which addressed moving over existing business to CNS and RSA, dealing with gaps in product and price, and developing the new product that would be marketed jointly by Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA (which would be known as Vancity BOB).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q217&ndash;Q219; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2E, pp. 149-150.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. After the July 3, 2008 meeting, there were no material discussions on contract terms until a further meeting on September 11, 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q265; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2G, p. 155.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The September 11, 2008 contract meeting</TI>
<P>22. On the contract track, Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA had a meeting on September 11, 2008 to discuss contract terms. In light of the claim CNS and RSA now assert that a legally enforceable contract was already in place as of July 3, 2008, it is interesting to ask why the parties were bothering to have a meeting to contract terms, and to consider what was actually discussed at the September 11, 2008 contract meeting and what the open issues still were both going into and coming out of that meeting.</P>
<P>23. Prior to the September 11, 2008 contract meeting, CNS and RSA had an internal discussion to discuss their negotiating position with Vancity Insurance in the upcoming discussions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q276; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2H, p. 159.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Again, one should query why a negotiating position was needed if, as CNS and RSA now contend, a legally enforceable contract had been in place since July 3, 2008. Those internal discussions within CNS and RSA &ldquo;were around exclusivity, they were around all of the things that we've kind of discussed, the five-year term, the two-year cancellation. We talked about SLA, or Service Level Agreements, for both claims and underwriting. Those are all things that are not in a standard contract.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q272; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2H, p. 158.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At this point, the SLAs had not been agreed with Vancity Insurance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q275; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2H, p. 159.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Vancity Insurance prepared a document dated September 8, 2008 setting out the issues to be discussed at the September 11, 2008 meeting (the &ldquo;<BOLD>September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 160.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document was provided to CNS and RSA in advance of the meeting, and is very telling in terms of the contention that CNS and RSA now advance that a legally enforceable contract was already in place.</P>
<P>25. Contrary to the claim that CNS and RSA now advance that a legally enforceable contract was already in place, the September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document begins with a plan to enter into a non-binding letter of intent:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>1.</N><TI>&lsquo;Spirit and Intent&rsquo; Partnership Agreement</TI>
<P>Develop a one to two page document that summarizes the &lsquo;spirit and intent&rsquo; of the partnership and is signed by Ken and Terry. <BOLD><EM>This is a non-legal document that will summarize the vision, spirit and intent of the partnership</EM>.</BOLD>
<ITEM><P>Identify the vision, values, goals and expectations of the partnership.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Identify how the partnership will move beyond the traditional supplier-broker relationship</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Identify the triple-bottom line commitment and opportunities to drive community leadership through the partnership</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Commit to have joint performance targets (KPIs) and joint strategies to achieve the targets</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Confirm willingness of insurer to obtain financial services from Vancity&rdquo; [Emphasis added.]</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document then addresses the need for a &ldquo;Three Year Strategic Plan&rdquo; and the need to &ldquo;identify&rdquo; a number of parameters of the arrangement between the parties:
<QUOTE><P><ITEM><P><BOLD><EM>Identify</EM></BOLD> three year and annual growth targets and KPIs</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD><EM>Identify</EM></BOLD> strategies to achieve these targets</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD><EM>Identify</EM></BOLD> strategies for community leadership [Emphasis added.]</P></ITEM></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. Representing the unique nature of the proposed arrangement, the September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document makes it clear that the contract that was under contemplation was bespoke and not something off-the-shelf: &ldquo;Start with an existing insurer/broker contract and identify contractual requirements that differ from the standard Company-Broker Agreement (RSA may have examples of other agreements to work from)&rdquo;.</P>
<P>28. The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document makes clear that an agreement was required in respect of certain technology costs:
<QUOTE><P><ITEM><P>Who pays for changing technology requirements</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Who pays for IT transitional costs over year one, two and three.</P></ITEM></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document contemplated a nondisclosure/confidentiality agreement and a privacy agreement, but did not set out any terms for either one:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI>Confidentiality/Privacy</TI>
<P><ITEM><P>Non-disclosure confidentiality agreements included as addendum to contract</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Privacy agreement.</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document noted the need for a &ldquo;[c]laims process for Vancity&rdquo;, the need to &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>identify</EM></BOLD> auditing procedures, responsibilities, timing, reporting&rdquo; [emphasis added], the need to &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>identify</EM></BOLD> mechanisms for remuneration assessment&rdquo; [emphasis added].</P>
<P>31. In stark contrast to the claim that CNS and RSA now assert that there was a legally enforceable contract in place already, the September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document makes it clear that commission rates were not yet settled and contemplates further negotiations on the point:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI>Profit-sharing</TI>
<P><ITEM><P>Increase from current 1-2% to <BOLD><EM>up to</EM></BOLD> 5% (<BOLD><EM>CNS proposal</EM></BOLD>)</P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P><BOLD><EM>Need to identify creative ways to structure commission and profit sharing</EM></BOLD> to support growth and underwriting objectives. [Emphasis added.]</P></ITEM></P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. The September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document made it quite clear that much work remained to be done on SLAs:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>4.</N><TI>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</TI>
<P><BOLD><EM>Identify</EM></BOLD> key service level agreement terms and performance standards. This <BOLD><EM>could be</EM></BOLD> an addendum to the contract or a separate agreement that is updated as required.

<P>33. With respect to these various items, Mr. Hayes confirmed the following on his examination for discovery:
<P1>(a) It was in fact contemplated in September 2008 that there would be a one-to two-page non-binding spirit and intent document.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q280; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 163.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No such document was ever actually drafted, much less signed.</P1>
<P1>(b) As of September 2008 there was no agreement on three year and annual growth targets and KPIs. Indeed, at no point was there ever agreement on these points.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q283-Q284; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 164.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) As of September 2008 there were no technology service agreements in place. Indeed, they were never put in place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q304-Q305; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 169.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(d) As of September 2008 there was no agreement in place with respect to who would pay IT transitional costs in the second and third years of the relationship.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q309-Q310; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 170.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(e) Mr. Hayes did not know if there had been agreement that confidentiality agreements would be included as an addendum to the contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q312; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, pp. 170-171.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(f) As of September 2008 a claims promise for Vancity Insurance had not been agreed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q315; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 171.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(g) As of September 2008 there had been no agreement on who would pay for marketing support.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q438; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, p. 178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(h) As of September 2008 there had been no agreement on key performance measurement criteria, or on the consequences of non-performance, or key service level agreement terms, or performance standards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q369-Q370 and Q373-q374; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, pp. 182&ndash;184.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(i) As of September 2008 the details of the termination provisions had not been agreed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q410; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2I, pp. 186-187.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>34. The minutes of the September 11, 2008 contract meeting confirm the inconclusive nature of the arrangements at the time, and add another point of uncertainty: &ldquo;need to agree on rollout dates&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Minutes of September 11, 2008 meeting; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2J, p. 188.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mr. Hayes confirmed on discovery that as of September 2008 there had not yet even been agreement on when the new Vancity BOB product would be rolled out.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q413; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2J, pp. 190-191.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The December 1, 2008 &ldquo;solid first draft&rdquo; contract</TI>
<P>35. The contract discussions next advanced on December 1, 2008, when CNS and RSA forwarded to Vancity Insurance a &ldquo;first draft of the Vancity/CNS contract&rdquo;, noting that they hoped it would &ldquo;serve as a solid first draft for us to work on.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>December 1, 2008 letter from Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) to Terry Taciuk (Vancity Insurance); Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, p. 204.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. The &ldquo;solid first draft&rdquo; was accompanied by a letter that set out the views of CNS and RSA on what compensation should be: &ldquo;With regard to compensation, I thought it best that we outline how we see the various levels of compensation under the new partnership agreement.&rdquo; It further provided that transaction commissions on new business would rise to 23% and then further to 25%, but at some unknown future date: &ldquo;Once we have a fully formed Vancity proposition in 2009, we will of course set a date to move to the 25% commission levels as per the original proposal.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD><EM>Ibid.</EM></BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. Mr. Hayes confirmed on discovery that the December 1, 2008 draft contract &ldquo;wasn't a document [he] expected Vancity just to sign, [he] expected this to be a solid first draft to work on with Vancity.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q534; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, p,. 253.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. While Mr. Hayes asserted on discovery that some of the compensation points he referred to in his covering letter were agreed, he admitted that not all were: &ldquo;Parts of it are already in play, parts are not.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q537; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, p. 254.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Mr. Hayes confirmed on discovery that a number of the provisions in the draft December 1, 2008 contract had not been agreed with Vancity Insurance. Schedule C provided for several matters that had not been agreed with Vancity Insurance, and Schedule D was entirely blank.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q550&ndash;Q563; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, pp. 257&ndash;260.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Schedule E contemplated a commission schedule that had not been agreed, and Schedule G had an incomplete chart on service levels because there had not yet been agreement on those service levels.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q564&ndash;Q567; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, pp. 260-261.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. The reaction of Glen Pentland of Vancity Insurance to the draft December 1, 2008 contract was &ldquo;I think it is close&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) to Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) dated December 11, 2008 at 4:52 p.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2M, p. 262.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On discovery, Mr. Hayes acknowledged that he understood at the time that this meant that &ldquo;there were still open issues to be discussed&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Discovery, Q574-Q575; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2M, p. 266.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. Mr. Hayes followed up on the draft December 1, 2008 contract by asking whether the parties were &ldquo;on the same page&rdquo; with respect to compensation rates:
<QUOTE><P>Have you had a chance to look at the memo outlining compensation? <BOLD><EM>Just want to make sure that we are all on the same page to avoid any confusion</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>The memo outlines the payments as being seperated [<EM>sic</EM>] by rollover bonus of 5%, new business commission at 23% but does not anticipate moving the rollover business until renewal into the full program product next year.</P>
<P><BOLD><EM>Does this fit with your understanding as well</EM>?</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) to Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) dated December 11, 2008 at 11:27 a.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2M, p. 262.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>42. Mr. Pentland's response to this query revealed that the parties were not in fact &ldquo;on the same page&rdquo;: &ldquo;Somewhere I had understood it would be 25% for new business beginning December 1 as CNS would be our sole supplier at the time for new business.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) to Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) dated December 11, 2008 at 4:52 p.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2M, p. 262.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Further confusion about compensation rates</TI>
<P>43. Further email exchanges in January 2009&mdash;allegedly four months after a legally enforceable contract was in place (according to the position now asserted by CNS and RSA)&mdash;reveal that there was considerable confusion and disagreement about compensation levels. On January 6, 2009, Mr. Pentland of Vancity Insurance wrote to Mr. Hayes of CNS and RSA to acknowledge that &ldquo;[t]here may have been some misunderstanding on the amounts for payments&rdquo; and stated that &ldquo;I need to be sure we are all agreed&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) to Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) dated January 3:57 p.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2N, p. 267.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In response, Mr. Hayes did not agree with Mr. Pentland's understanding but instead said, &ldquo;I think its [<EM>sic</EM>] a good idea if we sit down and make sure we are all on the same page and crystal clear to avoid confusion. ... I don't think we are far off the mark but there are a few things we need to discuss as we move from 20% up to an enhanced commission.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) to Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) dated January 7, 2009 at 8:26 p.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2N, p. 267.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. The parties then met to discuss the point, which was followed by an email in which Vancity Insurance set out what it understood the compensation model to be: &ldquo;As discussed, we see the compensation model during this phase as follows.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) to Glen Pentland (Vancity Insurance) dated January 9, 2009 at 4:17 p.m.; Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2O, p. 273.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The contract is never signed</TI>
<P>45. The &ldquo;solid first draft&rdquo; never proceeded any further. No contract was ever signed. In the spring of 2009, Vancity decided to sell Vancity Insurance to The Co-operators, and discussions between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA ceased. After the sale closed in September 2009, this lawsuit followed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The response of CNS and RSA to this motion</TI>
<P>46. Mr. Hayes was examined for discovery on March 25, 2014. Two months later, on June 23, 2014, Vancity and Vancity Insurance served this motion for summary judgment. CNS and RSA then took nearly a year to serve their responding materials, and came up with three affidavits&mdash;by Mr. Hayes sworn June 10, 2015, by Glen Pentland sworn June 17, 2015, and by Keith Mottram sworn June 18, 2015.</P>
<P>47. All three of the responding affidavits were clearly very carefully crafted&mdash;no doubt by CNS and RSA's counsel over the full year that they took to come up with them&mdash;to attempt to paint a picture very different than that painted by the documents and by Mr. Hayes' examination for discovery, specifically that of a fully concluded deal. Given how long it took for CNS and RSA to create the three responding affidavits and how different a picture they paint than the documentary evidence and the discovery evidence of Mr. Hayes in March 2014, the three responding affidavits should be scrutinized carefully. They do not withstand careful scrutiny, and ought to be rejected.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The evidence of Keith Mottram</TI>
<P>48. The easiest one to deal with is the evidence of Mr. Mottram. Mr. Mottram worked for CNS and RSA and had responsibility for managing the transfer, or &ldquo;rollover&rdquo;, of insurance business from Vancity Insurance's other insurers to CNS and RSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Keith Mottram (&ldquo;<BOLD>Mottram Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;), para. 1; Responding Motion Record of CNS and RSA, Vol. IV, Tab C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The punch line of Mr. Mottram's evidence is that he believed there was a full commitment between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA, and that there was nothing contingent about the arrangement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Mottram Affidavit, para. 27; Responding Motion Record of CNS and RSA, Vol. IV, Tab C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> But the cross-examination of Mr. Mottram revealed that this belief has no probative value because of Mr. Mottram's role.</P>
<P>49. On cross-examination, Mr. Mottram admitted that he had no involvement in the response of CNS and RSA to the RFI, and in fact was not even aware that the response document was being created at the time it was prepared.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Cross-examination of Keith Mottram (&ldquo;<BOLD>Mottram Cross-Examination</BOLD>&rdquo;), Q38-Q39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, he was not involved in the meeting between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA to discuss the proposal document of CNS and RSA, and was not even aware at the time of the existence of either the document or the meeting.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mottram Cross-Examination, Q46&ndash;Q48.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He was not among the large group of individuals at CNS and RSA who were informed on June 26, 2008 that CNS and RSA had been selected by Vancity Insurance to enter into exclusive negotiations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mottram Cross-Examination, Q49&ndash;Q53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. Mr. Mottram accepted the characterization of Mr. Hayes on his discovery that after the July 3, 2008 meeting there were two tracks of discussions between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA, namely a contract track and an operational track. Crucially, he admitted that <BOLD><EM>all of his work was on the operational track, and that he was not even aware at that time that the contract track existed</EM></BOLD>:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mottram Cross-Examination, Q59&ndash;63.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Q. Okay. And you will agree with me that, put in these terms, that put your work on the operational track, as Mr. Hayes put it?</P>
<P>A. That would be correct, yes. It was certainly an operational activity.</P>
<P>Q. Right. And on the contract track, the other track, dealing with the contract terms of Vancity, that was not the track that you were involved with? You were on the operational track?</P>
<P>A. <BOLD><EM>I wasn't involved in the contract at all</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>Q. Right. And <BOLD><EM>were you even aware that there were these contract discussions going on on the side at the same time</EM>?</BOLD></P>
<P>A. <BOLD><EM>No</EM>.</BOLD> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>51. Every single one of the meetings Mr. Mottram lists in his affidavit were on the operational track, with no discussion of the contract at any of the meetings Mr. Mottram attended.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mottram Cross-Examination, Q80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. The reality that the contract track and the operational track operated entirely independently of one another&mdash;with Mr. Mottram having no involvement in the contract track and no knowledge of anything that was taking place on it&mdash;is best illustrated by the fact that on September 11, 2008 there were meetings on both tracks, specifically the September 11, 2008 contract meeting described above, and a separate operational meeting/call in which Mr. Mottram participated. Mr. Mottram did not even know that a contract meeting was taking place on the same day as his operational meeting.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mottram Cross-Examination, Q84&ndash;Q91.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. Accordingly, Mr. Mottram's beliefs are easily discounted. He had no visibility whatsoever into the contracting process. He was tasked with an operational exercise that sheds no light on whether there was sufficient certainty of agreement on essential terms. Mr. Mottram's evidence is irrelevant to the issue that is before the court.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The evidence of Glen Pentland</TI>
<P>54. Next it becomes necessary to consider the evidence of Mr. Pentland. At the time of the events in question Mr. Pentland was employed by Vancity Insurance. Upon the sale of Vancity Insurance, he became an employee of Co-Operators. While Mr. Pentland's affidavit attempts to portray certainty of terms as between Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA, his cross-examination revealed a very different picture.</P>
<P>55. On cross-examination, Mr. Pentland agreed that coming out of the July 3, 2008 meeting&mdash;the meeting at which CNS and RSA now claim that a legally enforceable contract was formed&mdash;&ldquo;there were many action items that needed to be worked on as the partnership, as you put it, was put in place&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Cross-examination of Glen Pentland (&ldquo;<BOLD>Pentland Cross-Examination</BOLD>&rdquo;), page 8, lines 5&ndash;10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Included among the issues that needed to be resolved were a confidentiality agreement (which was important to Vancity because of privacy concerns) and considerable operational work.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 8, line 19 to page 9, line 19; page 10, line 14 to page 11, line 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. Mr. Pentland admitted that at the time of the September 11, 2008 contract discussions, Vancity Insurance was contemplating a one- or two-page non-binding document that would guide the discussions towards the final contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 19, line 18 to page 21, line 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Going into the September 11, 2008 meeting &ldquo;there was nothing yet in writing agreed by both sides as to what the vision, values, goal and expectations of the partnership would be&rdquo;: &ldquo;there were some agreements that were made and some agreements still outstanding. But the need to get it onto paper.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 22, line 12 to page 23, line 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Included among the items that Mr. Pentland wanted this document&mdash;which did not yet exist&mdash;to include were: (i) a commitment to joint performance targets, or KPIs; (ii) the specific KPIs; (iii) the consequences in terms of compensation flowing from the KPIs; and (iv) specific growth targets over the first three years of the arrangement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 23, line 9 to page 24, line 14 and page 26, lines 5&ndash;9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>57. Aside from the letter of intent document, Mr. Pentland admitted that a formal contract would have to be specifically negotiated: &ldquo;[t]here was no agreement just off the shelf that would fit this unique arrangement&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 28, lines 12&ndash;16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. Mr. Pentland admitted on cross-examination that going into the September 11, 2008 meeting, Vancity Insurance wanted a two-year notice period for termination of the arrangement. That point had been discussed but not yet agreed:
<QUOTE><P>Q. But that was still an open issue that needed to be confirmed or agreed at the September 11, 2008 meeting?</P>
<P>A. I think we&mdash;I mean, in my view we had fairly strong assurances from Ken Keenan directly in terms of where we were going. Was it written down? No. Was it clearly two years? No.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Penland Cross-Examination, page 28, line 23 to page 29, line 8 and page 30, lines 5&ndash;11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>59. Other open items going into the September 11, 2008 meeting were who would pay for IT transitional costs; auditing procedures, responsibilities, timing and reporting; profit sharing for growth; a contingency plan and disaster response in case of a major disaster in the lower mainland of B.C.; and service level terms and performance standards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pentland Cross-Examination, page 31, lines 7&ndash;16; page 32, line 20 to page 33, line 6; page 34, line 16 to page 35, line 10; page 35, line15 to page 36, line 8; and page 36, lines 9&ndash;22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. When carefully scrutinized, Mr. Pentland's evidence does not support the contention that a legally enforceable contract was formed on July 3, 2008. Too many essential terms remained outstanding as at September 11, 2008, much less at July 3, 2008.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The evidence of Mr. Hayes</TI>
<P>61. The evidence of Mr. Hayes in response to this motion attempts to do a remarkable thing, namely resile from the clear picture portrayed by the documents and by Mr. Hayes' own prior examination for discovery evidence. The primary technique used by Mr. Hayes in this effort is to discount his prior evidence and the documents&mdash;even documents he himself created&mdash;as simply &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.</P>
<P>62. On cross-examination, Mr. Hayes frankly admitted that going into the July 3, 2008 contract discussion meeting, it was &ldquo;open season&rdquo; with everything having to be negotiated:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Cross-examination of Tony Hayes (&ldquo;Hayes Cross-Examination&rdquo;), page 7 line 17 to page 8, line 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Q. But at this point there were issues that needed to be discussed with Vancity.</P>
<P>A. Absolutely.</P>
<P>Q. There were lots of issues that needed to be discussed with Vancity.</P>
<P>A. Absolutely.</P>
<P>Q. Including how you were going to do this operationally?</P>
<P>A. Correct.</P>
<P>Q. Including commission levels.</P>
<P>A. Correct.</P>
<P>Q. Including basically everything?</P>
<P>A. Correct.</P>
<P>Q. And <BOLD><EM>so going into the first discussions, which were on July 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, 2008, it was open season. Everything needed to be negotiated</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>A. <BOLD><EM>Correct</EM>.</BOLD> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>63. Mr . Hayes seeks to discount the reference in the documentation surrounding the September 11, 2008 contract discussions to Vancity Insurance wanting a two-year notice period for termination by claiming there was a prior agreement on July 3, 2008 to a one-year notice period, which was changed on September 11, 2008. The difficulty with this theory is that it is entirely unsupported by the documentation, which contains no hint either of an agreement to a one-year notice period or to an amendment to change the notice period to two years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page 33, line 4 to page 34, line 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. Mr. Hayes' document summarizing the issues to be discussed at the September 11, 2008 contract meeting makes no reference to any agreement to increase the commission rate to 23 percent, as Mr. Hayes now claims had already been agreed. He dismisses the lack of documentary evidence of any agreement to a 23 percent commission rate as an &ldquo;error&rdquo; and &ldquo;oversight&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page45, line 19 to page 46, line 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In his affidavit he had said &ldquo;I did not set out the agreement to pay 23 percent on an interim basis as that would not form part of the written contract.&rdquo; When confronted by that statement on cross-examination, he said &ldquo;I'm not sure what I meant by that&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page 46, lines 13&ndash;17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>&mdash;a sure sign that the words of paragraph 61 came from counsel and not the witness. Mr. Hayes then admitted that commission rates would have to be included in a written agreement, but dismissed his own document as an &ldquo;oversight&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>Q. Okay. So you see it as an error not to refer to the 23 percent in your summary document?</P>
<P>A. Yes. Commission would be included in a contract and should have been included in this document. It was just simply an oversight.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>65. Mr. Hayes also discounted his reference to an LOI as an error. He claimed that by September 11, 2008 a letter of intent was no longer necessary, but he had no explanation for his own reference at around that time to an LOI (&ldquo;The LOI would specify service agreements but rather point to the future development of an acceptable SLA&rdquo;) other than to say it was an &ldquo;error&rdquo;: &ldquo;I'm saying that any reference to an LOI was an error. That was the wrong term to use.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page 49, line 18 to page 50, line 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He also sought to dismiss a second reference he made to an LOI as another &ldquo;error&rdquo;:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page 57, lines 1&ndash;12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>Q. So when you say you probably should have, you&mdash;you now think that it was an error that you included it in there?</P>
<P>A. I do. We were&mdash;there was no call for a document, whether you call it a spirit and intent or LOI. We were completely in the midst of the program.</P>
<P>Q. Okay. So you say you made a mistake in referring to that in item 1 and you made a mistake in referring to an LOI at the end of item 4, Have I&mdash;</P>
<P>A. Correct.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. By December 1, 2008, Mr. Hayes claims that there was an agreement to move from an interim 23 percent commission rate to a rate of 25 percent, but only reluctantly admitted on cross-examination that there was never any agreement on the date on which the commission rate would increase, and that the date would require a mutual agreement of Vancity Insurance, CNS and RSA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Cross-Examination, page 65, line 9 to page 67, line 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He later admitted, again reluctantly, that the parties never actually agreed on the date on which the commission rate would increase:
<QUOTE><P>Q. Right. And there never was in fact an agreement on moving to full program, to the 25?</P>
<P>A. Oh, yes.</P>
<P>Q. No, no, no. You never agreed on a specific date when it would move to 25?</P>
<P>A. No. We just agreed that it would move to 25.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>67. No credence should be placed in Mr. Hayes's revised evidence as demonstrated by his responding affidavit. That evidence simply cannot be reconciled with the documentary evidence&mdash;including documents Mr. Hayes himself wrote at the time&mdash;or with Mr. Hayes' unscripted discovery evidence, at which he candidly acknowledged the many issues that were never agreed between the parties. Mr. Hayes' attempts to explain away contradictions between his revised testimony and the documents as multiple &ldquo;errors&rdquo; simply defies belief. The truth is revealed by the documents and by what Mr. Hayes candidly said on discovery. It is not revealed by the responding affidavit that took a year to craft and clearly represents a revisionist view of history.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The conspiracy allegations</TI>
<P>68. No doubt recognizing the weakness in its claim that a legally enforceable contract was formed, CNS and RSA also allege a conspiracy. On Mr. Hayes' discovery they were unable to offer any evidence in support of the alleged conspiracy. None of the affidavits filed in response to this motion offer any evidence either. The conspiracy allegations are clearly unsupported by any evidence and are clearly without merit.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P>69. Was a legally enforceable contract formed on July 3, 2008, as CNS and RSA now allege?</P>
<P>70. Is there any basis for the allegations of a conspiracy?</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;THE LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Preliminary point: there is no impediment to summary judgment</TI>
<P>71. This case fits well within the parameters for summary judgment set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits on a motion for summary judgment. This will be the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result.</P>
<P>These principles are interconnected and all speak to whether summary judgment will provide a fair and just adjudication. When a summary judgment motion allows the judge to find the necessary facts and resolve the dispute, proceeding to trial would generally not be proportionate, timely or cost effective. Similarly, a process that does not give a judge confidence in her conclusions can never be the proportionate way to resolve a dispute. It bears reiterating that the standard for fairness is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the judge confidence that she can find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve the dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><PARANUM>49-50</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>72. Much of the evidence in this case is documentary, and to the extent that findings of fact are necessary they can be made on the basis of the documentary record and the extensive examination for discovery and cross-examinations. The only aspect of the case approaching a credibility issue is Mr. Hayes' about-face between his discovery evidence and his affidavit sworn in response to this motion, but the inconsistencies in his evidence can be resolved by the evidence given on the cross-examination on his affidavit. Moreover, it would be perverse and contrary to principles of proportionality to conclude on the basis of contradictions in the evidence of CNS and RSA's own witness that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The contract issue: the proper approach to the issue</TI>
<P>73. The question of whether a legally enforceable contract has been formed must be determined objectively. The subjective intentions and beliefs of Mr. Hayes, Mr. Pentland and Mr. Mottram are not relevant, and indeed are inadmissible:
<QUOTE><P>A determination as to whether a concluded agreement exists does not depend on an inquiry into the actual state of mind of one of the parties or on the parole evidence of one party's subjective intention.

<P>75. The proper approach to determining whether there is a legally enforceable contract was set out by Cromwell J.A. (as he then was) in <CASEREF><SOC>United Gulf Developments Ltd. v.

<QUOTE><P>The judge sought, as he should, to determine from the perspective of an objective, reasonable bystander, in light of all the material facts, whether the parties intended to contract and whether the essential terms of that contract could be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty: see G.H.L.

While evidence of one party's subjective intent has no independent place in this interpretative exercise, it has long been settled that whether the legal effect of a document is conditional on future agreements must be decided having regard, not only to the terms of the document, but to the &lsquo;genesis and aims of the transaction.&rsquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Hillas &amp; Co., Ltd. v.

<BLOCK2><TI>The contract issue: the legal framework</TI>
<P>76. The leading authority in Ontario (and indeed in Canada) on what constitutes a legally enforceable contract is the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bawitko Investments Ltd. v. Kernels Popcorn Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><YEAR>1991</YEAR><CITE>79 D.L.R. (4th) 97</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Bawitko</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>Bawitko</EM> establishes that there are three circumstances in which an agreement does not constitute an enforceable contract: (i) there is no enforceable contract where essential terms have not been agreed but instead have been left by the parties for future agreement; (ii) there is no enforceable contract where the provisions of what has been agreed are insufficiently certain; and (iii) there is no enforceable contract where the parties intend that a preliminary agreement is not to create binding contractual relations until a subsequent formal document is executed. As expressed by <EM>Bawitko</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>However, when the original contract is incomplete because essential provisions intended to govern the contractual relationship have not been settled or agreed upon; or the contract is too general or uncertain to be valid in itself and is dependent on the making of a formal contract; or the understanding or intention of the parties, even if there is no uncertainty as to the terms of their agreement, is that their legal obligations are to be deferred until a formal contract has been approved and executed, the original or preliminary agreement cannot constitute an enforceable contract. In other words, in such circumstances the &lsquo;contract to make a contract&rsquo; is not a contract at all. The execution of the contemplated formal document is not intended only as a solemn record or memorial of an already complete and binding contract but is essential to the formation of the contract itself.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>All three of these circumstances are present in this case.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Essential terms were not agreed but instead were left by the parties for future agreement</TI>
<P>77. As of the conclusion of the July 3, 2008 meeting, a large number of matters remained to be determined, including commission rates, operational issues, confidentiality terms, SLAs, and termination provisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See paragraphs 18-19 <EM>supra</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> These missing elements are not &ldquo;technical or administrative matters&rdquo; but rather are &ldquo;necessary components of the overall ... undertaking&rdquo;, resulting in the obligations being assumed by the parties being &ldquo;unclear and uncertain&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Consulate Ventures Inc. v.

Specifically, the alleged agreement at issue in that case lacked provisions for the nature of a land development, the respective responsibilities of the parties in respect of that development, and how encumbrances were to be dealt with.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. The absence of agreement on commission rates is, in itself, fatal. Price is invariably an essential element of a legally enforceable contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>L.C.D.H. Audio Visual Ltd. v. I.S.T.S. Verbatim Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1988</YEAR><CITE>40 B.L.R. 128</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont.

<P>79. Not only were commission rates not settled on July 3, 2008, there was confusion between the parties right up to January 2009 as to what the commission rates were,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See paragraphs 43-44.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and there was clearly never an agreement on the date on which the commission on new business would rise to 25%.</P>
<P>80. Like <EM>Bawitko</EM>, the missing elements as of July 3, 2008 go far beyond &ldquo;mere formalities or routine language&rdquo; in a complex arrangement that mandated &ldquo;express agreement on the detailed provisions set up to regulate the business relationship of the parties&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>In <BOLD><EM>my view, the terms of the franchise beyond those agreed to cannot be regarded as mere formalities or routine language</EM>.</BOLD> This is not a conventional document that requires only the filling in of blank spaces or the completion of minor details which the parties can impliedly be taken to have agreed upon. The terms of the draft clearly include material conditions essential to this kind of specialized contract. The very nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship mandates that there be <BOLD><EM>express agreement on the detailed provisions set up to regulate the business relationship of the parties</EM>.</BOLD> Here, taking the respondent's evidence at its highest, there was no meeting of the minds necessary for a completed contract. Certain terms, as the trial judge found, were agreed to on April 18, but others essential to the proposed contractual arrangement, with respect to which he made no findings, remained open for negotiation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bawitko</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> footnote 74 at para. 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>81. The situation was no different after the September 11, 2008 contract meeting. No doubt the parties were somewhat closer to agreement, but significant elements&mdash;including compensation and termination provisions&mdash;remained uncertain and to be agreed.</P>
<P>82. Indeed, the mere fact that material contract terms were the subject of negotiations at the contract meeting on September 11, 2008 contradicts the suggestion that a legally enforceable contract was formed at the meeting on July 3, 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <CASEREF><SOC>Nova Growth Corp. v. Kepinski</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 2763</CITE><PARANUM>150</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>83. Like <EM>Bawitko</EM>, the December 1, 2008 &ldquo;solid first draft&rdquo; contract was not a conventional document requiring the filling in of blank spaces or the completion of minor details. Certain terms had been agreed, but others that were essential remained open for negotiation.</P>
<P>84. In <CASEREF><SOC>United Gulf Developments Ltd. v. Iskandar</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supra, footnote 73.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a written document was found not to constitute a legally enforceable contract where it &ldquo;was not a simple agreement of purchase and sale&rdquo; but rather an agreement which &ldquo;mapped out how the parties would proceed on a cooperative basis with a substantial residential development.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The document failed to specify how six blocks of land would be serviced, how the six blocks would be allocated, and how road frontage for one of the blocks would be achieved. Similarly in this case, the alleged agreement relates to a substantial, long-term exclusive supply arrangement, with no agreement on a number of essential elements.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The provisions of what had been agreed were insufficiently certain</TI>
<P>85. For similar reasons, what the parties did manage to agree on at the July 3, 2008 meeting was not sufficiently certain to constitute a legally binding contract. Nor did the narrowing of issues at the September 11, 2008 contract meeting achieve sufficient certainty.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The parties did not intend to create binding contractual relations until a subsequent formal document was signed</TI>
<P>86. The entire structure of the transaction, starting from the &ldquo;Building the Vancity Insurance Customer Proposition&rdquo; document in March 2008 right through to the September 8, 2008 Contract Negotiations Document contemplated that there would be a non-binding letter of intent followed by a period of negotiation followed then, and only then, by a legally enforceable contract. At the relevant time, there is no evidence that anyone thought that a legally binding arrangement would be put in place prior to execution of a formal agreement&mdash;which never happened. The December 1, 2008 covering letter that accompanied the &ldquo;solid first draft&rdquo; of the contract shows no sign that CNS and RSA (the creators of the covering letter) thought that a legally enforceable contract was already in place.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>December 1, 2008 letter from Tony Hayes (CNS and RSA) to Terry Taciuk (Vancity Insurance); Motion Record of Vancity, Tab 2L, p. 204.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, the covering letter, viewed objectively, is part of a continuing negotiation process that would not culminate until a formal document was signed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>There is no evidence of a conspiracy</TI>
<P>87. The conspiracy allegations are patently without merit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>88. There is no doubt that in the summer and fall of 2008, CNS and RSA were excited about the prospect of becoming Vancity Insurance's exclusive supplier, and plunged headlong into a significant amount of work to achieve that goal. But they got ahead of themselves, and close scrutiny of the parties' interactions reveals that they never managed to agree on all essential terms, or with sufficient certainty, and that they never got to the stage of a final written agreement which was always intended to be the point at which legally enforceable relations would arise. Disappointed with the way things turned out, CNS and RSA now look at the past with revisionist lenses, and subjectively see a comprehensive agreement which never actually arose at the relevant time.</P>
<P>89. No legally enforceable contract ever arose. There was no conspiracy. None of the allegations raise a genuine issue requiring a trial. This long-outstanding action (commenced in 2010) is amenable to summary judgment, and ought to be dismissed on that basis.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P>90. Vancity and Vancity Insurance therefore request an order dismissing this action with costs.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Co-operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-operators&rdquo;) is a holding company with subsidiaries which carry on business in the financial services sector, including insurance. It was the successful bidder in an auction by Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (&ldquo;VCU&rdquo;) of its shares in its wholly owned subsidiary, VanCity Insurance Services Ltd. (&ldquo;VISL&rdquo;), an insurance brokerage. The Plaintiffs (&ldquo;RSA/CNS&rdquo;) were unsuccessful bidders in that auction process.</P>
<P>2. There is no dispute that the auction process was fair and that Co-operators was at arm's length from VCU. As a result of its successful bid, Co-operators entered a Share Purchase Agreement dated July 21, 2009 with VCU (&ldquo;the SPA&rdquo;). 7081332 Canada Ltd. (&ldquo;708 Canada&rdquo;) is a subsidiary of Co-operators which was incorporated to purchase the shares of VISL.</P>
<P>3. Federated Agencies Limited (&ldquo;Federated&rdquo;) is also a subsidiary of Co-operators which carries on business as an insurance broker. However, Federated is not a party to the Share Purchase Agreement and the basis on which it was joined as a Defendant is unclear. Cooperators, Federated and 708 Canada are referred to by the plaintiffs in their Amended Statement of Claim, without differentiation, as Co-operators. In this Factum, they are referred to collectively as &ldquo;the Co-operators Group&rdquo;.</P>
<P>4. It is common ground that the Co-operators Group had no involvement whatsoever in the negotiations and meetings which are alleged to have taken place between VISL and RSA/CNS in 2008-2009 regarding the proposal for an exclusive underwriting relationship between them. When Co-operators was invited to bid on the shares of VISL in February 2009, it had no knowledge of the dealings between those parties. It is admitted by RSA/CNS that there was no relevant contact between RSA/CNS and Co-operators, Federated or 708 Canada at any time prior to Co-operators entering the SPA.</P>
<P>5. As detailed below, when Co-operators became aware of the negotiations between RSA/CNS and VISL during the course of its due diligence, it was advised by the management of VCU that there was no binding agreement with RSA/CNS with regard to the program which had been under negotiation. Co-operators necessarily relied on the representations of VCU in that regard.</P>
<P>6. The causes of action against the Co-operators Group are set out, somewhat opaquely, in paragraphs 18 and 20 of the Amended Statement of Claim. Paragraph 18 appears to allege that Federated, 708 Canada and Co-operators ordered YISL to use Co-operators as the carrier of its insurance program in place of the plaintiffs and thereby induced VISL to breach the alleged agreement it had with RSA/CNS. Quite apart from the fact that none of Co-operators, Federated and 708 Canada is an insurance company and, therefore, could not have acted as the carrier of the insurance program, there is absolutely no evidence of any such order having been given to VISL. The uncontradicted evidence is to the contrary.</P>
<P>7. Similarly, there is no evidence that the Co-operators Group had any knowledge that there was a binding agreement between the plaintiffs and VISL, or that any of the Co-operators Group intended to cause VISL to breach any agreement. Indeed, to the extent that there was a binding exclusivity agreement between RSA/CNS and VISL, as alleged by the plaintiffs, that agreement was effectively breached when VCU decided to sell VISL and invited Co-operators, RSA/CNS and other insurance companies to bid on the purchase of its VISL shares. As the successful bidder responding to VCU's invitation to bid, Co-operators cannot be said to have induced VISL to breach any agreement it might have had with RSA/CNS. In short, the evidence is wholly inadequate to support a cause of action for the tort of inducing breach of contract.</P>
<P>8. The plaintiffs plead in the alternative that in the Spring of 2009, Co-operators, 708 Canada and Federated joined an existing conspiracy between VISL and VCU with the object of convincing the plaintiffs of the &ldquo;illusion that it would be business as usual&rdquo; so that VISL's customer base could be maintained until the closing of the sale of VISL. There is simply no evidence of any such conspiracy.</P>
<P>9. Obviously, if VCU's position that there is no binding agreement with RSA/CNS is accepted, there would not be any basis for a claim against the Co-operators Group for the tort of inducing breach of contract. Similarly, as the only unlawful conduct identified by the plaintiffs as the basis for their conspiracy claim is the alleged inducement of a breach of contract, the dismissal of the claim for inducement would also be fatal to the conspiracy claim.</P>
<P>10. As detailed below, the plaintiffs' claims against the Co-operators Group simply have no basis in fact or law.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>THE INVOLVEMENT OF CO-OPERATORS</TI>
<P>11. The first involvement by Co-operators in the events giving rise to this litigation was the receipt of a general enquiry from Deloitte LLP (&ldquo;Deloitte&rdquo;) in February 2009, asking whether Co-operators might be interested in acquiring an unnamed insurance brokerage. Co-operators expressed interest in the opportunity and, at the request of Deloitte, executed a confidentiality agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of John Asher (&ldquo;Asher Affidavit&rdquo;), para. 8, Motion Record pg. 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. After the confidentiality agreement was executed, Deloitte identified the target as VISL and, in late February 2009, Co-operators received a presentation deck outlining VISL's business, in support of the proposed purchase opportunity. On March 9, 2009, Co-operators delivered a non-binding expression of interest to VCU to acquire the shares of VISL. Between March and July 2009, Co-operators engaged in a due diligence process with VCU regarding the proposed purchase.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. 9, Motion Record, pg. 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. RSA/CNS had also been invited to pursue the purchase of VCU's shares of VISL and had participated in the very same process as Co-operators, but had been unwilling to offer a price that was competitive with that offered by Co-operators. By February 2009, the Plaintiffs were aware that VCU had retained Deloitte to assist it in actively seeking a buyer for VISL.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. 10, Motion Record, pg. 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Co-operators performed due diligence on VISL and learned, through the due diligence process, that VISL had broker agreements with various insurance companies for which it issued insurance policies, including non-exclusive broker agreements between CNS and VISL dated October 17, 1998 and between RSA and VISL, dated August 1, 2004. VISL represented to Co-operators that those broker agreements with RSA and CNS were the only current agreements with the Plaintiffs.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. Hand Exhibit D, Motion Record, pg. 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. In a meeting between senior management at VCU and Co-operators on April 2, 2009, VCU advised that VISL had &ldquo;developed a branded program with CNS with a strategy to roll over all business from their other markets to this program....&rdquo; Co-operators was also expressly advised by VCU management that VISL did not have a current contract with CNS setting out the terms of that proposed new program.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. 12, Motion Record, pg. 9 and Tab E, p. 106</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. During its due diligence investigation, Co-operators was provided with a copy of an unexecuted document entitled &ldquo;Insurance Program Agreement&rdquo; between CNS and VISL, which was unsigned and labelled &ldquo;Draft for Discussion Purposes&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. 13, Motion Record pgs. 9-10 and Tab F.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Co-operators was repeatedly assured by VCU that the draft Insurance Program Agreement had never been finalized, remained in a state of negotiation and was not binding on VISL. While relying on the representations of VCU and VISL that there was no binding agreement with RSA or CNS regarding the matters addressed in the draft Insurance Program Agreement, Co-operators prudently sought and obtained an indemnity from VCU against any claim to the contrary by RSA or CNS. Co-operators never encouraged or induced VISL to breach or abrogate any agreement between it and CNS or RSA.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, paras. 14 and 15, Motion Record, pg. 10.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>THE SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT</TI>
<P>18. 708 Canada purchased the shares of VISL pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated July 21, 2009. The shares were not purchased from VCU directly, but rather, were purchased from Citizens Bank of Canada, which acquired them from VCU prior to the close of the transaction.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, paras. 16 and 17, Motion Record, pg. 10 and Tab G.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. At Section 5.3 of the Share Purchase Agreement, the vendors, YCU and Citizens Bank of Canada, represented that VISL was not bound by any material contract other than as disclosed in Schedule 5.3(12) of the Share Purchase Agreement. In that Schedule, VCU represented that the terms of VISL's relationship with CNS &ldquo;were never settled&rdquo;, but disclosed that CNS was asserting that there was a binding 5 year exclusivity commitment with a 2 year termination provision.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, para. 18, Motion Record, pg. 10 and Tab G, pg. 244.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. While relying on VCU's assurance that it did not have a binding agreement with RSA/CNS, in light of the Plaintiffs' allegations to the contrary, Co-operators negotiated with VCU and obtained a full indemnity, reflected in Section 8.2(2) of the Share Purchase Agreement against the possibility of a claim being made by CNS or RSA in relation to the alleged contract.</P>
<P>21. Section 5.1(8)(a)(i) of the SPA contains a representation and warranty of VCU that &ldquo;the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and the completion of the Transactions will not (whether after the passage of time or notice or both) result in the breach or violation of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under or conflict with ...any of its obligations under any Contract to which it is a party or by which any of its undertakings, property or assets is bound or affected.&rdquo; Section 1.1(33) of the SPA defines &ldquo;Contract&rdquo; as &ldquo;any agreement, contract, indenture, lease, deed of trust, licence, option, undertaking, promise or any other commitment or obligation, whether oral or written, express or implied, other than a Permit, and whether or not legally binding.&rdquo; Section 5.1 further acknowledges that the purchaser was relying on that representation and warranty. In the face of Section 5.1 it cannot be said that the Co-operators Group had any reason to believe that purchasing VISL would result in a breach of any agreement between VISL and RSA/CNS.</P>
<P>22. In entering the SPA, Co-operators' sole intention was to further its own economic interests by expanding its insurance brokerage business in British Columbia. Co-operators had no intention of interfering with or harming the interest of the Plaintiffs.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, paras. 19 and 20, Motion Record, pg. 11, Tab G, pg. 229.and Tab K p.270-1, Q.767&ndash;769</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>PLAINTIFFS' EVIDENCE IN RESPONSE TO THIS MOTION</TI>
<P>23. The affidavit of Glen Pentland sworn June 17, 2015 on behalf of the Plaintiffs provides no support whatsoever to the bald allegations that members of the Co-operators Group participated in a conspiracy or committed the tort of inducing a breach of contract. Indeed, Mr. Pentland admits that he had no knowledge of the proposed sale of VISL to Co-operators until approximately 12 hours before it was announced.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Glen Pentland (&ldquo;Pentland Affidavit&rdquo;), para. 54, Responding Motion Record, Vol. 4 Tab B, pg. 20.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. The affidavit of Keith Mottram, similarly offers no evidence in support of the allegations against the Co-operators Group.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Keith Mottram (&ldquo;Mottram Affidavit&rdquo;) sworn June 18, 2015, Responding Motion Record, Vol. 4, Tab C.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. The Plaintiffs also filed the Affidavit of Steven Anthony Hayes (&ldquo;Hayes&rdquo;) of RSA/CNS. In paragraph 8 of that Affidavit, Hayes makes the bald assertion that &ldquo;shortly after their purchase of VISL closed, Co-op induced VISL to breach the Agreement by cancelling it without providing the required 2 years notice of the cancellation.&rdquo; He offers no evidence in support of that bald assertion. The evidence is in fact to the contrary. The only agreements which Co-operators terminated, were the non-exclusive written broker agreements attached as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the affidavit of John Asher filed in support of this motion. Those broker agreements were terminated in accordance with their terms and there is no allegation of a breach of those agreements.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Hayes (&ldquo;Hayes Affidavit&rdquo;) sworn June 10, 2015, para. 8,</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Responding Motion Record, Vol. 1.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, Motion Record, Tab D.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Mottram Affidavit, Responding Motion Record, Vol. 4, Tabs C4 and C5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. In paragraph 90 of the Hayes Affidavit, Hayes asserts that VISL and VCU had decided in December 2008 that &ldquo;they were not going to proceed with settling the contract terms&rdquo; because of their decision to explore the market the sell VISL. That is an important admission as it would be impossible to find that the Co-operators Group induced VISL to not proceed to finalize the contract if, as alleged by Hayes on behalf of the Plaintiffs, VCU had already decided to go to market and to cause VISL not to proceed to settle that contract prior to any involvement of the Co-operators Group.
<P1><BOLD>Hayes Affidavit, Responding Motion Record, Vol. 1, para. 90, Tab A, pg. 37.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Hayes further admits that RSA/CNS was aware of VCU's intention to sell VISL and participated in the same auction process as Co-operators by appointing a friendly broker, Hub, to bid, in the hope that VISL would be purchased by Hub, which would pursue and maintain the program which RSA/CNS had been negotiating with VISL. RSA/CNS's efforts to move forward with the proposed program during the first half of 2009 were made in the hope that Hub would be the successful bidder, but obviously with knowledge that a different outcome was possible.
<P1><BOLD>Hayes Affidavit, Responding Motion Record, Vol. 1, paras. 99 to 115.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. A large number of undertakings were given on the examination for discovery of Hayes on March 25, 2014. Those undertakings included a request for particulars of the evidence relied upon to support the allegation that the Co-operators Group induced a breach of agreement and that the Co-operators Group knew of any such agreement. A similar undertaking was given to specify what was relied upon by the Plaintiffs to support the allegation that the Co-operators Group joined in a conspiracy, assisted VCU or VISL in maintaining an illusion of normal business and/or misrepresenting their true intentions as alleged in paragraph 20 of the Amended Statement of Claim.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, Motion Record, Exhibit L, Tab L, pg. 284.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. At the time this motion was brought, no answers had been received to the undertakings notwithstanding several requests for same. Although the Plaintiffs eventually answered the undertakings, the answers to the questions noted above were not entirely responsive and, in any event, amounted to no more than an assertion that the Co-operators Group was aware of the draft Agreement and of the dispute between RSA/CNS and VISL as to whether they had a binding agreement for the new program and, therefore, appreciated that there was a risk associated with the uncertainty surrounding the legal status of the negotiations between those parties.
<P1><BOLD>Asher Affidavit, Motion Record, Tab L, pg. 284 and answers to undertakings on the examination for discovery of Hayes.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES</TI>
<P>30. Is there any basis for the allegation that the Co-operators Group induced VISL to breach an agreement with the Plaintiff?</P>
<P>31. Is there any basis for the allegation that the Co-operators Group participated in an actionable conspiracy?</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;THE LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Test for Summary Judgment</TI>
<P>32. The Co-operators Group submits that the test forsummary judgment has been firmly established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak vs. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, and that the issues raised on this motion are amenable to summary judgment under that test.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak vs. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC7</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Inducing Breach of Contract</TI>
<P>33. The Co-operators Group did not participate in the negotiations between VISL and RSA/CNS and is not in a position to determine whether they entered a binding agreement. As indicated above, Co-operators Group relied on the representations of VCU that there was no binding agreement. Co-operators Group defers to the submissions made on behalf of VCU and 2421593 Canada Inc. in their motion for summary judgment on that issue.</P>
<P>34. It is well established that the elements of the tortof inducing breach of contract are:
<P1>(a) The defendant had knowledge of the contract between the plaintiff and the third party;</P1>
<P1>(b) The defendant's conduct was intended to cause the third party to breach the contract;</P1>
<P1>(c) T he defendant's conduct caused the third party to breach the contract; and</P1>
<P1>(d) T he plaintiff suffered damage as a result of the breach.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Correia vs. Canac Kitchens</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>91 OR 3rd 353</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD><EM>at para. 99</EM>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. On the evidence, it is clear that the Co-operators Group did not have knowledge of the alleged agreement between the Plaintiffs and VISL. The Co-operators Group was assured throughout by VCU that there was no binding contract. The Co-operators Group was not in a position to assess the merits of the representations being made to it in that regard and was entitled to rely on the assurances it received from VCU. Further, it is clear that nothing done by the Co-operators Group in responding to the request for bids or in entering the SPA was in any way intended to cause VISL to breach the alleged agreement. Further, on the Plaintiffs' own admission in the Hayes Affidavit, the conduct of the Co-operators Group did not cause VISL to breach the alleged agreement. To the contrary, that agreement, if it existed, was breached when VCU chose to go to market to sell its shares of VISL.</P>
<P>36. The case at bar has some parallels with the decision of the Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Harry Winton Investments Ltd. vs. CIBC Development Corp.</SOC></CASEREF> In that case, the plaintiff landlord decided to rent space to an abortion clinic. The defendant, Padulo, had been the major tenant in the building and objected to the landlord's decision and took the position that it constituted a breach of its lease entitling it to terminate the lease. The landlord disputed the tenant's position. The tenant commenced an action for a declaration that the lease was terminated and retained an agent to seek out new premises for it. The day after the action was commenced, the tenant met with the president of CIBC Development Corporation (&ldquo;Development&rdquo;) to discuss leasing new premises. A few months later, Padulo signed a new lease with Development. The former landlord sued Development for inducing breach of contract. On motion by Development, summary judgment was granted dismissing the action against it. The Court of Appeal stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The plaintiff's position appears to be that once Development became aware of the lease between the plaintiff and Padulo, Development was obliged to satisfy itself that Padulo had good grounds in law to establish a breach of the lease by the plaintiff before it, Development, could agree to rent to Padulo. As put by Mr. Morin (counsel for the plaintiff/appellant), once Development became aware of the contemporaneous settlement negotiations between plaintiff and Padulo, it was obliged to &ldquo;back off&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>The motions judge held that this was not a correct view. As he said (at para 9): &ldquo;It is not for Development to adjudicate the legitimacy of the claim of breach. To suggest otherwise would make the negotiating of commercial leases virtually impossible.&rdquo;....In our view, because Development approached Padulo and offered to lease space to it at a time that Padulo had already decided to breach its contract with the appellant, there can be no liability. The possibility of liability could only arise if Padulo had not yet decided to terminate its lease and had been approached by Development to consider new premises....</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>A similar point was made by Mandel J. in</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Zander vs. Canac Kitchens Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1988] O.J.

<P>37. As in the <EM>Harry Winton Investments</EM> case, there was no obligation on the Co-operators Group to determine which of RSA/CNS and VISL was correct. The evidence of the Plaintiffs is that VCU had decided to sell its interest and to not proceed to finalize the proposed agreement with RSA/CNS prior to any involvement by the Co-operators Group. In the circumstances, there can be no liability for inducing a breach of contract.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The Law of Conspiracy</TI>
<P>38. There is simply no evidence to support the alleged agreement between the Defendants. Further, there is no basis for a finding of conspiracy as a matter of law.</P>
<P>39. It is well established that the elements of the tort of conspiracy are as follows:<QUOTE><P><BOLD>The constituent elements of the tort of conspiracy are: (1) two or more defendants make an agreement to injure the plaintiff; (2) the defendants (a) use some means (lawful or unlawful) for the predominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff, or (b) use unlawful means with knowledge that their acts were aimed at the plaintiff and knowing or constructively knowing that their acts would result in injury to the plaintiff; (3) the defendants act in furtherance of their agreement to injure; and (4) the plaintiff suffers damages as a result of the defendants' conduct.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>

<P>40. In the case at bar the Plaintiffs do not suggest that there was an agreement to injure the Plaintiffs or that the defendants had the predominant purpose of injuring the Plaintiffs. To the contrary, they appear to allege that the defendants used unlawful means with knowledge that their acts were aimed at the Plaintiffs and that their acts would result in injury to the Plaintiffs. Quite apart from the fact that there is no evidence of any such agreement, the only allegedly</P>
<P>unlawful act which the Plaintiffs have identified as against the Co-operators Group is the inducing of a breach of contract. Accordingly, if there is no such inducement, there is no conspiracy.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The issue in this action reads like a first-year law school contracts examination question. It asks: Can there be a binding agreement when the parties intend there to be a binding agreement, announce to the insurance industry the fact of the agreement, agree on the essential terms of that agreement and jointly perform that agreement for over 12 months.</P>
<P>2. From July 2008 to May 2009 VCI performed the Program Agreement (defined herein). It was only after VCU entered into the agreement to sell VCI to the Co-operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-op&rdquo;) that VCI, for the first time, attempted to resile from the Program Agreement, having determined, as a result of the sale, it was not in its economic interest to be bound by the Program Agreement. Although VCU sold VCI, it agreed to indemnify VCI and Co-op if the Program Agreement was binding on VCI. VCU and VCI are now, as a result, cynically trying to avoid liability for the Program Agreement.</P>
<P>3. VCU and VCI would have this Court accept that VCI took a substantial commercial risk without an agreement in place, and would have this court ignore the actual facts, given by actual participants as to the formation, terms and implementation of that agreement and the subsequent actions of VCI in avoiding the finalization of the written agreement. The evidence of the participants in this process for both RSA/CNS and VCI, is further supported by the contemporaneous documents.</P>
<P>4. VCU and VCI's position that there is no agreement must be seen in the light of VCU's decision in December 2008 to sell VCI, its subsequent steps to delay responding to the Draft Insurance Program Agreement (defined herein), and its desire to avoid the financial consequences resulting from the sale of VCI to Co-op.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY</TI>
<P>5. Prior to July 2008, RSA/CNS had been a non-exclusive supplier of home or &ldquo;habitational&rdquo; insurance products to Vancity Insurance Services Ltd. (&ldquo;VCI&rdquo;, now renamed 2421593 Canada Ltd. &ldquo;242&rdquo;), an insurance broker and wholly owned subsidiary of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (&ldquo;VCU&rdquo;), pursuant to agreements that, among other things, provided a 20% commission rate for habitational insurance and a 90 day or 12 month notice for termination. RSA/CNS along with a number of other insurers including Sovereign General, Intact and Aviva, provided habitational insurance policies to VCI's approximately 20,000 customers.</P>
<P>6. In July of 2008, VCI announced to its employees and to the other insurers writing habitational policies for its customers, that after a selection process, RSA/CNS had been chosen to be its exclusive supplier of habitational insurance to its customers.</P>
<P>7. In two meetings in July and September 2008, VCI and RSA/CNS (sometimes jointly referred to as the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;) confirmed terms offered at prior meetings, and negotiated and agreed to enter into a new agreement, the essential terms of which were;
<P1>(a) RSA/CNS would be the exclusive habitational insurance provider for VCI's approximately 20,000 clients;</P1>
<P1>(b) the agreement would be for a 5 year term;</P1>
<P1>(c) the agreement was to be cancellable on 2 years notice;</P1>
<P1>(d) RSA/CNS would pay a 25% commission rate when the Program was fully implemented, rather than the standard 20%;</P1>
<P1>(e) RSA/CNS would pay an interim commission rate of 23% until the Program was fully implemented;</P1>
<P1>(f) RSA/CNS would pay a further one time commission of 5%on each policy as it rolled over from VCI's previous insurers;</P1>
<P1>(g) RSA/CNS and VCI would together design a custom insurance product that VCI would offer to its customers; and</P1>
<P1>(h) In the case that one of VCI's insurers, after being advised of the new exclusive relationship with RSA/CNS, prematurely canceled VCI's ability to write and renew business for that insurer, RSA/CNS would fill that void and offer an insurance product from RSA/CNS to those customers.</P1>
<P1>(collectively the &ldquo;<BOLD>Program Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;)</P1></P>
<P>8. From July 2008 to September 2009, although there was no written, signed agreement, RSA/CNS and VCI acted for all purposes as if their relationship was governed by the Program Agreement. RSA/CNS and VCI announced their new relationship to the world, jointly developed the first generation of the custom habitational insurance policy sold to VCI's customers, worked together to transfer or &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; approximately 9,000 insurance policies from VCI's other insurers, and made the decisions (for example underwriting and pricing decisions required for the rollover of each book of business from the different insurers) that were required in order to enable the rollover. In addition RSA/CNS paid for the rollover technology expenses and the project management costs agreed to in the Program Agreement. From July 2008 until July 2009 VCI and RSA/CNS worked together, harmoniously and without issue, to implement the Program Agreement.</P>
<P>9. However, in or about December of 2008, without the knowledge of RSA/CNS, VCU determined that it wished to sell VCI and thereafter embarked on what was initially a secret process that ultimately led to the sale of VCI to a direct competitor of RSA/CNS. RSA/CNS learned of the sale in May of 2009 although it was not advised of the identity of the purchaser until the public announcement of the sale in July, 2009 (&ldquo;the July Announcement&rdquo;) when VCU advised that VCI had been sold to Co-op. The sale to Co-op closed in September 2009. The work required to continue implementing the Program Agreement continued throughout the December 2008 to July 2009 period, as those VCI employees on the forefront of the implementation were not advised that VCU was trying to sell VCI.</P>
<P>10. Notwithstanding that it had operated as if there was an agreement for more than 12 months, following the advice to RSA/CNS of the sale of VCI in May, 2009, VCU took the position with RSA/CNS <EM>for the first time</EM> that as there was no signed agreement there was no binding agreement.</P>
<P>11. Following the closing of the sale of VCI to Co-op in September, 2009, Co-op through its subsidiary Federated, advised RSA/CNS that as of September 10, 2009, it would no longer be supplying habitational insurance products to VCI, and purported to terminate the relationship between RSA/CNS and VCI by terminating not the Program Agreement but prior non-exclusive insurer/broker agreements.</P>
<P>12. VCI and VCU are now taking the position that it was agreed by the Parties that there would be no binding agreement unless there was a written, signed agreement. However, there is no mention of such a pre-condition in any of the dealings between RSA/CNS and VCI during the RFI process and the contract meetings in July and September. VCI has provided no support for its assertion, and VCI's own actions from July 2008 to March 2009 belie that assertion. This is simply an attempt by VCI and VCU to avoid VCI's contractual responsibilities following the sale of VCI to Co-op.</P>
<P>13. VCI now takes the position that essential terms of the Agreement were not agreed to by the Parties.</P>
<P>14. In fact there is overwhelming evidence, not dependent on the credibility of any witness, that the Parties entered into the Program Agreement and worked for over 12 months to implement it. Throughout the period VCI had the benefit of an increased commission structure, an enhanced habitational policy to offer to its customers, and the other benefits of the exclusive relationship with RSA/CNS provided for in the Program Agreement. VCI and VCU only resiled from the Program Agreement once it decided that the Program Agreement was not in its best interest. VCU recognized that it was not in its economic interest and it could decrease the value of VCI, if VCI was subject to the Program Agreement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>THE WITNESSES</TI>
<P>15. VCI has not filed any affidavit evidence of any witness from VCI or VCU on this motion for summary judgment. The witness produced by VCI and VCU on discovery had essentially no knowledge of the negotiation of the Program Agreement, its terms, or its implementation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Examinations for Discovery of Rick Sielski, Q.'s 24, 36, 39-40, 88, 126&ndash;129, 203&ndash;226, 238, 312, 315-316, 394&ndash;477.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. RSA/CNS has filed affidavits from 3 witnesses each of whom had personal involvement in either the negotiation of the Program Agreement or its implementation.</P>
<P>17. Tony Hayes (&ldquo;Hayes&rdquo;) was one of the two most senior people involved for RSA/CNS during the RFI process, and the negotiation of the Program Agreement. He left his employment with RSA in 2014 and is now the CEO of Vancouver Island Insurance Centres, a large insurance brokerage on Vancouver Island.</P>
<P>18. Glen Pentland (&ldquo;Pentland&rdquo;) was, at the relevant time, the Business Development Manager for VCI. He was intimately involved in the negotiation of the Program Agreement, and headed up the day to day implementation of the Program Agreement on behalf of VCI. He worked closely with Terry Taciuk the President of VCI (&ldquo;Taciuk&rdquo;). When VCI was sold to Co-op he was then employed by Federated Agencies (Co-op's BC agency and a defendant in this lawsuit), leaving in April 2012. He is now employed as Marketing Manager with British Columbia Automobile Association.</P>
<P>19. Keith Mottram (&ldquo;Mottram&rdquo;) worked at RSA for 36 years, retiring in July 2013. He had responsibility for managing the transfer or &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; of insurance business under the Program Agreement, from VCI's other insurers to RSA/CNS.</P>
<P>20. In paragraphs 46 and 47 of the VCI Factum counsel makes serious allegations of impropriety in the preparation of the affidavit material relied upon by RSA/CNS. He alleges that the material was &ldquo;carefully crafted&rdquo; by RSA/CNS's counsel over the &ldquo;full year taken to come up with the affidavits&rdquo;. Counsel is fully aware that a significant part of the delay occurred as a result of the untimely death of Theodor Kerzner, requiring among other things, the retainer of other co-counsel to assist in this matter.</P>
<P>21. In addition, the actions of the Parties and the documentary evidence is consistent with and supports the evidence of Hayes, Pentland and Mottram. There is no evidence offered by VCI or VCU to support their position that no agreement was reached.</P>
<P>22. The one important witness that this Court has not heard from is Taciuk. He was the driving force at VCI, behind the move to a single source insurer that culminated in the Program Agreement. In addition as is clear from the documents, he was actively misleading RSA/CNS about the status of the Draft Insurance Program Agreement.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>23. Since at least 1998 there had been an ongoing non-exclusive, insurer-broker relationship between CNS as insurer and VCI as broker. This agreement provided, among other things, a commission rate of 20%, was non-exclusive, and contained a 12 month notice of termination by the broker.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supplementary Motion Record (&ldquo;SMR&rdquo;), Tab 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the &ldquo;1998 Agreement&rdquo;) It did not provide for a signing bonus, a rollover bonus or a CNS deposit, or a 5 year term.</P>
<P>24. Since at least 2004 there had been an ongoing non-exclusive, insurer-broker relationship between RSA as insurer and VCI as broker. This agreement provided, among other things, a commission rate of 20%, was non-exclusive, and contained a 90 day notice of termination by the broker.
<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supplementary Motion Record, Tab 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the &ldquo;2004 Agreement&rdquo; and collectively with the 1998 Agreement the &ldquo;Old Agreements&rdquo;) It did not provide for a signing bonus, a rollover bonus or a CNS deposit, or a 5 year term.</P>
<P>25. CNS was purchased by RSA in January 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSA/CNS Responding Motion Record (&ldquo;RMR&rdquo;), Volume 1, Tab A, Affidavit of Stephen Anthony Hayes (&ldquo;Hayes Affidavit&rdquo;), Para. 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. In February 2008, RSA/CNS received a &ldquo;Request for Interest&rdquo; from VCI for the provision of &ldquo;new, innovative insurance products&rdquo; (&ldquo;the &ldquo;RFI&rdquo;). The RFI was issued following approval given to VCI by VCU's Executive Team to pursue a single insurer partnership, an idea promoted by Taciuk. In the RFI, VCI stated it was pursuing a &ldquo;unique and bold strategy&rdquo; to enter into an exclusive relationship with one insurer rather then the industry standard broker/insurer model where a broker works with multiple insurers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Hayes Affidavit, Volume 1, Tab A, Para. 13, 14, 18, Ex. 1; RMR, Volume 4, Tab B <UNDER>Affidavit of Glen Pentland</UNDER>, (&ldquo;Pentland Affidavit&rdquo;) Para. 11, 12, 17 and 18, Ex. A.; Examination for Discovery of Rick Sielski, Q.'s 21&ndash;25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. RSA/CNS responded to the RFI and among other terms proposed a &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; with a 5-year commitment and an increase in the standard commission rate from 20% to 25%. Upon receipt of RSA/CNS's response, VCI requested further information from RSA/CNS in a &ldquo;Request for Proof of Concept&rdquo;. RSA/CNS responded with a &ldquo;Proof of Concept&rdquo; outlining in more detail its proposal for a 5 year &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; with increased commission from 20% to 25%, profit sharing, a 5% bonus paid on policy transfer and a minimum of a 6 month cancellation period. RSA/CNS and VCI met on June 10, 2008 to discuss the Proof of Concept (the &ldquo;Proof of Concept Meeting&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 15, 16, 17, 18, Ex. 2, 3, 4, 5; Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 13, 14, Ex. B, C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. Before choosing RSA/CNS, VCI needed to be comfortable that RSA/CNS were committed to the unique arrangement. Throughout the RFI process VCI highlighted the vulnerability and risk assumed by VCI by entering into a single insurer relationship. Consolidating a broker's portfolio to a single insurer is uncommon in the industry because of the risk of a broker relying on one insurer for underwriting and pricing competitiveness across a wide spread of risks. Insurers from time to time stop writing certain classes of business, increase prices as markets harden and vary the level of service they provide to brokers depending on their internal efficiency initiatives. Because brokers are dependent on insurers to underwrite their portfolio of risks, brokers generally avoid single insurer relationships to protect against the risks listed above, and the fear of insurers marketing directly to consumers, which can negatively impact the growth and profitability of their brokerage. As a result of this concern, VCI wanted RSA/CNS to agree to a long termination period if it wanted to cancel the new relationship because of the risks it faced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, paras 17&ndash;21;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. During the Proof of Concept Meeting, according to Pentland, VCI expressed the desire for a five year term, a two-year rehabilitation period (if any problems occurred in the relationship or there was a deteriorating loss ratio) and a 12 month notice of termination period starting after the two-year rehabilitation period. VCI felt that these terms would protect it from some of the risk associated with a single insurer arrangement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 13, 14, Ex. B, C; Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 15, 16, 17, 18, Ex. 2, 3, 4, 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> RSA/CNS's notes following this meeting record that VCI asked for a notice of termination of 12 months.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 21; Hayes Affidavit, Para. 18, 19., Ex 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. Following the Proof of Concept Meeting, VCI asked for and was given approval by VCU's leadership to proceed with the RSA/CNS partnership. In late June, 2008 VCI telephoned RSA/CNS to advise that RSA/CNS had been selected to enter into negotiations to be their exclusive habitational provider and the parties arranged to meet on July 3, 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 15, 23; Hayes Affidavit, Para. 21, Pentland cx, pages 4-5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>THE JULY 3, 2008 MEETING</TI>
<P>31. The meeting on July 3, 2008 (the &ldquo;July 3 Meeting&rdquo;) was attended by, among others, Keenan and Hayes for RSA/CNS and Taciak and Pentland for VCI. The evidence of the Parties and the minutes clearly show that the parties at the meeting set out agreements reached and the future steps to implement their new relationship.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit. Paras. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28; RMR Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 23, Ex. D, E.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. At the July 3 meeting, in order to respond to VCI's concerns, RSA/CNS confirmed that in addition to a 5 year term, it would agree to a 12 month termination provision rather then the 6 month period set out in the Proof of Concept.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 19, 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. In addition to the 5 year term and 12 month termination provision, VCI and RSA/CNS agreed at the July 3 Meeting, that:
<P1>(a) RSA/CNS would be VCI's exclusive supplier of habitational insurance;</P1>
<P1>(b) RSA/CNS and VCI would together design a custom habitational insurance product to be offered to VCI's customers which in July 2008, was anticipated to be available as of January 1, 2009;</P1>
<P1>(c) Commission was to increase in accordance with the proposal in the Proof of Concept-25% when the Program was in full effect;</P1>
<P1>(d) RSA/CNS would pay a bonus of 5% upon the rollover of each insurance policy;</P1>
<P1>(e) VCI would receive 25% profit sharing, an increase from the standard 10%;</P1>
<P1>(f) RSA/CNS would dedicate 1% of premium volume to marketing;</P1>
<P1>(g) RSA/CNS would pay the technology costs necessary for the rollover;</P1>
<P1>(h) Both VCI and RSA/CNS would hire project managers to manage the project;</P1>
<P1>(i) VCI and RSA/CNS agreed that the agreement of their &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; would be announced on July 8, 2008; and</P1>
<P1>(j) RSA/CNS would coordinate the rollover of VCI's existing business to RSA/CNS, in order to ensure VCI's business was protected if there was an insurer backlash/cancellation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31; Pentland Affidavit, Para. 26, Ex. E., CX Hayes pages 23-24</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>34. The evidence of the terms of the agreement reached at the July 3 Meeting comes from Hayes and Pentland. The Minutes of the July 3 meeting were prepared by Pentland. They both offer consistent evidence as to what was agreed. There is simply no evidence that the terms agreed to were other then what is set out in paragraph 32 above. The only difference in their evidence is that Mr. Pentland believes that the VCI's request for a 2+ year termination notice began at the Proof of Concept Meeting and continued at the July 3 Meeting, whereas the RSA/CNS document marked as Exhibit &ldquo;6&rdquo; to Hayes affidavit shows that VCI wanted a rehabilitation term and to extend the termination notice period to 12 months from the 6 months offered by RSA/CNS at that time. In fact Hayes' evidence was that at the July 3 Meeting the 12 month termination notice requested by VCI, was confirmed by RSA/CNS. In the end because of the agreement reached at the September 11 Meeting this evidentiary difference is irrelevant.</P>
<P>35. Throughout the discussions in June and at the July 3 Meeting, VCI expressed a concern about the effect that the exclusive arrangement with RSA/CNS would have on the other insurers that, at that time, wrote habitational insurance for VCI's customers. VCI was concerned that those insurers, on being advised that VCI had entered into an exclusive relationship with RSA/CNS, would cancel their agreements with VCI and stop writing policies before the RSA/CNS custom product was available. In order to address this concern, VCI and RSA/CNS agreed at the July 3 Meeting that, if an insurer cancelled, the project timeline would be accelerated and RSA/CNS would provide their current insurance policy for VCI to offer to its customers pending the development of the custom product to be jointly developed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 28, 31, Ex. 11; Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 25, 26, Ex.

<P>36. In cross-examination Pentland had the following to say about the agreement that he says was reached at the July 3 Meeting:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>...in those conversations we had with CNS, there was commitments from us in terms of rolling the portfolio, a 5% commission, an additional 5% commission so that we would be up from 20 to 25 over a period of time, an additional 5 percent override, a five year term, and the piece that's not really articulated is the commitment piece because of the risk that we were taking on...that was a big part of our discussion in every step of the way. With each of the insurers that we deal with the discussion was we are going out on a limb in terms of risk, and so the need for that security in the process of doing that...within a couple of days [of the July 3 Meeting] we were talking to partners, and we were expressing that we had an agreement with CNS as our sole distributor...this wasn't something where an insurer, CNS, would cancel on us in 30 day&mdash;60 or 90 days...&rdquo; (GP CX pages 13 and 14)</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>For most of the remuneration in terms of commissions was fairly locked down. Override commission was locked down. Marketing support and that stuff was locked down.

<BLOCK3><TI>FOLLOWING JULY 3, 2008 MEETING</TI>
<P>37. Following the July 3 Meeting, Taciak and Pentland met with VCI's other insurers including Sovereign General and Intact, and told them that RSA/CNS had been chosen as the exclusive habitational insurance provider, to commence January 1, 2009, and that VCI would be cancelling its agreements with those insurers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 32; Pentland Affidavit, Paras, 27, 28;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. VCI would not have advised the other insurance companies if it did not believe it had a binding agreement with RSA/CNS on the essential terms of the Program Agreement, following the July 3 Meeting. VCI recognized that &ldquo;there was no going back&rdquo; once VCI had announced its &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; with RSA/CNS to its other insurers. Pentland, on cross-examination did not agree with VCI's current position that out of the July 3 Meeting there had to further discussion to &ldquo;move towards a definitive agreement that would be signed by both parties&rdquo;...and said:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>...I would say no. Because out of July 3 for us to go to our other insurers and say, we're going to cancel our agreement with you, we needed total certainty that we had a partner on board. It wasn't a case of the existing contract the existing arrangements...we need assurances. So we had Ken Keenan absolutely committing that yes, we were there for you. We're going to put this together. There's some details that we don't know about it, but there was a lot of stuff that we had talked about. We were pretty confident, yeah, that works, that works, that works, that works. But the piece around&mdash;you know, was it loose? Absolutely not. Because there is no way I could go to those insurers and say, I'm going to cancel my agreement with you.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 31, Cross Examination of Glen Pentland, p. 15, L. 8&ndash;24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>39. One of VCI's insurers, Sovereign General (&ldquo;SG&rdquo;), on being advised of the new agreement with RSA/CNS, gave VCI immediate notice that, as of July 10, 2008, VCI could no longer bind SG for new habitational insurance policies and, as of October 10, 2008, VCI could no longer renew SG policies. This immediate cancellation, although a foreseen risk, caused an acceleration of the implementation of the Program Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 37, 38; Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 29, 30, 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. In accordance with the Program Agreement, each of VCI and RSA/CNS announced the new relationship to their employees on July 8, 2008. In its written announcement to its employees, VCI described the risks associated with entering in to an exclusive arrangement with one insurer and expressed its belief that &ldquo;<BOLD>Both Vancity Insurance and [RSA/CNS] have tied our fates together and so working together is imperative</BOLD>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<BOLD>RSA/CNS had a much stronger recognition...that this endeavor would require a high degree of partnership and shared commitments</BOLD>.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 33, 34, Ex. 12, 13; Pentland Affidavit, Para. 32, 33, 34, Ex.

<P>41. On July 14, 2008 VCI formally announced to VCU that it had entered in to a &ldquo;meaningful, long term partnership with a large national insurer&rdquo; with RSA/CNS. There is no evidence whatsoever, that any VCI or VCU employee questioned that an announcement was made without there being a written, signed contract or that it was made without essential terms of that agreement not being reached.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 39, Ex. 17; Pentland Affidavit, Para. 35, Ex I.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. Between the announcements referred to above and September 11, 2008 the Parties had many meetings and made many decisions, in order to proceed with the now accelerated implementation of the Program Agreement, including meetings on July 15, 2008 entitled the &ldquo;Rollover Planning Session&rdquo; attended by Pentland and Mottram, July 24, 2008 entitled the Vancity Brovada Rollover Project called by Mottram, and a meeting on August 5, 2008 entitled Program Project Status Update attended by Mottram. These are just 3 of the meetings that demonstrate that the Parties were operating under the Program Agreement and implementating the Program Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 40&ndash;48, Ex. 18&ndash;27; RMR Volume 4, Tab B Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 36&ndash;46, Ex.

<BLOCK3><TI>THE SEPTEMBER 11 MEETING</TI>
<P>43. VCI and RSA/CNS met on September 11, 2008 (the &ldquo;September 11 Meeting&rdquo;) to further discuss their relationship.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 49; RMR Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Paras. 47&ndash;50, Ex. O.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. Notwithstanding that VCI and RSA/CNS had agreed to a 12 month termination provision at the July 3 Meeting, VCI wished to evidence a stronger commitment from RSA/CNS to the relationship and accordingly asked RSA/CNS at the September 11 Meeting to amend their previous agreement and to provide a two year rehabilitation period prior to the one year notice of termination. It was Hayes' undisputed evidence that after negotiation at the September 11 Meeting, the Parties agreed to extend the termination notice period to 2 years. In addition VCI and RSA/CNS agreed that the first year of the 2-year period would be a rehabilitation period where the parties would work together to solve the issues that caused notice to be given.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 53&ndash;55, 61, Volume 2, Ex. 30; RMR Volume 4, Tab B, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 49, Ex. O.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. Hayes acknowledged in his examination for discovery at Q 410 that prior to the September 11 meeting the Parties had not concluded an agreement on how the non-performance by 1 party would give the other party the right to terminate, contrary to was is stated in paragraph 33(i) of the Factum of VCU and VCI. This was the question asked and answered in the examination for discovery. There is no evidence that the Parties considered that this was an essential tem.</P>
<P>46. As the September 11 Meeting was in the context of SG's cancellation, VCI requested and RSA/CNS agreed to pay an &ldquo;interim&rdquo; commission on policies written until the full 25% commission came in to effect once the Program Agreement was fully implemented, which was anticipated at that time, to be January 1, 2009. RSA/CNS and VCI agreed that this interim commission would be 23%. There is no evidence that suggests that Hayes and Pentland are incorrect when they state that this was the agreement from the September 11 Meeting. VCI confirmed the that the 23% was agreed to at the September 11 Meeting in Pentland's email dated January 8, 2009 where he stated in his email to Tony Hayes &ldquo;...It was mine and Terry's understanding that the following was agreed to in the first discussion on the contract in early September...&rdquo;. Further evidence confirming that 23 % had been agreed to comes from the evidence of Co-op where they confirm that when they conducted their due diligence the commission rate they saw was 23%.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 56, 59, Volume 2, Ex. 42; RMR, Volume 4, Tab B, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 42, Ex. P., SMS, Tab 3A</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. In addition to the above VCI and RSA/CNS agreed at the September 11 Meeting:
<P1>(a) that the 5 year term would commence when the Program was fully implemented, which was still anticipated to be January 1, 2009;</P1>
<P1>(b) that RSA/CNS would pay an administrative allowance (draft agreement Sch &ldquo;E&rdquo; (d) to VCI of $135,000 and make a deposit of $5,000,000 with VCU, when the written agreement was signed;</P1>
<P1>(c) that RSA/CNS would make a one-time $50,000 payment towards Marketing Support (in addition to the 1% agreed to in the Proof of Concept); and</P1>
<P1>(d) RSA/CNS agreed to pay $56,000 towards the project manager for VCI.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 54, 55, 56, Volume 2, Ex 29, 30</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>48. The evidence as to the change in the termination provision and the additional terms of the agreement reached at the September Meeting came from Hayes, Pentland not having attended the meeting. Pentland did prepare the Contract Negotiations outline dated September 8, 2008. There is no evidence from VCI that the Parties did not agree to a 2 year termination provision or that the additional terms agreed to at the September 11 Meeting were other than is set out in paragraph 56 of Hayes' affidavit, which sets out, in addition, contract terms confirmed from the July 3 Meeting. In addition Hayes' note made after the September 11 Meeting confirms the agreement to extend the termination notice to 2 years with the 1<SUP>st</SUP> year to include rehabilitation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, para 61, Volume 2, Ex. 30</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. At the September 11 Meeting, VCI and RSA/CNS determined that as they had agreed on the essential terms of their agreement, RSA/CNS would prepare and circulate a first draft of a written contract to reflect those terms. There was no agreement to prepare a Letter of Intent or the Spirit and Intent non-binding agreement referred to in in Exhibit 28 to Hayes' affidavit prepared by VCI before the September 11 Meeting, or is there any evidence that VCI or RSA/CNS was expecting one following the agreement that RSA/CNS would prepare the first draft of the written contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 57, Volume 2, Exhibit 28; RMR Volume 4, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. At no time however was there any discussion or agreement that a signed, written contract was a pre condition to an agreement between the Parties. The Parties behaviour after the July 3 Meeting and the September 11 Meeting clearly shows that they were implementing the Program Agreement.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT</TI>
<P>51. From and after July 3, 2008 VCI and RSA/CNS acted in accordance with the Program Agreement.</P>
<P>52. They each made public and intra company announcements of the exclusive relationship as set out above.</P>

<P>57. RSA/CNS and VCI worked together to develop the computer programming required to roll over approximately 20,000 insurance policies from 5 or 6 different insurers to RSA/CNS.

<P>66. As had been agreed at the July 3 Meeting and the September 11 Meeting, the Draft Insurance Program Agreement provided that:
<P1>(a) CNS would be the exclusive supplier of habitational insurance products to VCI and VCU's customers (s. 9.01);</P1>

<P>67. RSA/CNS indicated to VCI in its letter dated December 1, 2008 that accompanied the Draft Insurance Program Agreement, that while the agreement reached at the September 11 Meeting contemplated the payment of the $135,000 &ldquo;signing bonus&rdquo; when the contract was signed, RSA/CNS was open to a discussion to pay it before December 31, 2008. The $135,000 was paid by RSA/CNS to VCI in December 2008.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<BLOCK3><TI>RESPONSE TO DRAFT CONTRACT</TI>
<P>69. On December 12, 2008, in response to an email from RSA/CNS to VCI with respect to Sch. E of the Draft Agreement, Pentland advised:
<QUOTE><P>...what a detailed contract it is. I think it is close and Terry will be talking to Ken.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 80, Ex. 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>70. In a January 19, 2009 email Taciuk advised Rick Sielski a member of the Executive Committee of VCU that:
<QUOTE><P>FYI we have received some industry advice on our CNS contract however I am holding off sending this to our external lawyers so that we don't waste money given project Jet.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 48.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>71. On January 27, 2009, Mittal (VCI's project manager) asked Pentland about the status of the contract. Pentland then asked Taciuk who replied &ldquo;We are still waiting for our lawyers but I have been promised soon.&rdquo; However there is no evidence that Taciuk ever sent the draft contract for legal review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. On February 10, 2009, Hayes sent Taciuk an email enquiring about the status of the contract. Taciuk immediately advised Sielski of the request and said:
<QUOTE><P>What I propose is that I tell Tony [Hayes] that we are close with the contract and that we will be getting back to them on &ldquo;x&rdquo; date that would be after you have pitched RSA. If that will be more then a week or two I will need a new plan.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>73. On February 11, 2009, Taciuk responded by e-mail to Hayes' follow up concerning the status of the contract review. This e-mail provides the only evidence that VCI disagreed with any of the terms of the Draft Insurance Program Agreement. He said:
<QUOTE><P>I guess we are even on having slow lawyers...There are a few areas where the contract appears to need more material changes for example it does contemplate Agency billing while our agreed plan is direct bill. We are also looking at providing frameworks for the appendices so that we can progress that as the next step.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>It is obvious from Taciuk's email where he highlights a small detail that he must have carefully read the Draft Insurance Program Agreement. It is very instructive that the only term he questions is this small detail.</P>
<P>74. In early March Pentland, again asked Taciuk about the status of the contract. Taciuk emailed Sielski on March 4, 2009 and said:
<QUOTE><P>I have also been hearing from the CNS President that he is getting heat because we don't yet have a contract.</P>
<P>I know where we are in our process. Any bright thoughts on how I can forestall? So far I am blaming this on our backed-up legal department and a corporate cost control edict not to use external legal counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>75. On March 16, Taciuk advised Seliski that:
<QUOTE><P>FYI CNS is still looking for the contract. I am continuing to use legal backlogs as the reason for delay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>76. On March 26, 2009, Taciuk advised Hayes that:
<QUOTE><P>Unfortunately the wheels of commerce are slow here at Vancity at the present time. I will provide you an update as soon as I receive one for [sic] our legal department.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>77. In none of this correspondence is there any indication of any disagreement with the essential terms of the Draft Insurance Program Agreement, as agreed in the July 3 Meeting and September 11 Meeting. Even with his desire to avoid finalizing in writing the Program Agreement, Taciuk did not suggest there was anything incorrect in the Draft Insurance Program Agreement with respect to the essential terms&mdash;he only referred to a change being required to show that the agreed plan was to direct bill the clients not agency bill, a very small part of the administrative services set out in the Draft Insurance Program Agreement to be provided by VCI under section 3.01.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Ex. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. In addition, these foregoing paragraphs make it clear that VCI had no intention of finalizing the Draft Insurance Program Agreement. Instead, it led RSA/CNS (and its own employees) to believe that memorialization of the Program Agreement was proceeding. With the exception of one comment from Taciuk, no feedback was received by RSA/CNS indicating that there were any concerns about the Draft Insurance Program Agreement. Now, in this motion VCI attempts to use that foot dragging to its benefit and RSA/CNS' detriment. The foot dragging was acknowledged by Taciuk to Pentland in his email of June 17, 2009 (after the sale to Co-op, but before the announcement and before Pentland has been told of the sale) where he states, when responding to an email from Pentland to Mottram asking Mottram to develop more formalized monthly financial reporting:
<QUOTE><P>I don't think it is fair to ask CNS to do this work until we do have the contract finalized, the delay is clearly our fault. Lai can make the appropriate estimates based on your inputs on commission levels. Once the contract is finalized we will need to do a full reconciliation with CNS...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR Volume 4, Tab B, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 55, Ex. P.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>79. On approximately May 25, 2009, RSA/CNS was advised by VCU that. VCI had been sold. RSA/CNS immediately wrote VCU and requested confirmation that, among other things, that the &ldquo;Insurance Program Agreement&rdquo; was for a 5 year term with a 2 year cancellation period &ldquo;as the parties agreed&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 109, Ex. 76.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>80. On May 28, 2009, Rob Malli, the V.P. Finance for VCU responded and advised that:
<QUOTE><P>Our view of the relationship between Vancity Insurance Services Ltd. (&ldquo;VISL&rdquo;) and Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company (&ldquo;CNS&rdquo;) is quite different then than the one you describe...As I am sure you are aware, the form of document for the insurance program that you sent us in early December was CNS' first draft. This draft contained a number of errors, was never signed and does not reflect VISL's understanding of the current business arrangement between VISL and CNS.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Para. 110, Ex. 77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>There is no evidence that Malli had any meaningful involvement in the Program or that he attended any meetings where the Agreement was discussed or the contractual terms agreed to. There is also no evidence that VCI disagreed with any of the essential terms of the Draft Insurance Program Agreement. If there was any genuine disagreement VCI would have raised those issues, rather than waiting until after VCU had signed the sale agreement with Co-op.</P>

<BLOCK3><TI>SALE OF VCI</TI>
<P>83. By December 2008, VCU had determined that it would explore selling VCI. This process, called &ldquo;Project Jet&rdquo; culminated in the sale of VCI to the defendant The Co-operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-Op&rdquo;) in September 2009.</P>
<P>84. Notwithstanding the decision to sell VCI, VCI and VCU were concerned about the effect that the agreement with RSA/CNS would have on the potential sale.</P>
<P>85. In an email date December 17, 2008 from Taciuk to Sielski and other Tacuik stated:

<P>86. In a Vancity document discussing JET the writer states:
<QUOTE><P>How does the implementation of Program [the agreement with RSA/CNS] affect this sale?</P>
<P>This presents a challenge. The more of our book that rolls to only one company the more challenging the sale. Our book is a big book and currently there is a good balance with 3 markets owning the bulk of the book...The contracts with Sovereign General has been cancelled and we are rolling all of this business to the Vancity Pure Home. The Ing contract has been terminated and January 5, 2009 we will begin rolling over policies with mid February effective dates.</P>

<P>87. In mid-March 2009, RSA/CNS was advised that VCU was exploring selling VCI. A broker, working with RSA/CNS, bid to purchase VCI but that bid was unsuccessful. Despite the potential sale, VCI continued, day to day while working on implementation of the Program Agreement, to act as if nothing had changed. We now know that Pentland knew nothing about the sale of VCI until 12 hours before the sale was announced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Hayes Affidavit, Paras. 99&ndash;109, Exs. 69&ndash;76; RMR, Volume 4, Tab B RMR, Volume 1, Tab A, Pentland Affidavit, Para. 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>ABSENCE OF ESSENTIAL TERMS</TI>
<P>88. In their factum VCU and VCI point to a number of terms that they allege were essential and were not finalized by the Parties as evidence that there was no binding agreement. However they provide no evidence that the terms they say were not finalized are essential. Pentland's evidence given at cross-examination when asked about a number of items that were outstanding including KPI's (although he said only contingency profit was outstanding), financial services; (his evidence was that the $5 million deposit was offered by RSA/CNS, and nothing further was expected by CNS); agreement on specific growth targets over the three-year period; specific strategies had not been agreed to to achieve targets, and strategies had not been developed for community leadership, Pentland responded:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>No. And nor would&mdash;nor would there been an expectation that you would have all of this agreed to at any particular time.

<P>Pentland's evidence recognizes that some of the detail of the implementation of the Program Agreement could not be decided so early in the process, and this was acceptable to the Parties.</P>
<P>89. The best evidence that there was an agreement between the Parties on the essential terms is the Draft Insurance Program Agreement and the fact that VCI made no material comment disputing any of the essential terms in the Draft Insurance Program Agreement prior to the sale of VCI to Co-op. In addition VCI cancelled the other insurance agreements and rolled over, over 9000 of its customers to RSA/CNS, its exclusive supplier of habitational insurance which would not have happened had there not been an agreement between the Parties on the essential terms governing their relationship.</P>
<P>90. It is improper for VCI/VCU to use its own failure to address the Draft Insurance Program Agreement to support its position that there was no binding agreement.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>91. This case presents two issues:
<P1>(a) is summary judgment an appropriate mechanism to determine the enforceability of the Program Agreement; and</P1>
<P1>(b) is there a valid agreement between RSA/CNS and VCI.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>92. RSA/CNS agree that the issue of whether or not the Program Agrement is enforceable does not require a trial and that it is an appropriate issue to be determined on a motion for summary judgment. The evidence available is sufficient for a fair and just determination of that issue.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hyrniak v Maudlin</SOC></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>AGREEMENT</TI>
<P>93. RSA/CNS takes the position that the oral agreement that was arrived at in July and September 2008, the terms of which are not in dispute, constitute a valid, enforceable contract. In other words the terms agreed to orally at the July 3 Meeting and the September 11 Meeting were the essential terms defining the legal relationship between VCI and RSA/CNS. The Ontario Court of Appeal had the following to say about such contracts:
<QUOTE><P>As a matter of normal business practice, parties planning to make a formal written document the expression of their agreement, necessarily discuss and negotiate the proposed terms of the agreement before they enter into it. They frequently agree upon the all of the terms to be incorporated into the the intended written document before it is prepared. Their agreement may be expressed orally or by way of memorandum, by exchange of correspondence, or other informal writings. The parties may &ldquo;contract to make a contract&rdquo;, that is to say, they may bind themselves to execute at a future date a formal written agreement containing specific terms and conditions. <BOLD>When they agree on all of the essential provisions to be incorporated in a formal document with the intention that their agreement shall thereupon become binding, they will have fulfilled all of the requisites for the formation of a contract.

<P>94.

<P>95. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ward v Ward</SOC></CASEREF> the Ontario Court of Appeal said:
<QUOTE><P>At common law, an agreement is binding if the parties consider that it contains all essential terms, even if the parties also agree that those terms will subsequently be recorded in a [page 413] more formal document together with the usual terms ancillary to that type of agreement.

<QUOTE><P>Parties may agree that they will execute a future, more formal document. If they have agreed on all of the essential terms and it is their intention that their agreement be binding, there is an enforceable contract; it is not unenforceable simply because it calls for the execution of a further formal document. The question is whether the further documentation is a condition of there being a bargain, or whether it is simply an indication of the manner in which the contract already made will be implemented. Professor Waddams, in <BOLD>The Law of Contracts,</BOLD> 5th ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2005) puts the question well:</P>
<P>&ldquo;Is execution of the formal contract a step in carrying out an already enforceable agreement, like a conveyance under an agreement to buy land, or is it a prerequisite of any enforceable agreement at all? ... [T]he test must be the reasonableness of the parties' expectations. Has the promisor committed himself to a firm agreement or does he retain an element of discretion whether or not to execute the formal agreement? In the former case there is an enforceable agreement. In the latter there is none.&rdquo; (section 51 page 36,)</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Co-Operators Group Limited (&ldquo;Co-Op&rdquo;), and its two wholly owned subsidiaries Federated Agencies Limited (&ldquo;Federated&rdquo;) and 7081332 Canada Ltd. (&ldquo;708&rdquo;) (collectively sometimes the &ldquo;Co-op Defendants&rdquo;) bring this motion for summary judgment to dismiss RSA/CNS's claims against them for inducing breach of contract and conspiracy.</P>
<P>2. Pursuant to a written agreement dated July 21, 2009 (the Co-op Agreement&rdquo;), Co-op, through 708, purchased the shares of VCI, owned by VCU.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supplementary Motion Record of RSA/CNS (&ldquo;SMR&rdquo;), Tab 4, Portion of Co-op Agreement</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. Following the purchase, Federated purported to terminate the 1998 Agreement and the 2004 Agreement (sometimes collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Old Agreements&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. The theme of the defence of the Co-op Defendants is that they did not know that VCI and RSA/CNS had entered in to the Program Agreement and therefore cannot be held liable for inducing breach of contract. This simply ignores the facts. On their own evidence it is clear that they did know, or were willfully blind, to the fact that since July 2008, VCI and RSA/CNS were operating under the Program Agreement, not the Old Agreements and in terminating the Old Agreements, they in fact, terminated the Program Agreement.</P>
<P>5. The Co-Op Defendants also assert the quite frankly ridiculous position that as VCU had already decided to breach the Program Agreement by selling the shares of VCI, nothing the Coop Defendants did caused the breach of the Program Agreement. That position simply ignores the fact that VCU sold the shares and therefore VCI remained liable for the Program Agreement it entered into until the Co-op Defendants terminated the relationship between RSA/CNS and VCI, by purporting to terminate the Old Agreements. Their actions are the direct cause of the termination of RSA/CNS's relationship with VCI.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>6. RSA/CNS rely on the facts set out in its factum in response to VCU and VCI's motion for summary judgment, including the defined terms set out therein.</P>
<P>7. RSA/CNS acknowledges that if this Court finds that if the Program Agreement is not binding it cannot succeed in its claim against the Co-op Defendants or any one of them, for inducing breach of contract. If however the Program Agreement was a valid agreement there is ample evidence to indicate that the Co-op Defendants knew that VCI and RSA/CNS were not operating under the Old Agreements but a new and different agreement with significantly different terms.</P>
<P>8. Early in its due diligence investigations the Co-op Defendants learned that since 2008, VCI had:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>...Established a strategy with CNS (Vancity Pure Home Program) with unique features (environmental coverages) and generous commission rates (23.5%initially and moving to 25%. CNS is also paying a 5% rollover commission and a $135K incremental commission upon contract signing (note: the actual contract is not in the data room).</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>Fraser [VCI] has put the other insurers on notice and is now rolling over business from Sovereign, Aviva, Ing, Axa and Wawanesa to CNS (started in November 2008 and will be staggered and complete in 2010).</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 3A</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. The terms set out above are significantly different from the Old Agreements, which were non exclusive, paid a commission rate of 20% and did not pay a roll-over commission or pay the $135,000 &ldquo;incremental commission&rdquo;.</P>
<P>10. By April 3, 2009 the Co-Op Defendants were reporting internally that:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>VISL developed a branded program with CNS with a strategy to roll over all business from their other markets to this program. The policy includes $10,000 of &ldquo;environmental cover&rdquo;...The commission terms and roll-over commission are very generous improving their revenue stream in the brokerage. They started in November and added 6 contract staff to manage the roll-over...</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>We asked management how they thought CNS would react if The Co-operators was the successful purchaser and the discussion didn't produce any conclusions. We also discovered that they do not have a current contract with CNS outlining the new terms which should be highlighted as a &ldquo;risk&rdquo; to this transaction.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 3B, p. 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>11. The Co-op defendants understood that prior to the &ldquo;branded program&rdquo; there were a number of different insurers providing home insurance to VCI's clients and that as a result of the &ldquo;branded program&rdquo;, and that all of the habitational business from their other markets was moving to RSA/CNS.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q. 163.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Co-op Defendants also concluded that there was a &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; of a negative reaction from RSA/CNS, if Co-op purchased VCI.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q. 188, SMR Tab 3D, Risk Assessment (Tab 8, Co-op Answers to Undertakings)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. By June 23, 2009, the Co-op Defendants had been provided by VCI with the Draft Insurance Program Agreement and the 2004 Agreement and been advised that:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>...Michele Buttles [a VCI employee] referred to the CNS &ldquo;draft&rdquo; contract and suggested CNS will hold them to the terms contained in this... and</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>...lawyers for Vancity are taking the position that it is the 2004 contract that is in force whereas lawyers for CNS are taking the position that the 2008 draft is in force...</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 3C pages 1 and 6, Asher CX Q's 202&ndash;204</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>13. Schedule 5.3 (12) to the Co-op Agreement provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>CNS is currently providing insurance services to the Corporation [VCI] on the basis of a relationship without a formal written contract. The terms of this relationship are not easily ascertained, but some of them may be included in a draft agreement provided by CNS to the Corporation in December 2008. The terms of the relationship were never settled. CNS is claiming that the arrangement may contain a 5 year term with a two year termination provision and exclusivity provisions. The Corporation and its legal counsel have received an email dated May 25, 2009 and a letter dated June 25, 2009 setting out CNS's position with respect to this arrangement.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 4, Portion of Co-op Agreement, page 10</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. All of the evidence that the Co-op Defendants had prior to entering into the Co-op Agreement indicated that RSA/CNS and VCI were operating under terms that were fundamentally different from the Old Agreements. In the end they simply &ldquo;did not care&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q &ellip10;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. The Co-op Defendants knew before they entered the agreement with VCU that although there was no signed agreement, RSA/CNS were taking the position that the Program Agreement was enforceable. The Co-op Defendants simply didn't care; all they were concerned about was whether there was a written, signed agreement or, at the end of the day an enforceable agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q's 88&ndash;90, 132, 231, 236</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. In fact Co-op admits that it did not have to form an opinion about which contract was enforceable because it had the indemnity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q 236, 257</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The Co-op Defendants knew before closing, that RSA/CNS was insisting on the terms of the Program Agreement including the two year termination provision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 3F</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The Co-op Defendants had a simple solution to the &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; that the terms of the Program Agreement were in force: obtain an indemnity from VCU, which they did as a part of the Co-op Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR, Tab 3D, Risk Assessment, Asher CX 257, 186&ndash;188, 226&ndash;228, 236</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Indemnity provides:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>In addition to any other indemnifications by Vancity contained in this Agreement and subject to this Article 8, Vancity shall indemnify and save harmless the Corporation [VCI], the Purchaser and the Co-operators Group limited from any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Corporation, the Purchaser or the Co-operators Group Limited as a result of or arising directly or indirectly our of or in connection with:</BOLD></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P><BOLD>(f) subject to the Co-operators complying with its obligations under Section 6.10, any Claim made against the Corporation, the Purchaser or Co-operators Group Limited arising out of the Insurer Agreements with CNS or Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company, directly or indirectly as a result of the Transaction;</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR Tab 4 page 3-4</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. The Co-op Defendants acknowledge that because of the indemnity they simply did not care and it was irrelevant to them whether the Program Agreement was binding.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q. 257, 308</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition they acknowledge that because they had the indemnity, they did not have to form an opinion as to whether the Program Agreement was enforceable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Asher CX, Q. 236, 308</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. By letters dated September 1, 2009, Federated, purported to terminate the 1998 Broker Agreement and the 2004 Broker Agreement (the &ldquo;Termination Letters&rdquo;). Ken Keenan, the President of CNS wrote to Federated and stated &ldquo;This notice of termination is not in conformity with the agreement between Vancity and CNS, which called for an exclusive arrangement and two years notice of termination.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hayes Affidavit, Ex 83 and 84; Mottram Affidavit, Ex 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. RSA/CNS continued to write Insurance under the Program Agreement until terminated by Federated.</P>
<P>22. VCI and Co-op agreed in s. 6.10B of the Co-op Agreement that it would attempt to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; RSA/CNS's claims under the Program Agreement by offering to RSA/CNS a portfolio of &ldquo;some substandard auto business&rdquo; in exchange for a Release. RSA/CNS did not agree to this.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>SMR Tab 4 page 2A s.6.10B; CX JA&mdash;Q's 261&ndash;266, 273.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>23. The issues in this motion are:
<P1>a) Is this an appropriate matter for summary judgment; and</P1>
<P1>b) Did the Co-op Defendants, or one of them, induce VCI to breach the Program Agreement.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>24. RSA/CNS agree that the issue of whether the Co-op Defendants or one of them induced VCI to breach the Program Agreement does not require a trial and that it is an appropriate issue to be determined on a motion for summary judgment. The evidence available is sufficient for a fair and just determination of this issue.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hyrniak v Maudlin</SOC></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">INDUCING BREACH OF CONTRACT</TI>
<P>25. The broad parameters of the tort of inducing breach of contract are well established. In <CASEREF><SOC>Drouillard v Cogeco</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Drouillard v Cogeco Cable Inc.</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 322 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Ontario Court of Appeal sets out the four elements as follows:
<P1>a) there must be a valid and enforceable contract;</P1>
<P1>b) the party must be aware of the contract;</P1>
<P1>c) the party must intend to and actually procure a breach of that contract; and</P1>
<P1>d) damage must be suffered.</P1></P>
<P>26. RSA/CNS acknowledges that if this Court finds that the Program Agreement is not a valid and enforceable contract it can not succeed in its action against the Co-op Defendants. However, as set out in its factum in response to VCU's motion for summary judgment, there is overwhelming evidence that the Program Agreement is a valid and enforceable agreement.</P>
<P>27. The Co-op Defendants were certainly aware of the Program Agreement and its significant terms. They were aware that since November 2008, VCI and RSA/CNS were in fact operating under its terms and those terms were significantly different from the Old Agreements. Prior to closing they had reviewed the Draft Program Agreement and had been advised that RSA/CNS was insisting on a two-year termination. The fact that they may not have known the exact terms is irrelevant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><UNDER>Drouillard</UNDER>, Ibid, para. 26</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. Lord Denning in <CASEREF><SOC>Emerald Construction Co v Lowthian</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Emerald Construction Co. v. Lowthian</SOC></CASEREF> quoted in <CASEREF><SOC>Homelife Realty Services Inc. v. Homelife Performance Realty Inc.</SOC><CITE>2007 CanLII 54275</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 215</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> said the following:
<QUOTE><P>[215] ...that the parties [to a contract] had a right to have their contractual relations preserved inviolate without unlawful interference by others...Even if they did not know of the actual terms of the contract, but had the means of knowledge&mdash;which they deliberately disregarded&mdash;that would be enough. Like the man who turns a blind eye. So here, if the officers deliberately sought to get this contract terminated, heedless of its terms, regardless whether it was terminated by breach or not, they would do wrong. For it is unlawful for a third person to procure a breach of contract knowingly or recklessly, indifferent whether it is a breach of [sic] not. (<UNDER>Emerald Construction Co</UNDER>., quoted in <UNDER>Homelife Reality</UNDER>, followed in <CASEREF><SOC>McKenzie v Peel County</SOC></CASEREF>)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>29. The Alberta Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>369413 Alberta Ltd. v Pocklington</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>369413 Alberta Ltd. v. Pocklington</SOC><CITE>2000 ABCA 307 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>41, 45</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> said the following about the necessary intention:
<QUOTE><P>42 ...Turning a blind eye may include situations in which the defendant failed to seek advice or employ the means available to obtain the necessary knowledge. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Royal Bank of Canada v. Wilton</SOC><YEAR>1995</YEAR><CITE>165 A.R. 261</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the defendant was uncertain about the enforceability of a contract, had the &ldquo;means of knowledge&rdquo; to determine if a legitimate contract existed, but made no efforts to seek advice. This court found the defendant liable because he deliberately chose not to acquire the information, but proceeded on the basis that the contract was unenforceable. Similarly, when there are competing legal interpretations and the defendant adopts an interpretation which will interfere with the plaintiffs rights, the defendant &ldquo;must at least show that he was advised and honestly believed that he was legally entitled to take that course&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Swiss Bank v Lloyds Bank</SOC><CITE>[1979] Ch. 548</CITE><PAGENUM>at 580</PAGENUM><COURTJUR>Ch.D.</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>reversed on other grounds</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>[1982] A.C. 584</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>[1982] A.C. 604</CITE><COURTJUR>H.L.(E.)</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>45 ...Therefore, if the breach was a reasonable or foreseeable consequence of that transfer, or alternatively, if Pocklington completed the transfer recklessly, <BOLD>was wilfully blind to [<EM>page 127</EM>] its consequences, or was indifferent as to whether or not it caused a breach, the necessary intent element for the tort will be met.</BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. The effect of the Termination Letters was to terminate the Program Agreement. Because of the indemnity, the Co-op Defendants simply did not care that their actions would breach the Program Agreement. &ldquo;Indifference equals intent&rdquo;. (Drouillard).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In addition to Emerald Construction, Op Cit., see Drouillard Op Cit, para. 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. Finally, there is no doubt that RSA/CNS suffered damage as a result of the action by the Co-Op Defendants in breach the Program Agreement. It terminated RSA/CNS's issuing of policies by the latest December 10, 2009.</P>
<P>32. Although to this point the actual damages suffered by RSA/CNS is not an issue on this motion, it is clear that for the purpose of satisfying the requirement of the tort of inducing breach of contract RSA/CNS have suffered damage.</P>
<P>33. As the Ontario Court of Appeal said in <CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Metcalfe</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton (City) v. Metcalfe &amp; Mansfield Capital Corporation</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 156 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>54-55</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE><UNDER>:</UNDER>
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI><EM>Damage and damages are different concepts</EM></TI>
<P>[54] The City's position that damage occurred when the Devonshire notes matured also fails to appreciate the distinction between damage and damages. <EM>Damage</EM> is the loss needed to make out the cause of action. Insofar as it relates to a transaction induced by wrongful conduct, as I have explained, damage is the condition of being worse off than before entering into the transaction. <EM>Damages</EM>, on the other hand, is the monetary measure of the extent of that loss. All that the City had to discover to start the limitation period was <EM>damage</EM>.</P>
<P>[55] The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. Union of Icelandic Fish Producers Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2005 NSCA 145 (CanLII)</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>238 N.S.R. (2d) 145</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, approved a description of the distinction by A.I. Ogus in <EM>The Law of Damages</EM> (London, Butterworths, 1973), at p. 2:</P>
<P>The terms &ldquo;damage&rdquo; and &ldquo;damages&rdquo; have suffered from loose usage. Some writers and judges have used them as if they were synonymous. But &ldquo;damages&rdquo; should connote the <EM>sum of money payable by way of compensation</EM>..., while the use of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is best confined to instances where it refers to the <EM>injury inflicted</EM> by the tort or breach of contract...</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
