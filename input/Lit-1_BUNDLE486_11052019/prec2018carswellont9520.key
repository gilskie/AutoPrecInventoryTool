<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT,</BOLD> the Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;OMDC&rdquo;), appeals to the Court of Appeal from the order of the Divisional Court, <EM>per</EM> Associate Chief Justice Manocco, and Justices Nordheimer and Sachs, dated January 25, 2017, made at Toronto, Ontario, granting die application for judicial review and remitting the matter back to the OMDC for reconsideration.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS that the order be varied as follows:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. An order be granted dismissing the application;</P>
<P>2. The costs of this appeal and the underlying motion for leave to appeal; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL are as follows:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit</TI>
<P>1. The OMDC is an agency of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. It was established to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer tax credit programs in furtherance of that objective.</P>
<P>2. The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;OIDMTC&rdquo;) is a refundable tax credit for the development of eligible interactive digital media products in Ontario. If a product is eligible for the OIDMTC, the applicant corporation may claim a percentage of Ontario labour expenditures, and certain marketing and distribution expenditures incurred during the product's development.</P>
<P>3. Pursuant to section 93 of the <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, the OMDC is responsible for determining whether a corporation is eligible for the OIDMTC, and whether a product is an eligible product for the OIDMTC.</P>
<P>4. Section 34(1) of O Reg 37/09, made under the <EM>Taxation Act 2007</EM>, specifies that an eligible product must be an &ldquo;interactive digital media product.&rdquo; Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an interactive digital media product, the primary purpose of the product must be to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; Products that are determined by the OMDC to be primarily promotional in nature do hot qualify for the tax credit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.'s Application for the OIDMTC</TI>
<P>5. In April 2014, Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. (&ldquo;Pong Marketing&rdquo;) applied for the OIDMTC with respect to 15 &ldquo;casino-style&rdquo; sweepstakes game products (&ldquo;the sweepstakes games&rdquo;). These sweepstakes games were developed to be licenced to third party retailers, as part of a promotional program. Following its review of the content contained within the sweepstakes games and information provided by Pong Marketing, the OMDC determined that the 15 sweepstakes games did not satisfy the eligibility requirements set out in section 34(1), because their primary purpose was not to educate, inform, or entertain the user. Rather, the OMDC determined that the primary purpose of the sweepstakes games was to promote the sale of phone cards.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Judicial Review of the OMDC Decision</TI>
<P>6. Pong Marketing sought judicial review of the OMDC decision that the 15 sweepstakes games were ineligible. Pong Marketing argued that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) was unreasonable, and that the OMDC had failed to provide sufficient reasons for the decision.</P>
<P>7. The Divisional Court released a split decision on January 25, 2017, granting the application.</P>
<P>8. In its decision, the majority allowed the application, finding that the OMDC's interpretation of section 34(1) was unreasonable, holding that the only reasonable interpretation of section 34(1) exclusively &ldquo;requires the OMDC to look at the primary purpose of the game from the perspective of the player&rdquo; in isolation of considering additional factors. The majority concluded that the OMDC had unreasonably considered the purpose for which the sweepstakes games were developed, which it held was an irrelevant consideration.</P>
<P>9. In addition, the majority held that even if the OMDC interpretation of section 34(1) was reasonable, a residual presumption that operates in favour of the taxpayer should be applied in the interpretation of taxation statutes. The majority held that this presumption should have been applied by the OMDC in this case.</P>
<P>10. Finally, the majority rejected Pong Marketing's argument that the reasons provided by the OMDC were insufficient.</P>
<P>11. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the application on the basis that deference should be afforded to the OMDC in its interpretation of die eligibility criteria under section 34(1). The dissent concluded that it was reasonable for the OMDC to consider the intended purpose of the product at the time of its creation when attempting to determine the primary purpose of the product while being operated. Accordingly, the OMDC's determination that the primary purpose of the sweepstakes games was to promote the sale of phone cards based on, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the purpose for which the sweepstakes games were developed, was entitled to deference.</P>
<P>12. Further, the dissenting judge noted that the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer has a limited purpose, and is only applied if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation using the modem approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, the residual presumption has no application as the OMDC was able to resolve the issue without needing to resort to the residual presumption.</P>
<P>13. The dissenting judge agreed with the majority that the OMDC's reasons were sufficient.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Leave to Appeal Granted</TI>
<P>14. On February 13, 2017, the OMDC moved for leave to appeal from the order of the Divisional Court granting the Respondent's application for judicial review.</P>
<P>15. On May 12, 2017, the Court of Appeal granted the Appellant's motion for leave to appeal.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI>The Majority Made Significant Errors of Law</TI>
<P>16. The majority erred in failing to give any deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and as such erroneously applied a standard of correctness;</P>
<P>17. The majority erred in holding that it was unreasonable for the OMDC to consider the purpose for which the products were developed when assessing whether the sweepstakes games' predominant purpose was promotional;</P>
<P>18. The majority erred in failing to give weight to the evidence showing that the OMDC did consider the promotional content of the sweepstakes games presented to users while in operation;</P>
<P>19. The majority erred in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case, and that it would favour the Respondent;</P>
<P>20. Section 93 of the <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, S.O. 2007 c. 11 Sched. A;</P>
<P>21. Section 34 of O Reg 37/09; and</P>
<P>22. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. Clause 6(1)(a) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, provides for an appeal from an order of the Divisional Court, on a question that is not a question of fact alone, with leave of the Court of Appeal;</P>
<P>2. The questions before the Court are not questions of fact alone;</P>
<P>3. Leave to appeal has been granted; and</P>
<P>4. There are no other facts relevant to establishing jurisdiction.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDENT (APPELLANT), ONTARIO MEDIA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;IDENTITY OF APPELLANT, PRIOR COURT &amp; RESULT</TI>
<P>1. The Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;OMDC&rdquo;) appeals from the judgment of the Divisional Court dated January 25, 2017. The Divisional Court granted the respondent, Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.'s (&ldquo;Pong Marketing&rdquo;), application for judicial review of the OMDC's decision that 15 &ldquo;casino-style&rdquo; sweepstakes games are ineligible for the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;OIDMTC&rdquo;). Pong Marketing's OIDMTC application was remitted back to the OMDC for reconsideration.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART 2&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. The OMDC is an agency of Ontario's Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, that was established to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer the OIDMTC in furtherance of that objective. To be eligible for the OIDMTC, s. 34(1) of O Reg 37/09 (the &ldquo;Regulation&rdquo;) under the <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, S.O. 2007 c. 11 Sched A (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), requires that a product's primary purpose be to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; Products that are primarily promotional do not meet the primary purpose test.</P>
<P>3. On its review of Pong Marketing's application, the OMDC found that the primary purpose of Pong Marketing's products are to promote the sale of long-distance telephone calling cards, not to educate, inform or entertain the user. The OMDC assessed the products' primary purpose by reviewing both the developer's intended purpose when developing the sweepstakes games and by analyzing the products from the user's perspective during gameplay.</P>
<P>4. In a split decision, the majority of the Divisional Court held that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation was unreasonable because it considered the intended purpose of the product when it was being developed. Instead, the majority found that the only reasonable interpretation of the Regulation requires the purpose of the sweepstakes games to be assessed exclusively from the perspective of the user during gameplay. The majority further held, in the alternative, that even if the OMDC's decision was reasonable, the residual presumption applicable to tax legislation would require resolving any ambiguity in the interpretation of the Regulation in favour of the taxpayer.</P>
<P>5. The OMDC submits that although the Divisional Court correctly identified the standard of review as reasonableness, the majority misapplied the standard in their analysis. By failing to consider whether the OMDC's decision falls within a range of possible outcomes, the majority failed to grant deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute and arguably applied a standard of correctness. As held by the dissenting judge, it was reasonable for the OMDC to consider, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the intended purpose of the product at the time of its creation when assessing the primary purpose of the product. The OMDC's decision in this regard is entitled to deference.</P>
<P>6. Moreover, the majority misinterpreted s. 34(1) of the Regulation. The majority's interpretation of the Regulation is too narrow and reads in limitations to the scope of the provision that undermine the legislative intent.</P>
<P>7. Alternatively, even if the majority correctly interpreted s. 34(1) of the Regulation, and assuming that the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute was unreasonable, the OMDC's decision on the respondent's eligibility for the OIDMTC remains reasonable. This is because the majority's decision ignored key evidence showing that the OMDC did in fact consider the promotional content embedded in each sweepstakes game from the users' perspective during gameplay, as required by the majority's interpretation of the provision at issue on the appeal.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See paras. 66&ndash;69 in Part 4 of this Factum.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. Finally, and in any event, the majority misapplied the residual presumption to the circumstances of this case. As noted by the dissenting judge, the residual presumption has a &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; role to play in the interpretation of tax legislation and should not apply in a case such as this one where the OMDC's interpretation is reasonable and is supported by the intent and wording of the legislative and regulatory scheme.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Divisional Court, dated January 25, 2017 [&ldquo;Divisional Court Decision&rdquo;], Appeal Book and Compendium of the OMDC [&ldquo;OMDC AB &amp; C&rdquo;], Tab 3, p. 27, paras. 87-88</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation as allowing it to assess a product's primary purpose by considering both the developer's intention during development and the user's experience during gameplay is reasonable. The OMDC's finding that the purpose of the sweepstakes games is primarily promotional is also justified, transparent and intelligible in light of the evidentiary record before it. For the foregoing reasons, the OMDC's decision warrants deference and its decision should be reinstated.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART 3&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The OMDC and the OIDMTC</TI>
<P>10. The OMDC is an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. It was established in 2000 to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer tax credit programs in furtherance of that objective.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 12, para. 2</P1>
<P1>O Reg 672/00, ss. 1, 2, 3, 4, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>11. The OIDMTC is a refundable tax credit for the development of eligible interactive digital media products in Ontario. If a product is eligible for the OIDMTC, the applicant corporation may claim a percentage of its Ontario labour expenditures, and certain marketing and distribution expenditures incurred during the product's development. As a refundable tax credit, the amount of the credit, less any taxes payable, is paid to the corporation.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 12, para. 8</P1></P>
<P>12. The OIDMTC is jointly administered by the OMDC and the Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;). Corporations can submit an application to the OMDC for a Certificate of Eligibility in respect of a product, pursuant to s. 93 of the Act. The OMDC reviews the application, and if the product meets the legislative requirements, the OMDC will issue a Certificate of Eligibility certifying that the product is eligible for the OIDMTC. The corporation can then submit its certificate to the CRA, which conducts an audit and issues a refund in cases where the corporation is entitled to a refund.

<P>13. Pong Marketing's OIDMTC application submitted to the OMDC is governed by s. 93 of the Act, and s. 34 of the Regulation, as it then read.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 34(1) of the Regulation has been amended. Effective March 2017, the relevant portion of the amended provision now reads as follows:

<P>O Reg 37/09, s 34(1). as amended, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. Under s. 93 of the Act, the OMDC is responsible for determining whether a corporation is eligible for the OIDMTC, and whether a product is an eligible product for the OIDMTC.</P>
<P>15. A &ldquo;qualifying corporation&rdquo; must develop an eligible product to qualify for the OIDMTC. Eligible products are defined at s. 93(14) of the Act:

<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Pong Marketing's Application and Game Content</TI>
<P>18. On April 16, 2014, Pong Marketing applied to the OMDC for the OIDMTC (&ldquo;the application&rdquo;). The application concerned 15 sweepstakes games (&ldquo;the sweepstakes games&rdquo;) that Pong Marketing developed between February 2011 and March 2013. The total tax credit being sought by Pong Marketing is approximately $2 million.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 12, paras. 3-4</P1></P>
<P>19. The sweepstakes games are &ldquo;casino-style&rdquo; slot-based games that work by sequentially delivering sweepstakes prizes to the player upon the commitment of &ldquo;sweepstakes points.&rdquo; A player receives sweepstakes points each time he or she purchases a telephone card. A player can also receive points by requesting entry into a game without making a purchase. While the outcome of the game is predetermined, the number of points affects a participant's chance of winning a prize.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 13, para. 16</P1></P>
<P>20. The games are intended to be licensed to third party retailers, including cafe owners, and owners of bars and restaurants, as part of a promotional program to generate revenue. The games are operated through a gaming platform that is licensed to retailers by Pong Marketing.

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The OMDC Decision</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The OMDC's Initial Review of Pong Marketing's Application</TI>
<P>23. The OMDC's initial assessment of Pong Marketing's development, licensing and marketing documents was that the sweepstakes games did not qualify for the OIDMTC because it appeared that the products' purpose was primarily promotional. In particular, the OMDC was concerned that the sweepstakes games were produced for the primary purpose of selling long distance telephone cards. The OMDC expressed this concern through correspondence dated July 29, 2015.
<P1>Correspondence through the Online Application Portal [&ldquo;OAP&rdquo;] from OMDC to Pong Marketing, July 29, 2015, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 9, p. 71</P1></P>
<P>24. Pong Marketing's documents were assessed for key factors, including why and how a product was developed, what audience or target market it was developed for, and to whom the product was marketed; this process included a review of Pong Marketing's template licensing agreement, website content, and screenshots of the sweepstakes games themselves.
<P1>Letter from Jennifer Blitz to William Dawson, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. 2013 File No. 15214-01-TXM&rdquo; (November 30, 2015), OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 10, p. 81</P1></P>
<P>25. In arriving at its initial decision, the OMDC wrote to Pong Marketing and cited several examples from their application materials that demonstrated the sweepstakes games' primarily promotional purpose. By way of example, the OMDC referred to the manner in which the sweepstakes games and the system through which they are delivered are described in the template licensing agreement filed as part of the application:
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>1.0</N><TI>Definitions:</TI>
<P>Delivery System: loyalty platform software...supplied in any way by the Licensor [Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.] to the Licensee <UNDER>for the use in the sale and promotion of the products or the loyalty program.</UNDER></P>
<P>Sweepstakes Games: <UNDER>A means of promotion to aid in the sale of long distance calling cards and other related products and services</UNDER>.</P>

<P1>Template Licencing Agreement&mdash;&ldquo;Amazing 8s&rdquo;, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 11, p. 88</P1></P>
<P>26. The OMDC also referenced material from Pong Marketing's website, which describes sweepstakes games and Pong Marketing's business model in the following terms:
<QUOTE><P>Welcome!</P>
<P>Pong Marketing is a Telecommunication company in the business of delivering a <UNDER>promotional sweepstakes system to enhance the sale of its pre-paid long distance phone time.</UNDER> [emphasis added]</P>
<P>In order to compete against the industries top competitors in the phone card market (i.e., AT&amp;T, Verizon), Pong Marketing has introduced <UNDER>a promotional program that includes sweepstakes games</UNDER>. [emphasis in the OMDC correspondence]</P>

This form of marketing acts as an incentive so that the purchase of its card will be favoured over those of its competitors.</BOLD> [emphasis in the OMDC correspondence]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Correspondence through the OAP from, July 29, 2015, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 9, p. 71</P1></P>
<P>27. The OMDC explained to Pong Marketing that to be eligible for the tax credit, the purpose of the product must be primarily to educate, inform or entertain the user. Products deemed to be primarily promotional do not qualify. The OMDC offered Pong Marketing the opportunity to file additional documentation that might address the OMDC's concern that the purpose of the sweepstakes games is primarily promotional.
<P1>Correspondence through the OAP from OMDC to Pong Marketing, July 29, 2015, OMDC AB &amp; C, p. 72</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>Further Documentation Provided by Pong Marketing</TI>
<P>28. Pong Marketing responded to the OMDC's concerns by submitting a document entitled &ldquo;business model clarification.&rdquo; The OMDC reviewed this document and advised Pong Marketing that it did not address the concerns that the OMDC had raised, and in any event, it did not constitute original development documentation. Pong Marketing filed further supporting documentation for review on September 24, 2015, including:
<P1>(a) Game videos from each of the 15 sweepstake games;</P1>
<P1>(b) Pictures from internet cafes where the games were being played;</P1>
<P1>(c) Marketing and game revenue materials</P1>
<P1>(d) A YouTube demonstration video</P1>
<P1>(e) Screen shots from a &ldquo;Pong Studios&rdquo; website.</P1>
<P1>Pong Marketing's Supplementary Filing, filed by Pong Marketing on Sept. 24, 2015, Exhibit Book of the Respondent (Appellant), Tabs 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d and 5e, pp. 518&ndash;697</P1></P>
<P>29. The game videos provided as part of the additional documents allowed the OMDC to view the content embedded in each of the sweepstakes games from the perspective of the user during gameplay. Additional items, such as photos of the venues where the sweepstakes games are operated, and the demonstration video that may be viewed by users, provided additional insight into the products' use from the user's perspective.</P>
<P>30. The OMDC reviewed these materials, and in correspondence dated October 23, 2015, advised Pong Marketing that these documents did not alleviate its concern that the primary purpose of the sweepstakes games is promotional. As part of its reasons, the OMDC cited the prominent in-game promotional content in each of the 15 sweepstakes games that users viewed during gameplay. The reasons provided by the OMDC are as follows:
<P1>(a) There are specific examples from each game product of the prominent in-game promotional content enticing users to purchase additional time for long-distance phone cards;</P1>
<P1>(b) Some of the internet caf&ea; pictures contained long distance phone card signs;</P1>
<P1>(c) Most of the marketing material submitted was not related to the sweepstakes games at issue in the OIDMTC application;</P1>
<P1>(d) The YouTube video contained an animated character that congratulates the user on purchasing a phone card; and</P1>
<P1>(e) With respect to the website, the Pong Studios website screenshots submitted on September 24<SUP>th</SUP> did not match the licencing agreements submitted with the sweepstakes games. The OMDC also noted that the materials from the Pong Marketing website, as of July 2015 and as referenced above, did not match the licencing agreements.</P1>
<P1>Correspondence through the OAP from OMDC to Pong Marketing, Oct. 23, 2015, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 9, pp. 74&ndash;77</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii.</N><TI>The OMDC's Determination that the Primary Purpose of the Sweepstakes Games is Promotional</TI>
<P>31. At Pong Marketing's request, the OMDC reviewed the application again. At the conclusion of the review, the OMDC determined that the primary purpose of the sweepstakes games is promotional.
<P1>Letter from OMDC to Pong Marketing, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. 2013 File No. 15214-01-TXM&rdquo; (November 30, 2015), OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 10, pp. 81&ndash;86</P1></P>
<P>32. The OMDC issued a formal letter of ineligibility on December 11, 2015. After receipt of this letter, Pong Marketing commenced an application for judicial review seeking, in part, to quash the OMDC's decision.
<P1>Letter from OMDC to Pong Marketing, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. [...]&rdquo; (December 11, 2015), OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 4, p. 28</P1>
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 12, para. 7</P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>The Divisional Court Decision</TI>
<P>33. The majority of the Divisional Court allowed Pong Marketing's application and remitted the matter back to the OMDC for reconsideration. Writing for the majority, Associate Chief Justice Marrocco (Nordheimer J., concurring) held that the standard of review on the judicial review was reasonableness and that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation was unreasonable. The majority held that the only reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1) requires the OMDC to look at &ldquo;the primary purpose of the game from the perspective of the player&rdquo; because the section refers to the &ldquo;characteristics of the game when the user is playing it.&rdquo; In ruling that there was only one reasonable interpretation to s. 34(1), the majority effectively applied a correctness standard to the OMDC's interpretation.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 18, para. 37</P1></P>
<P>34. The majority held that any consideration of the developer's motivation for developing the game is irrelevant to the OMDC's assessment of whether the purpose of the sweepstakes games, while in operation, is primarily promotional. This reasoning flows from the majority's literal reading of the definition of &ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; under the Regulation:
<QUOTE><P>The definition focuses on the time when the application files and data files are operated together by the user <UNDER>and provides that one of their characteristics at that moment is that their primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user</UNDER>. The only time the user operates those files is when he or she is playing a Sweepstakes game. The primary purpose of the applicant when creating or licensing the product is a different inquiry. [emphasis original]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 17, paras. 32-33</P1></P>
<P>35. Accordingly, the majority regarded any statements from Pong Marketing's website or template licensing agreement, used as a means of identifying the developer's intention when developing the sweepstakes games, as being unhelpful in determining the primary purpose of the product when it is being operated.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 18, paras. 37-38</P1></P>
<P>36. The majority further held that even if the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) is reasonable, a residual presumption that applies in favour of the taxpayer in the interpretation of taxation statutes should have been applied by the OMDC in this case.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 18, para. 43</P1></P>
<P>37. By contrast, in her dissenting reasons, Justice Sachs would have denied the application. Contrary to the approach taken by the majority, Her Honour held that the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute warranted deference. Justice Sachs held that a reasonable interpretation of the legislation allows the OMDC to consider the purpose for which the product is developed in determining the product's purpose while being operated:
<QUOTE><P>[...] it is not unreasonable when objectively assessing the primary purpose of a product while it is being operated to have regard to what the intended purpose of the product was when it was being developed. After all, it is the product's primary purpose that governs the analysis and it is reasonable to assume that a successfully developed product, when it is being operated, will fulfill the primary purpose for which it was developed.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 26, para. 84</P1></P>
<P>38. Further, Justice Sachs noted that the legislation specifically contemplates that an eligible product may have multiple purposes while it is being operated by the user. As such, it is the OMDC's statutory responsibility to determine the primary purpose of the product. In this case, Her Honour noted that the OMDC is entitled to rely on its review of the sweepstakes games, among other things, to find that the primary purpose of the products while they are being operated is to encourage users to buy calling cards, and not to entertain.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 27 para. 85</P1></P>
<P>39. With respect to the residual presumption, Justice Sachs found that the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer serves a &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; purpose, and is only applied if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation using the modem approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, Sachs J. held that the residual presumption has no application as the OMDC resolved the issue without needing to resort to the residual presumption.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART 3&mdash;THE ISSUES</TI>
<P>40. The issues to be determined on this appeal are as follows:
<P1>(a) Did the Divisional Court err in failing to give any deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and as such, effectively apply a standard of correctness?</P1>
<P1>(b) Did the Divisional Court err by misinterpreting s. 34(1) of the Regulation such that the scope of the provision is unnecessarily limited?</P1>
<P1>(c) Did the Divisional Court err in failing to give weight to evidence showing that the OMDC did consider the promotional content of the sweepstakes games presented to users while in operation?</P1>
<P1>(d) Did the Divisional Court err in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case and that it would favour the respondent?</P1></P></BLOCK2>

Although the Divisional Court correctly identified the standard of review on the judicial review as reasonableness, the majority's decision misapplies the reasonableness standard when analysing the OMDC's decision. Rather than assessing the OMDC's decision against the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility to determine whether it falls within a range of possible, acceptable and defensible outcomes that were open to it on the evidence, the majority substituted its own interpretation of the Regulation for that of the OMDC. In this way, the majority effectively applied a standard of correctness and failed to grant the OMDC's decision the deference to which it is entitled.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>Deference should be afforded on a Reasonableness Standard of Review</TI>
<P>43. Both the majority and the dissent correctly identified the standard of review of the OMDC's decision in this case as reasonableness. In so doing, the majority came to the same conclusion as the Divisional Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Venngo Inc. v Ontario Media Development Corp. and Attorney General of Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>, which held that the appropriate standard of review for the OMDC's interpretation of the very statutory provision at issue on this appeal is reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The application in <EM>Venngo</EM> was governed by s. 43.11 of the <EM>Corporations Tax Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c C40, and s. 906 of Reg. 183 under the Act, as they then read.

<P>44. Under the reasonableness standard of review, deference is the animating principle. The OMDC's decision can only be considered unreasonable if &ldquo;there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the [decision-maker] from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.&rdquo; The decision-maker's decision may be reasonable even if its explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling.

<P>45. This Court has previously warned that it is a &ldquo;grave misconception&rdquo; for reviewing courts to determine the reasonableness of an administrative decision-maker's decision by examining whether it &ldquo;deviates from the correct decision by more than a reasonable margin of error...&rdquo; No single outcome can be regarded as the correct one when examined for reasonableness.

<P>46. In the particular context of statutory interpretation, the reviewing court cannot substitute its view of the interpretation and application of the statute for that of the decision-maker's reasonably held view. The Supreme Court of Canada articulated this proposition forcefully in <CASEREF><SOC>Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>At the outset it is helpful to contrast judicial review according to the standard of reasonableness with the fundamentally different process of reviewing a decision for correctness. When undertaking a correctness review, the court may undertake its own reasoning process to arrive at the result it judges correct. In contrast, <UNDER>when deciding whether an administrative action was unreasonable, a court should not at any point ask itself what the correct decision would have been.</UNDER> Applying the standard of reasonableness gives effect to the legislative intention that a specialized body will have the primary responsibility of deciding the issue according to its own process and for its own reasons. <UNDER>The standard of reasonableness does not imply that a decision-maker is merely afforded a &ldquo;margin of error&rdquo; around what the court believes is the correct result.</UNDER> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>

<P>47. The OMDC is a specialized agency with expertise in the interpretation and application of the relevant statutory provisions of the Act and Regulation. The question of whether the &ldquo;primary purpose&rdquo; of a promotional game is to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user&rdquo; is at the core of the OMDC's function.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Venngo Inc. v Ontario Media Development Corp. and Attorney General of Ontario</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 1036</CITE><COURTJUR>Div Ct</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 1, OMDC BOA, Tab 5</P1></P>
<P>48. The OMDC determined that the sweepstakes games were developed primarily as promotional vehicles for selling telephone cards. This decision was reasonably made having considered each of the sweepstakes games while in operation from the user's perspective, in addition to the developer's intention when developing the sweepstakes games. This conclusion was intelligible and justified based on the wording of the Regulation, intent of the Act, and the evidentiary record.</P>
<P>49. The majority's decision did not examine whether the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) and its ultimate decision on the application fell within a range of possible outcomes. Instead, the majority substituted their interpretation of s. 34(1) for that of the OMDC, and, as set out below, ignored key evidence showing that the OMDC did consider the promotional content of the products presented to the users while in operation.</P>
<P>50. On its review of the application, the OMDC-concluded that Pong Marketing developed the sweepstakes games to be used as promotional platforms by licensees to promote products to the end user of the game. As found by the OMDC, Pong Marketing's template licensing agreement and website content demonstrates how Pong Marketing anticipated the sweepstakes games would be used by the licensee.</P>
<P>51. Based on the materials submitted, it was reasonable for the OMDC to conclude that the sweepstakes games were designed by Pong Marketing to be used as loyalty platform software by licensees to market their products (i.e., phone cards) to the user.</P>
<P>52. It is important to note that the OMDC's interpretation and application of s. 34(1) does not assume that users cannot be entertained when operating Pong Marketing's products. As noted in Justice Sachs' dissenting reasons, the legislation specifically contemplates that products can serve multiple purposes. However, the Legislature delegated responsibility to the OMDC to use its expertise in the subject matter and in its interpretation of its home statute to administer the tax credit. Where it has done so reasonably, as it has here, the OMDC is entitled to deference.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 27, para. 85</P1></P>
<P>53. By failing to consider whether the OMDC's interpretation was justifiable, transparent, and intelligible based on the materials submitted by Pong Marketing, the majority failed to review the decision on a reasonableness standard and instead effectively applied a standard of correctness. Where the expertise of the OMDC is engaged, as it is here, deference must be granted and respect given to the Legislature's decision to leave such matters in the hands of the OMDC to draw on its particular expertise and experience.

<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The Rules of Statutory Interpretation</TI>
<P>55. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly endorsed Driedger's modem approach to statutory interpretation:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he words of an <EM>Act</EM> are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the <EM>Act</EM>, the object of the <EM>Act</EM>, and the intention of Parliament.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Elmer A. Driedger, <EM>Construction of Statutes</EM>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at p. 87, OMDC BOA, Tab 10 (excerpt)</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v Rex</SOC><CITE>[2002] SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF>, OMDC BOA, Tab 11 (excerpt)</P1></P>
<P>56. The modem approach to statutory interpretation requires the court to: (i) examine the words of the provision in their ordinary and grammatical sense; (ii) consider the entire context that the provision is located within; and (iii) consider whether the proposed interpretation produces a just and reasonable result.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v Rex</SOC><CITE>[2002] SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, OMDC BOA, Tab 11 (excerpt)</P1>

<P>57. The factors comprising the &ldquo;entire context&rdquo; include the history of the provision at issue, its place in the overall scheme of the Act, the object of the Act itself, and the Legislature's intent in enacting the Act as a whole and the particular provision at issue. A just and reasonable result promotes applications of the Act that advance its purpose and avoids applications that are &ldquo;foolish and pointless.&rdquo;
<P1>Pierre-Andr&ea; C&oc;t&ea;, <EM>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</EM>, 3rd ed. at p. 387, OMDC BOA, Tab 13 (excerpt)</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>The Majority's Interpretation of s. 34(1) is Too Narrow</TI>
<P>58. At the time of the application, s. 34(1) of the Regulation read as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>34.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In this section,</SSECP>
<SSECP>&ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; means a combination of one or more application files and one or more data files, all in a digital format, that are integrated and are intended to be operated together and that have the following characteristics when they are being operated:
<PARA><N>1.</N><PARAP><UNDER>Their</UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user.</PARAP>
<PARAP>[...]</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1>O. Reg. 37/09, s. 34(1), Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>59. For the majority, the central concern with interpreting s. 34(1) as allowing a consideration of the developer's purpose, as favoured by the OMDC, is that the &ldquo;developer's fundamental purpose&rdquo; may weigh negatively against their eligibility for the tax credit. This, they held, is inconsistent with the Legislature's intention to use the tax credit to assist high technology, knowledge-based industries. The majority interpreted s. 34(1) as avoiding this problem by focusing instead on the characteristics of the product from the subjective perspective of the user while the user plays the game. Respectfully, this interpretation is too narrow.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, pp. 17-18, paras 35 and 37</P1></P>
<P>60. When read in its entire context and in the grammatical and ordinary sense, s. 34(1) does not prohibit consideration of the purpose for which a product is developed. It is evident on a plain reading of s. 34(1) that this provision can be interpreted to include the purpose for which the product was developed. The reference to &ldquo;they&rdquo; in &ldquo;when <UNDER>they</UNDER> are being operated ... <UNDER>Their</UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user&rdquo;, is a reference to the product's purpose and not the user's purpose. The user's purpose will always be subjective. Users may play games to be entertained or to benefit from the products the games promote, or both. But the developer's purpose in developing the products can be ascertained from the sweepstakes games, licensing agreements, and promotional materials, and is necessarily relevant to determining the sweepstakes games' overall purpose while they are being operated.</P>
<P>61. Additionally, focus on the purpose for which the sweepstakes games were developed is more consistent with the purpose for which the OIDMTC is made available. Contrary to the majority's premise, and as correctly identified in the dissenting reasons, the tax credit is intended to facilitate growth in the cultural media sector and not the interactive digital media industry writ large. Determining whether a product is eligible for the OIDMTC is a task that has been delegated to the OMDC the OMDC's mandate is to &ldquo;foster the development and enhancement of the cultural media industry in Ontario.&rdquo; This mandate is not meant to create jobs in the digital media industry generally, but rather to &ldquo;create jobs in particular sectors&rdquo; of that industry.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 25, para. 77</P1></P>
<P>62. For this reason, the Regulation requires an assessment of the product's purpose to ensure that it is intended primarily to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; If the intention was simply to create jobs through a broadly administered tax credit, then all interactive digital media products, and in particular all digital interactive games, regardless of their predominant purpose, would qualify. This is not what the Legislature intended.</P>
<P>63. Viewed in this way, there is a logical link between a product developer's intention and the end product's operation. As stated by Sachs J. in dissent, it is &ldquo;reasonable to assume that a product when operated successfully will fulfill the primary purpose for which it was developed.&rdquo; When the primary purpose of a product is the focal point for determining eligibility for a tax credit, it is reasonable to refer to the developer's intention as the OMDC did in this case.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 26, para. 84</P1></P>
<P>64. Accordingly, the OMDC considered both the developer's purpose when designing the sweepstakes game and its intended use while in operation by the user. Both of these factors were considered by the OMDC to determine the product's primary purpose. The OMDC reasonably concluded that the sweepstakes games were designed with the expectation that they would be used by licensees to promote the sale of telephone cards to the end users of the games. The OMDC reached this conclusion based on Pong Marketing's application materials, as described above.</P>
<P>65. By focusing on the subjective purpose for which a user may play one of the sweepstakes games, the majority interpreted s. 34(1) too narrowly and without reference to the wording of the provision as a whole and the purpose of the OIDMTC.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Consideration Given to the OMDC's Review of the Promotional Content of the Sweepstakes Games Presented to Users While in Operation</UNDER></TI>
<P>66. In the alternative, even if the majority was correct that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) was unreasonable and the product developer's motivation for developing a product is an irrelevant consideration, the OMDC's decision is still reasonable.</P>
<P>67. The majority held that the only reasonable interpretation of the provision involves an assessment of the product from the user's perspective during gameplay and that any consideration of the developer's intention when developing the game is irrelevant to the primary purpose analysis. Even if the majority correctly interpreted s. 34(1), the majority failed to consider key evidence that the OMDC <UNDER>did</UNDER> consider the user's perspective during gameplay in carrying out the primary purpose analysis.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 17, para. 33</P1></P>
<P>68. In its correspondence to Pong Marketing, the OMDC details its observations regarding the promotional content embedded in each of the sweepstakes games as it appears to users during gameplay. The predominant nature of the promotional content identified by the OMDC includes, among other things, popup bubbles enticing users to add additional time to their telephone card accounts by purchasing more play time, and graphic images of buttons requesting users to &ldquo;Buy $1 More Time&rdquo;, designed to be visible to users during the entire duration of regular (non-bonus) gameplay.
<P1>Correspondence through the OAP from October 23, 2015, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 9, pp. 74&ndash;76. <BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This citation contains the full list of embedded promotional content identified by the OMDC in each of the 15 sweepstakes games.</P1></P>
<P>69. It is abundantly clear from the record that the OMDC's primary purpose analysis did consider the products as at the time that &ldquo;the user is playing it&rdquo; and not only at the &ldquo;moment it is created or licensed.&rdquo; This error was fundamental to the majority's decision.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 18, para. 37</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>No Residual Presumption Applies in the Circumstances of the Present Case</UNDER></TI>
<P>70. The majority further erred in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case and that it would favour Pong Marketing. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the residual presumption has a limited purpose and must only be applied in &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; cases where application of the modem approach to statutory interpretation does not resolve the meaning of the legislation. The present case is not one where the residual presumption applies.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The Residual Presumption Applies only in Exceptional Circumstances</TI>
<P>71. There is no longer any rule of statutory interpretation that requires ambiguities in tax related statutes to be read in favour of taxpayers. If there are two interpretations, the more reasonable one must prevail. Where there are two interpretations and one cannot be said to be the more reasonable than the other, the choice should then be resolved in favour of the taxpayer. The existence of competing interpretations alone does not establish ambiguity.

<P>72. As such, the application of the residual presumption is necessarily limited to &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; circumstances. In <CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon Secours</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Notre-Dame de Bon Secours</EM>&rdquo;), the Supreme Court of Canada explained the limitation of the residual presumption as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[...] first, recourse to the presumption in the taxpayer's favour is indicated when a court is compelled to choose between two valid interpretations, and second, this <UNDER>presumption</UNDER> is <UNDER>clearly residual</UNDER> and should play an exceptional part in the interpretation of tax legislation.

<P>73. More recently, in <CASEREF><SOC>Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v Ontario (Minister of Finance)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court cited <EM>Notre-Dame de Bon Secours</EM> with approval and confirmed the exceptional role that the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer plays in the interpretation of taxation statutes:
<QUOTE><P>[...] Any doubt about the meaning of a taxation statute must be reasonable, and no recourse to the presumption lies unless the usual rules of interpretation have been applied, <UNDER>to no avail</UNDER>, in an attempt to discern the meaning of the provision at issue.

<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>There is No Ambiguity in the Interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation Warranting Application of the Residual Presumption</TI>
<P>74. The majority erred in their application of the residual presumption in the circumstances of this case. In their reasons, the majority declined to resort to the residual presumption because they found on an application of the modem approach to statutory interpretation that the OMDC's interpretation of the Regulation was unreasonable.</P>
<P>75. The majority held, in the alternative, that even if the OMDC's decision were reasonable, the application of the residual presumption requires the OMDC to apply the reasonable interpretation of the Regulation which is more favourable to the taxpayer.
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 18, para. 43</P1></P>
<P>76. In this circumstance, the application of the residual presumption is incongruent with the principles governing judicial review on a reasonableness standard of review.</P>
<P>77. In <CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court held that where there are two reasonable competing interpretations of a decision-maker's home statute, the reviewing court must side with the decision-maker:
<QUOTE><P>The bottom line here, then, is that the Commission holds the interpretative upper hand: under reasonableness review, we defer to <UNDER>any</UNDER> reasonable interpretation adopted by an administrative decision maker, <UNDER>even if</UNDER> other reasonable interpretations may exist. Because the legislature charged the administrative decision maker rather than the courts with &ldquo;administer[ing] and apply[ing]&rdquo; its home statute (<EM>Pezim</EM>, at p. 596), it is the decision maker, first and foremost, that has the discretion to resolve a statutory uncertainty by adopting any interpretation that the statutory language can reasonably bear. Judicial deference in such instances is itself a principle of modem statutory interpretation. [emphasis original]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 SCR 895</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, OMDC BOA, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>78. Because deference is owed to the decision-maker on a reasonableness standard, Pong Marketing has the high burden of proving not only that its interpretation is reasonable, but that OMDC's interpretation is <EM>unreasonable</EM>. The Supreme Court framed the burden as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Accordingly, the appellant's burden here is not only to show that her competing interpretation is reasonable, but also that the [decision-maker's] interpretation is <EM>unreasonable</EM>. And that she has not done. Here, the [decision-maker], with the benefit of its expertise, chose the interpretation it did. And because that interpretation has not been shown to be an unreasonable one, there is no basis for us to interfere on judicial review&mdash;even in the face of a competing reasonable interpretation. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 SCR 895</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, OMDC BOA, Tab 7</P1></P>
<P>79. In the present case, the majority's resort to the residual presumption in a circumstance where the OMDC's decision is assumed to be reasonable is at odds with both the principles underlying the residual presumption, as well as the well-established administrative law principles guiding the standard of reasonableness.</P>
<P>80. If the OMDC's decision is reasonable, then by definition there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the legislation requiring resort to the residual presumption; it is necessarily implied that no unresolvable dispute exists regarding the meaning of the provision. As such, the decision-maker's interpretation falls within a range of possible outcomes and is thus owed deference.</P>
<P>81. For the foregoing reasons, Sachs J. properly disagreed with the majority's reliance on the residual presumption as an alternative. Upon restating the &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; role played by the residual presumption, Sachs J. held that because the OMDC was able to ascertain a reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1), the presumption has no application in this case and should not be applied in favour of Pong Marketing. In her dissent, Sachs J. writes:
<QUOTE><P><CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours</SOC><CITE>1994 CanLII 58</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 3</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>171 N.R. 161</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> and the cases that have followed it have made it clear that the presumption at issue now has a very limited role to play in the interpretation of tax legislation. It is a residual presumption that should only be resorted to if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation by applying Driedger's modem approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, the OMDC was able to resolve the meaning of the legislation in question without resort to the residual presumption. A reasonableness review requires that the OMDC's decision in this regard be respected unless it falls outside the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Divisional Court Decision, OMDC AB &amp; C, Tab 3, p. 27, para. 88</P1></P>
<P>82. As noted above, the majority erroneously stated that the residual presumption would apply in Pong Marketing's favour if the OMDC's interpretation of the Regulation were found to be reasonable. This statement conflicts with the scope of the reviewing court's authority on a reasonableness standard of review and does not give rise to the exceptional circumstances necessary to apply the residual presumption.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDENT IN APPEAL, PONG MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS INC.</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW&mdash;NATURE OF CASE AND ISSUES</TI>
<P>1. In its factum, the Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;the Appellant&rdquo; or &ldquo;the OMDC&rdquo;) seeks to complicate a very simple case. The majority in the Divisional Court applied the appropriate standard of review: reasonableness. And it reached the appropriate result: the OMDC's interpretation of the relevant provision is unreasonable. That should be the beginning and end of the matter.</P>
<P>2. Instead, the OMDC tries to circumvent the Divisional Court's unassailable reasoning in two respects. First, the ODMC contends that, although the majority was unequivocal that it had reviewed the OMDCs decision on the basis of reasonableness, in actuality the Divisional Court applied a correctness standard. In so doing, the OMDC effectively invents a ground of appeal out of whole cloth. The OMDC's real complaint is not that the Divisional Court failed to accord it deference. The OMDC's problem is that the Divisional Court did not apply the reasonableness standard as though it were a rubber stamp. That is not a legal error.</P>
<P>3. Second, the OMDC contends that the majority in the Divisional Court misapplied the residual presumption which favours the taxpayer in the interpretation of a tax benefit. But Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O. was abundantly clear that he <EM>did not apply the residual presumption at all</EM>. In fact, his exact words were: <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;I do not find it necessary to resort to this principle to resolve this application because I do not think the respondent's interpretation is a reasonable one.&rdquo;</EM></BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Judgment of the Divisional Court dated January 25, 2017 [&ldquo;Divisional Court's Reasons&rdquo;], at para. 43 [Appeal Book and Compendium (&ldquo;AB&amp;C&rdquo;), at Tab 3, pp. 18-19]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> One can't misapply what one hasn't applied in the first place. Even if the residual presumption were engaged, the approach now attacked would have been correct. Reasonableness and deference are not intended to insulate an administrative decision-maker from the principles of interpretation that govern every other tribunal or court.</P>
<P>4. Accordingly, and pursuant to the below, the Respondent requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>5. The Respondent accepts the Appellant's summary of the facts as substantially correct and relies on the following additional facts.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Pong's Business Model</EM></TI>
<P>6. Pong Game Studios Corporation (previously Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.) (&ldquo;Pong&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Respondent&rdquo;) is a digital studio based in Woodbridge, Ontario that designs interactive digital games. The Respondent's library of games includes the fifteen &ldquo;sweepstakes&rdquo; games at issue here (&ldquo;the Gaming Products&rdquo;). These games resemble slot-machine type games in which the player typically has a number of spins. The Gaming Products have creative designs and unique themes that make them fun for the user.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Descriptions of the Gaming Products, including pictures, may be found in the OMDC's Exhibit Book [&ldquo;OMDC's EB&rdquo;], at Tab 3, pp. 63&ndash;515</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Pong obtains revenue from the Gaming Products by licensing them to third parties, such as telecommunication companies. These third parties use the Gaming Products to promote their own products. Because Pong's games are entertaining for the user to play, they are conducive to providing this promotional opportunity. That is always going to be the case with digital games. As the producers of The Price is Right (or any other game show) would attest, games that are entertaining tend to serve as a good vehicle for promotion.</P>
<P>8. All of Pong's revenue, however, is derived from having users play and enjoy the game. Entertainment is therefore Pong's focus; promotion potential is secondary and completely under the control of the third-party licensee.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Digital Media Tax Credit</EM></TI>
<P>9. The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;Digital Media Tax Credit&rdquo;) was introduced in 1998. The Digital Media Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit for up to 40% of eligible Ontario labour, marketing, and distribution expenditures incurred through the development of interactive digital media products that educate, inform, or entertain the user.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, S.O. 2007 c. 11 Sched. A [&ldquo;<EM>Taxation Act</EM>&rdquo;], s. 93(2.1) and s. 93(14); O. Reg. 37/09 [&ldquo;the Regulations&rdquo;], s. 34(1). As the OMDC notes in its factum (see at p. 4, n.3), effective March 2017 the legislature has amended s. 34(1) of the Regulations in order to restrict eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit. Prior to the amendment, an &ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; was defined as a product whose primary purpose was to &ldquo;educate, inform, or entertain the user.&rdquo; The definition has changed so that &ldquo;interactive digital media products&rdquo; are now those that &ldquo;entertain the user or ... educate users who are under 12 years of age.&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Digital Media Tax Credit was designed to create &ldquo;good-paying jobs in the high-tech industries&rdquo; such as interactive digital media.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, legislative Assembly, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 36th Parl, 2nd Sess, No L064B (3 Dec 1998) at 2020 (Bert Johnson) [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 1, p. 2]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The aim behind the Digital Media Tax Credit was thus to &ldquo;help businesses in these industries grow and contribute to the development of long-term, internationally viable Ontario industries with jobs for the future.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 36th Parl, 2nd Sess, No L064B (3 Dec 1998) at 2120 (Bert Johnson) [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 1, p. 23]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Digital Media Tax Credit was expanded in 2006, 2008, and 2009 with the aim to &ldquo;encourage individuals to invest&rdquo; in the area of digital media.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 38th Parl, 2nd Sess, No L116A (31 Oct 2006) at 1630 (Hon Michael A Brown) [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 2, p. 27]. See also Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 12 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 13]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong is one such enterprise.</P>
<P>10. Pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Regulations, a &ldquo;non-specified&rdquo; product may be eligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit if it is &ldquo;an interactive digital media product&rdquo; and the product is not captured by one of the listed exceptions in s. 34(3). Subsection 34(3) In relevant part provides:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(3)</N><SSECP>A product... is an eligible product for [a credit] if the following conditions are satisfied:
<PARA><N>1.</N><PARAP>The product is an interactive digital media product. ...</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>5.</N><PARAP>The product is not used <UNDER>primarily to present or promote</UNDER> <UNDER>the qualifying corporation</UNDER> or a qualifying predecessor corporation.</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>6.</N><PARAP>The product is not used <UNDER>primarily to present, promote or sell the products or services of the qualifying corporation</UNDER> or of a qualifying predecessor corporation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Emphasis added. Note s. 34(3) has also been amended as of March 2017, but the quoted portions are unchanged.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>11. Accordingly, an interactive digital media product will not be eligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit if its primary use is to promote <EM>the applicant</EM> or <EM>the applicant's products</EM>. That is not the same as a product purchased or leased by a third party. The provision contains no reference to the promotion of a third party's products.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The OMDC's Guidelines and the evolution of the Digital Media Tax Credit</EM></TI>
<P>12. The OMDC has published Guidelines related to the Digital Media Tax Credit which explain, among other things, how eligibility for the credit is determined.</P>
<P>13. The Guidelines as they existed at the time of Pong's application clearly indicated that the Gaming Products would be eligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit. Quoting from the Regulations, the Guidelines stated that an interactive digital media product would qualify provided that it did not promote the applicant's own products.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit Guidelines (updated June 2011) [&ldquo;the Guidelines&rdquo;], at pp. 6, 13&ndash;19 [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 3, pp. 36, 43&ndash;49]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. The OMDC updated the Guidelines in or around June 2015 in light of proposed amendments to the Regulations (which ultimately went into effect in March 2017). The amended Guidelines provided additional clarity to the eligibility requirements. The amended Guidelines explained that products would be considered primarily promotional and ineligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit <EM>unless they had a &ldquo;revenue generating stream&rdquo;</EM>. According to the OMDC, revenue generating streams include:
<ITEM><P>The sale of the product;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD>Fees for use of the product, including licence and subscription fees; In-product purchases (also called an in-game or in-app purchase, which occurs when the user can purchase an enhancement to the product);</BOLD></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD>Third party advertising within the product (marketing and promotion of a corporation or person, or products or services of a corporation or person, that is not related to the product developer or the purchaser corporation in the case of a specified product);</BOLD> and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The sale or licence of another product developed by your company that can reasonably be considered an extension or upgrade of the product.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit Guidelines (updated June 2015) [&ldquo;the amended Guidelines&rdquo;], at p. 14 (emphasis added) [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 4, p. 114]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Application of the Digital Media Tax Credit to other digital media companies</EM></TI>
<P>15. In light of these Guidelines, the OMDC has granted entitlement to the Digital Media Tax Credit to companies that, like Pong, produce digital games that promote the products of third-party licensees. Fuel Industries (&ldquo;Fuel&rdquo;) is one example. Fuel has benefitted from at least $3 million in credits from the OMDC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 41st Parl, 1st Sess, F-9 (22 January 2015) (Hon Sue Wong) at F-144. (See generally F-142-44) [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 5, p. 178 (see generally pp. 176&ndash;178)]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to its website, Fuel &ldquo;helps Fortune 500 global brands connect with GenZ, Millennial and Family audiences using deep, digital brand experiences that include immersive virtual worlds, mobile apps and social gaming, branded entertainment, interactive multi-screen experiences, interactive rich media advertising, and digital loyalty programs.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;About&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/about</UNDER> [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 6A, p. 221]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Fuel's games include such offerings as <EM>NASCAR: Acceleration Nation, Disney Junior Magic Phone, DreamWorks DreamPlace: Naughty or Nice</EM>, and <EM>McDonald's: Cut the Rope</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/work</UNDER> [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 6B, pp. 226&ndash;231] &tilde;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Fuel boasts that one of its games, available through McDonald's &ldquo;Magic Camera&rdquo; application, &ldquo;led to a 500% increase of the Magic Camera app downloads vs the previous month.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;How to Train Your Dragon 2&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/projects/how-to-train-your-dragon-2/</UNDER> [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 6C, p. 233]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Fuel was undoubtedly awarded eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit because its games are designed for entertainment and its products have an independent revenue generating stream. In addition, the (extensive) promotional content in Fuel's games is not aimed at promoting Fuel's <EM>own</EM> products, but rather the products of third parties. Fuel, like Pong, is therefore not excluded by any of the listed exceptions in s. 34(3).</P>
<P>17. Nor is Fuel the only similarly-situated company that the OMDC has deemed eligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Ontario, Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 41st Parl, 1st Sess, F-11 (27 January 2015) (Hon Sue Wong) at F-236-37. BattleGoat Studios and SHGStudios (f/k/a Snakehead Games) are also listed as recipients of the Digital Media Tax Credit. [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 7, pp. 251-252]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Pong's Application for the Digital Media Tax Credit</EM></TI>
<P>18. Pong applied for the Digital Media Tax Credit for the Gaming Products on April 16, 2014. Pong sought a tax credit of approximately $2 million. The claimed amount represented the work of over 60 Pong game developers, testers, mathematicians, and designers, constituting 90% of Pong's employees at the time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 4 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 12]; see also Letter from T. Gioia to K. Thorne-Stone dated Nov. 3, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 14, p. 725]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Pong expended significant resources developing the Gaming Products on the perfectly reasonable expectation that it was entitled to the Digital Media Tax Credit according to the plain language of the relevant provision and the OMDC's Guidelines. Pong was anxious to receive these funds in order to reinvest in its business and employ additional people at its Wood bridge facility.</P>
<P>20. Pong did not receive an answer from the OMDC until more than <EM>15 months</EM> after Pong submitted its application. In the meantime, it continued to support high-tech jobs in its facility. On July 29, 2015, Michael Olivier, the Business Officer assigned to the file, informed Pong's CEO William Dawson of the OMDC's position that &ldquo;all of the[] games are primarily promotional, as they were developed expressly as sweepstakes promotions for long distance phone cards.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through the OMDC Online Application Portal (&ldquo;OAP&rdquo;) between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated July 29, 2015. [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 711] (Pursuant to OMDC policy, much of the correspondence between Pong and the OMDC took place through the OAP.)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Mr. Oliver stated that the OMDC's position was based on two things. First, Mr. Olivier cited Pong's statements on its website that Pong's products were designed to help telecommunication companies compete &ldquo;against the industry's] top competitors in the phone card market&rdquo; and &ldquo;create consumer involvement with a brand or product and thus encourage consumption of that product.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated July 29, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 711]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, Mr. Olivier claimed that Pong's template licensing agreement &ldquo;confirmed] the promotional nature of the submitted sweepstakes games&rdquo; because, for example, the licensing agreement stated that Pong's games could be used as a &ldquo;means of promotion to aid in the sale of long distance calling cards and other related products or services.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W, Dawson and M. Olivier dated July 29, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 712]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. Pong was surprised and disappointed by the OMDC's position. On September 8, 2015, Mr. Dawson submitted a further correspondence to the OMDC in which he attempted to explain that the OMDC had conflated the products' purpose with Pong's business model. Mr. Dawson agreed that one of Pong's revenue models was to licence its games &ldquo;to the game promotion/sweepstakes market.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated September 8, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 4A, p. 516]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, &ldquo;[i]n this licensed revenue stream, <EM>a game player's sole interest is to be entertained by the games played</EM> with a prospect of winning a prize.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated September 8, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 4A, p. 516] (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mr. Dawson pointed out that &ldquo;[t]he recent budget amendments <EM>require</EM> a revenue generating stream in an attempt to eliminate promotional products from&rdquo; eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated September 8, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 4A, p. 517] (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As Mr. Dawson added, &ldquo;Pong's products clearly meet this definition as they have always been for sale via the license agreement&rdquo; and they are &ldquo;not used primarily to present, promote or sell the products or services of the qualifying corporation or of a qualifying predecessor corporation.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated September 8, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 4A, p. 517]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mr. Dawson stated that he was available for further discussion or clarification and suggested a site visit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through GAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated Sept. 8, 2015, 3:57pm [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 719]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. Less than two hours later, Mr. Olivier responded that &ldquo;I don't read anything in your Business Model clarification document that changes our primary purpose determination&rdquo; and a &ldquo;face to face meeting is not warranted at this time.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between M. Olivier and W. Dawson dated Sept. 8, 2015, 5:52pm [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 719]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Mr. Dawson provided additional documentation on September 24, 2015 consisting of screen captures from Pong's website, game revenue by title from April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2015, pictures of internet cafe game rooms, marketing materials, and game videos.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated Sept. 24, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, pp. 718-19]; see also Additional Documents Provided by Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. on September 24, 2015. [OMDC's EB, at Tab 5, pp. 518&ndash;697]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Mr. Olivier responded on October 23, 2015 that he had reviewed the games and the additional documentation and had not changed his mind. Among other things, Mr. Olivier stated that he had noticed that the games contained in-game promotional content for phone cards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between M. Olivier and W. Dawson of October 23, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, pp. 714-18]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. Pong followed up with a letter through counsel on November 3, 2015. The letter again emphasized that &ldquo;the primary purpose of {the Gaming Products] is to entertain the user&rdquo; and that each of the Gaming Products &ldquo;contains an individual revenue generating stream&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from T. Gioia to K. Thorne-Stone dated November 3, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 14, pp. 725-26]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. Jennifer Blitz, the OMDC's Director of Tax Credits and Financing Programs, responded on behalf of the OMDC on November 30, 2015. Ms. Blitz confirmed the OMDC's position that the Gaming Products were ineligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit because they promoted the products of third-party licensees. Ms. Blitz again referred to Pong's licensing agreement and website. She also cited the in-game promotional content.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from J. Blitz to W. Dawson dated November 30, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 15, pp. 727-32]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. On December 11, 2015, almost <EM>twenty months</EM> after Pong submitted its application, the OMDC issued a Letter of Ineligibility for the Gaming Products. The letter stated, in conclusory terms, that the products did not satisfy s. 34(f) of the Regulations because their primary purpose was not to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;to promote the sale of phonecards and other related products and services.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from J. Blitz to W. Dawson dated December 11, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 19, p. 755]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;POSITION ON ISSUES</TI>
<P>29. The Appellant proposes four issues.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's Factum, at para. 40</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Properly understood, this appeal presents the following questions:
<P1>(a) Was the OMDC's interpretation of the relevant provision unreasonable?</P1>
<P1>(b) Did the Divisional Court apply the appropriate standard of review?</P1>
<P1>(c) Does the residual presumption apply in this case?</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The OMDC's Interpretation of s. 34(1) is Unreasonable</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The OMDC's application of the Digital Media Tax Credit conflicts with the plain language and purpose of the relevant provision</EM></TI>
<P>30. The Appellant argues that the Divisional Court's interpretation of s. 34(1) &ldquo;is too narrow and reads in limitations to the scope of the provision that undermine the legislative intent.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Appellant's Factum at paras. 6, 65</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With respect, this is the pot calling the kettle black. The Divisional Court's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulations is the only reasonable interpretation available in light of the plain language of the provision and the object and purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit. In contrast, the OMDC's interpretation is ungrounded in the words of the Regulations and calculated to contrive an overly restrictive reading that clashes with the language of the provision and its legislative purpose.</P>
<P>31. The Divisional Court examined the plain language of s. 34(1), which defines an &ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; as:
<QUOTE><P>... <EM>a combination of</EM> one or more <EM>application files</EM> and one or more <EM>data files</EM>, all in a digital format, that are integrated and are intended to be operated together and <EM>that have the following characteristics when they are being operated</EM>:</P>
<P>1. <UNDER><EM>Their</EM></UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 26 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 16] (underlining added by Divisional Court; other emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>32. The Divisional Court pointed out that the &ldquo;their&rdquo; in s. 34(1) of the Regulations obviously refers to the &ldquo;application files&rdquo; or the &ldquo;data files&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 27 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 16]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Put simply, the provision indicates that a digital game will be an eligible interactive digital media product if the primary purpose of <BOLD><EM>the game, while It is being played</EM>,</BOLD> is to entertain <BOLD><EM>the user</EM>.</BOLD> No other reasonable reading of the Regulations is credibly available. Had the Regulation intended to focus on the developer, it could have, and would have, said so. It does not and the language used is unambiguous.</P>
<P>33. As the Divisional Court summarized:
<QUOTE><P>The definition focuses on the time when the application files and data files are operated together by the user and provides that one of their characteristics at that moment is that their primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user. The only time the user operates those files is when he or she is playing a Sweepstakes game. The primary purpose of the applicant when creating or licensing the product is a different inquiry.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 33 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 17]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. In addition to emphasizing the unambiguous language of the provision, the Divisional Court explained why the OMDC's interpretation clashes with the object and purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 35 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 17]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. As set out above, the OMDC felt that the primary purpose of the Gaming Products was not to entertain the user because the games were designed to, among other things, &ldquo;help licensees or retailers compete against top competitors in the phone card market&rdquo; and &ldquo;create consumer involvement with a brand or product to encourage consumption of that product.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 30 {AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 17] quoting Correspondence through OAP from M. Olivier to W. Dawson of July 29, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 711]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. That reading of the provision is simply unreasonable and ungrounded in the words. Whatever measure of deference one offers to the OMDC, at some point words have obvious meanings that must be respected.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Antosko</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 S.C.R. 312</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Pong's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;Pong's BOA&rdquo;), at Tab 1] (&ldquo;While it is true that the courts must view discrete sections of [taxation legislation] in light of the other provisions of the Act and of the purpose of the legislation ... such techniques cannot alter the result where the words of the statute are clear and plain and where the legal and practical effect of the transaction is undisputed&rdquo;.)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The OMDC's approach is unsustainable.</P>
<P>37. It flies in the face of the Digital Media Tax Credit's entire reason for existence: to create jobs in Ontario in the digital media industry.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 36 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 18]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong creates digital games that are entertaining. It employs dozens of people and expends significant resources in the development process. Pong's underlying motivation is, of course, to create profit by selling or licensing its games to third parties. That is the case with all for-profit entities.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 40 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 18]:
<QUOTE><P>The respondent submitted that the Ontario Media Development Corporation has a cultural aspect to it&mdash;a submission with which I agree. I recognize that the digital media tax credit is available to not-for-profit arts and cultural enterprises. I also recognize that those corporations do not have a profit motive. I do not believe this makes any difference to the proper interpretation of the regulation. The tax credit was introduced to benefit or assist the development of the interactive digital media industry. At the same time tax credits were introduced to benefit sound recording, computer animation and special effects companies and thereby create jobs in Ontario. The inclusion of not-for-profit arts and cultural enterprises was not accompanied by a corresponding restriction on the availability of this credit to for-profit corporations.</P></QUOTE></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong's games are attractive to third parties <BOLD><EM>because they entertain</EM></BOLD> and therefore offer an effective vehicle for the promotion of their products.</P>
<P>38. Furthermore, in licensing its games to third parties, Pong is also complying with a <EM>pre-requisite</EM> for eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit as set out in the OMDC's Guidelines&mdash;namely, that the product have a revenue generating stream. The Guidelines explicitly indicate that revenue generating streams may include licensing fees for use of the product and third party advertising within the product, which may come from promotion of the third party and/or the third party's products. In fact, without a revenue generating stream, the OMDC has indicated that it will consider the product to be primarily promotional. The OMDC cannot reasonably mandate that the product have a revenue generating stream and then punish the applicant for marketing its product in a way that derives revenue.</P>
<P>39. The OMDC's interpretation would create the perverse situation where digital gaming companies are forced to choose between licensing opportunities and eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit. That approach would actually <EM>discourage</EM> investment in the digital media field. Such an interpretation would defeat the purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit and is absurd. It is, therefore, unreasonable.</P>
<P>40. Indeed, as Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O. noted for the majority of the Divisional Court, it is nonsensical to cite the developer's profit-making motive as a reason for disqualifying it from the tax credit:
<QUOTE><P>A developer intending to license games will primarily want the games to promote the product of the licensee otherwise the licensee will not want the games. The respondent's reliance on this motivation or statements of it to conclude that the developer's product is primarily promotional and therefore not eligible for the tax credit means that the developer's fundamental purpose weighs negatively against eligibility for the tax credit, even though the legislature intended to use the tax credit to assist high-technology, knowledge-based industries.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 35 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 17]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>41. Thus, in denying Pong's application for the Digital Media Tax Credit, the OMDC conflated Pong's <EM>business model</EM> with its <EM>products' purpose</EM>. Pong develops its games to be entertaining to the user. Once developed, however, Pong must sell or license the games in order to derive revenue from them. Without revenue, it cannot create jobs.</P>
<P>42. The OMDC claims that the Divisional Court erred by focusing on the user's purpose for playing the games instead of the developer's purpose for developing the games. It says the user's purpose is less important because it &ldquo;will always be subjective&rdquo; and therefore difficult to pin down; the developer's purpose, in contrast, is discernable through, for example, the developer's promotional materials.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Appellant's Factum, at para. 60</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This does not make sense, and in any event does not come close to what the section actually says.</P>
<P>43. The user's purpose for playing Pong's digital games is not nebulous. It is obvious: users play the games to be entertained. Users do not play the games for their promotional content; the promotional content is placed in the game by a third party seeking to take advantage of the user's captivated attention.</P>
<P>44. Every developer's motivation is fixed: it is to derive revenue from the games. That is why the Regulations' language focuses on the user, not the developer. Focusing on the developer would mean that only not-for-profit product development would qualify for the credit. But that would render the Digital Media Tax Credit virtually unobtainable (because of the requirement of revenue).</P>
<P>45. The OMDC contends that under the Divisional Court's interpretation of the provision &ldquo;all interactive digital media products, and in particular all digital interactive games, regardless of their predominant purpose, would qualify.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's Factum, at para. 62</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This concern is without merit and easily dismissed. There is a litany of digital media products that would not be eligible for the tax credit because their primary purpose while being operated is not to &ldquo;educate, inform, or entertain&rdquo; the user. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Venngo inc. v. Ontario Media Development Corp.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Divisional Court upheld the OMDC's ruling that a coupon website did not qualify for the Digital Media Tax Credit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>[2013] O.J. No. 961 (Div. Ct) [OMDC's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;OMDC's BOA&rdquo;), at Tab 5]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nor would every digital game qualify. The legislature has placed express limits on eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit by, for example, excluding products that promote the applicant's <EM>own</EM> products or services.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See s. 34(3) of the Regulations, <EM>supra</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> And, most significantly, as the Divisional Court pointed out, <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;[i]f the [OMDC] thinks that the regulation, properly interpreted, is not achieving the intended objective or is overly generous, then it is open to the Government to amend the regulation</EM>.&rdquo;</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 39 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 18] (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. The government has, in fact, recently amended the Regulations and narrowed eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit. That is within its prerogative. It is <EM>not</EM>, however, open to the Appellant to ask the Court to retroactively read in limitations that did not exist at the relevant time.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>In-game promotional content is Irrelevant</EM></TI>
<P>47. Although nearly all of the OMDC's arguments are rehashed from its position in the court below, the OMDC has inserted a new argument in an attempt to fit itself within the Divisional Court's reasoning. At paragraphs 66 to 69 of its factum, the OMDC notes that the majority of the Divisional Court concluded that it was an error for the OMDC to focus its inquiry on the motivation of the game's developer rather than its user. The OMDC then asserts that it actually <EM>did</EM> focus on the user (at least in part) because, in concluding that the Gaming Products were primarily promotional, one of the things cited by the OMDC was promotional content that pops up when the Gaming Products are being played.</P>
<P>48. This argument completely misses the point of the Divisional Court's ruling (indeed, it reveals a flawed misunderstanding of what is at issue on this appeal). It is of course not in dispute that the Gaming Products have embedded promotional content that reaches the user during game play. If the promotional content contained in the Gaming Products didn't actually reach the user, the games wouldn't be very effective vehicles of promotion. Nor is it in dispute that the OMDC considered this promotional content.</P>
<P>49. But this assertion has no bearing on the central question here: whether it was unreasonable for the OMDC to disqualify Pong from receiving the Digital Medial Tax Credit solely because the Gaming Products are promotional, and despite the fact that the user obviously plays the game to be entertained. For the reasons submitted above, it was.</P>
<P>50. The OMDC's argument also contradicts its Guidelines. As noted above, examples of revenue generating streams, <EM>which are mandated by the OMDC</EM>, include <EM>&ldquo;[t]hird party advertising within the product&rdquo;</EM> and <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;in-game purchases&rdquo;</EM>.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended Guidelines, at p. 14 [Pong's Compendium, at Tab 4, p. 114] (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The OMDC cannot run from its own Guidelines.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>The Divisional Court Applied the Appropriate Standard of Review</TI>
<P>51. The Appellant argues that &ldquo;the majority effectively applied a standard of correctness and failed to grant the OMDC's decision the deference to which it is entitled.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, at para 42</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This contention is groundless.</P>
<P>52. It is odd that Pong, the applicant in this matter, is put in the position of asserting that a reasonableness standard of review is appropriate here. In any event, Pong agrees that it is, and the Divisional Court rightly concluded as such. Quoting from <EM>Venngo</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, the Court found that the interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulations is &ldquo;a question that concerns OMDC's interpretation of its home legislation and is exactly the type of issue that falls within the OMDC's specialized expertise. The question ... lies at the core of the OMDC's function.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's reasons at para. 24 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, pp. 15-16], quoting <EM>Venngo</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. The problem with the OMDC's position is not that the Divisional Court failed to grant it deference. The problem with the OMDC's position is that its reading of s. 34(1) is unreasonable. Deference does not mean a body like the OMDC is a law unto itself. It remains subject to review. In approaching the OMDC's decision the Divisional Court cited <CASEREF><SOC>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</SOC></CASEREF>, which states that &ldquo;an unreasonable decision [i]s one that did not stand up to a somewhat probing analysis.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2003 SCC 20, at para. 25 (see also at para. 47) [OMDC's BOA, at Tab 8], cited in Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 25 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 16]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court conducted such an analysis and rightly concluded that the OMDC's decision could not withstand somewhat probing scrutiny.</P>
<P>54. A reasonableness standard accords deference to an administrative body's decisions where the application of the usual rules of statutory interpretation leave some ambiguity. It is important not to allow &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; to effectively <EM>immunize</EM> all decisions made by that administrative body. Here, the Divisional Court applied the correct standard of review and found that the OMDC's application of the Regulations in these circumstances was unreasonable. There is no basis to interfere with that finding.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Even if the OMDC's Interpretation Was Reasonable, the Residual Assumption Applies</TI>
<P>55. The Appellant argues that the majority of the Divisional Court &ldquo;misapplied the residual presumption to the circumstances of this case.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants Factum, at para. 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This assertion is also baseless.</P>
<P>56. Reasonableness and deference are engaged when, after the application of all relevant principles of statutory interpretation, ambiguity remains. As Moldaver J. said for the court in <CASEREF><SOC>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>It will not always be the case that a particular provision permits multiple reasonable interpretations. Where the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation lead to a single reasonable interpretation and the administrative decision maker adopts a different interpretation, its interpretation will necessarily be unreasonable&mdash;no degree of deference can justify its acceptance... In those cases, the &ldquo;range of reasonable outcomes&rdquo; <CASEREF><SOC>(Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa</SOC></CASEREF>, [...]) will necessarily be limited to a single reasonable interpretation&mdash;and the administrative decision maker must adopt it. [citations omitted].<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] S.C.J. No. 67</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Pong's BOA, at Tab 2]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>57. The residual presumption is an applicable principle that requires that &ldquo;a reasonable doubt, not resolved by the ordinary rules of interpretation,&rdquo; regarding the applicability of a tax credit &ldquo;will be settled by recourse to [a] residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. para. 43, quoting <CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours</SOC><CITE>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 3</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [OMDC's BOA, at Tab 17]; see also <CASEREF><SOC>Valente v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2006] T.C.J. No. 92</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Pong's BOAr at Tab 3]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. As a preliminary matter, the Divisional Court did not <EM>apply</EM> the residual presumption. It therefore could not have misapplied it. The majority's reasons were very clear that it was <EM>not</EM> resorting to the residual presumption, due to its conclusion that the OMDC's decision was unreasonable. Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O. was unambiguous on this point; as he wrote: &ldquo;I do not find it necessary to resort to this principle to resolve this application because I do not think the respondent's interpretation is a reasonable one.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons at para. 43 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, pp. 18-19]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. In any event, the parties are essentially <EM>ad idem</EM> on the applicability of the residual presumption. The OMDC writes that &ldquo;[w]hen there are two interpretations and one cannot be said to be the more reasonable than the other, <EM>the choice should then be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.&rdquo;</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's Factum, at para. 73 (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong agrees with this statement and so would Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O.</P>
<P>60. The OMDC's position <EM>at its highest</EM> is that Its interpretation is <EM>equally</EM> reasonable. Surely, in light of the plain wording of s. 34(1), it cannot be said that the OMDC's reading is <EM>more</EM> reasonable than Pong's. Accordingly, the OMDC apparently concedes that the residual presumption should apply here.</P>
<P>61. Despite this apparent admission, the OMDC proceeds to argue that the residual presumption should not apply because &ldquo;[i]f the OMDC's decision is reasonable, then by definition there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the legislation requiring resort to the residual presumption; it is necessarily implied that no unresolvable dispute exists regarding the meaning of the provision.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's Factum at para. 81</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. This reasoning is tautological and unhelpful (it also contradicts the OMDC's earlier concession that the residual presumption should apply where there are two equally reasonable interpretations). The OMDC's claim is essentially that we know the residual presumption does not apply because the OMDC didn't apply it. In the court below, Justice Sachs said essentially the same thing:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 88 [AB&amp;C, at Tab 3, p. 27] (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P><CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours</SOC><CITE>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 3</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>171 N.R. 161</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> and the cases that have followed it have made it clear that the presumption at issue now has a very limited role to play in the interpretation of tax legislation, it is a residual presumption that should only be resorted to if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation by applying. Driedger's modern approach to statutory interpretation. <UNDER>In this case, the OMDC was able to resolve the meaning of the legislation in question without resort to the residual presumption</UNDER>. A reasonableness review requires that the OMDC's decision in this regard be respected unless it falls outside the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>63. With great respect for Justice Sachs, this logic cannot be right. In all cases, the administrative body will reach a decision. The mere fact that the decision maker reached a decision tells you nothing in and of itself about the reasonableness of that decision. Moreover, if Justice Sachs is correct that the residual presumption does not apply here because the OMDC &ldquo;resolv[ed] the meaning of the legislation in question&rdquo; without applying it, then the residual presumption would apply only at the whim of the administrative body. That is nonsensical and risks eliminating the residual presumption entirely.</P>
<P>64. Furthermore, there are important policy reasons for why the residual presumption is warranted in precisely this type of case.</P>
<P>65. As seen above in the discussion regarding similarly-situated companies like Fuel, the OMDC has granted the Digital Medial Tax Credit to companies whose business models are virtually indistinguishable from Fong's. Indeed, there is no appreciable difference between Pong's desire to &ldquo;create consumer involvement with a brand or product and thus encourage consumption of that product&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated July 29, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 711]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and Fuel's goal of &ldquo;help[ing] Fortune 500 global brands connect with GenZ, Millennial and Family audiences using deep, digital brand experiences&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through OAP between W. Dawson and M. Olivier dated July 29, 2015 [OMDC's EB, at Tab 9, p. 711]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Moreover, Fuel's games are chock-full of in-game promotional content aimed at the user.</P>
<P>66. It is a fundamental principle of the interpretation of taxation statutes that like taxpayers should be treated alike.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g., <CASEREF><SOC>Jonas v. Gilbert</SOC><CITE>[1881] S.C.J. No. 5</CITE><PAGENUM>at pp. 6 and 7</PAGENUM></CASEREF> [Pong's BOA, Tab 4]; <CASEREF><SOC>65302 British Columbia Ltd. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[1999] 3 S.C.R. 804</CITE><PARANUM>60</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Pong's BOA, at Tab 5]; <CASEREF><SOC>McNeil v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2000] 4 F.C. 132</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 14 [Pong's BOA, at Tab 6]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is unfair and irrational to apply a tax benefit in two different ways to identical companies, even if it could be said that both interpretations of the relevant provision are reasonable. This creates an uneven playing field.</P>
<P>67. It also a fundamental principle of the interpretation of taxation statutes that taxes should be applied in a predictable manner. As explained by the Federal Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Gunn v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[S]tatutory interpretation must be informed by the recognition that, in a self-assessing tax system that respects the right of taxpayers to plan their tax affairs intelligently, taxpayers require rules that are consistent, predictable and fair. These objectives are undermined by provisions that are so vague that their application cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. <UNDER>They may be further undermined if they are applied on the basis of a judge-made rule that has no statutory foundation</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gunn v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2007] 3 F.C.R. 57</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 78 [Pong's BOA, Tab 7], citing <CASEREF><SOC>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2005] 2 S.C.R. 601</CITE></CASEREF> [Pong's BOA, Tab 8] (emphasis added and Internal citation omitted)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Certainty is particularly vital in this context because companies like Pong must decide <EM>before</EM> they manufacture their products what their expenses will be. Recall that the Digital Media Tax Credit represents up to <BOLD><EM>40%</EM></BOLD> of a company's labour, marketing, and distribution costs. Needless to say, this is a significant portion of a company's balance sheet.</P>
<P>68. Without consistency and predictability the Digital Media Tax Credit cannot fulfill its purpose: to encourage investment in Ontario's digital media industry. Uncertainty and unpredictability frustrates investment. Companies like Pong must be made to feel secure that if they comply with the plain language of eligibility for the credit they will be entitled to it. Otherwise, they will not take the risk of spending millions of dollars that they may never get back (or borrowing millions of dollars they may never be able to repay). In addition, companies will not hire additional employees if they are uncertain as to whether they will have the resources to pay for them.</P>
<P>69. Accordingly although the question of the applicability of the residual presumption in this case is a purely academic one, it is clear that the residual presumption exists for this <EM>precise</EM> set of circumstances and should apply.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF MOTION</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE MOVING PARTY,</BOLD> the Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;OMDC&rdquo;), will make a motion to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Divisional Court, <EM>per</EM> Associate Chief Justice Marrocco, and Justices Nordheimer and Sachs, made January 25, 2017.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE COURT WILL HEAR THE MOTION IN WRITING,</BOLD> 36 days after service of the Moving Party's Motion Record, Factum and transcripts, if any, or on the filing of the Moving Party's Reply Factum, if any, whichever is earlier.</P>
<P>The motion will be heard at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:</BOLD> The motion is to be heard in writing.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. An order granting leave to appeal from the Judgment;</P>
<P>2. The costs of this motion; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit</EM></TI>
<P>1. The OMDC is an agency of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. It was established to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer tax credit programs in furtherance of that objective.</P>
<P>2. The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;OIDMTC&rdquo;) is a refundable tax credit for the development of eligible interactive digital media products in Ontario. If a product is eligible for the OIDMTC, the applicant corporation may claim a percentage of Ontario labour expenditures, and certain marketing and distribution expenditures incurred during the product's development.</P>
<P>3. Pursuant to section 93 of the <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, the OMDC is responsible for determining whether a corporation is eligible for the OIDMTC, and whether a product is an eligible product for the OIDMTC.</P>
<P>4. Section 34(1) of O Reg 37/09, made under the <EM>Taxation Act 2007</EM>, specifies that an eligible product must be an &ldquo;interactive digital media product.&rdquo; Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an interactive digital media product, the primary purpose of the product must be to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; Products that are determined by the OMDC to be primarily promotional in nature do not qualify for the tax credit.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Pong Marketing and Development Inc.'s Application for the OIDMTC</EM></TI>
<P>5. In April 2014, Pong Marketing and Development Inc. applied for the OIDMTC with respect to 15 casino-style sweepstakes game products. These products were developed to be licenced to third party retailers, as part of a promotional program. Following its review of the products and information provided by Pong Marketing, the OMDC determined that the 15 products did not satisfy the eligibility requirements set out in section 34(1), because their primary purpose was not to educate, inform, or entertain the user. Rather, the OMDC determined that the primary purpose of the products was to promote the sale of phone cards and other related products and services.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Judicial Review of the OMDC Decision</EM></TI>
<P>6. Pong Marketing sought judicial review of the OMDC decision that the 15 products were ineligible. Pong Marketing argued that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) was unreasonable, and that the OMDC had failed to provide sufficient reasons for the decision.</P>
<P>7. The Divisional Court released a split decision on January 25, 2017, granting the application.</P>
<P>8. In its decision, the majority allowed the application, finding that the OMDC's interpretation of section 34(1) was unreasonable, holding that the only reasonable interpretation of section 34(1) &ldquo;requires the OMDC to look at the primary purpose of the game from the perspective of the player.&rdquo; The majority concluded that the OMDC had unreasonably considered the purpose for which the product was developed, which it held was an irrelevant consideration.</P>
<P>9. In addition, the majority held that even if the OMDC interpretation of section 34(1) was reasonable, a residual presumption that operates in favour of the taxpayer should be applied in the interpretation of taxation statutes. The majority held that this presumption should have been applied by the OMDC in this case.</P>
<P>10. Finally, the majority rejected Pong Marketing's argument that the reasons provided by the OMDC were insufficient.</P>
<P>11. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the application on the basis that deference should be afforded to the OMDC in its interpretation of the eligibility criteria under section 34(1). The dissent concluded that it was reasonable for the OMDC to consider the intended purpose of the product at the time of its creation when attempting to determine the primary purpose of the product while being operated. Accordingly, the OMDC's determination that the primary purpose of the games was to promote the sale of phone cards based on, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the purpose for which the products was developed, was entitled to deference.</P>
<P>12. Further, the dissenting judge noted that the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer has a limited purpose, and is only applied if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation using the modern approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, the residual presumption has no application as the OMDC was able to resolve the issue without needing to resort to the residual presumption.</P>
<P>13. The dissenting judge agreed with the majority that the OMDC's reasons were sufficient.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Appeal Has Merit and Bakes Issues of Public Importance</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. The OMDC has strong grounds for appeal on the following issues:
<P1>a. The majority erred in failing to give any deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and as such erroneously applied a standard of correctness;</P1>
<P1>b. The majority erred in holding that it was unreasonable for the OMDC to consider the purpose for which the products were developed when assessing whether the products' predominant purpose was promotional:</P1>
<P1>c. The majority erred in failing to give weight to the evidence showing that the OMDC did consider the promotional content of the products presented to users while in operation;</P1>
<P1>d. The majority erred in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case, and that it would favour the respondent; and</P1>
<P1>e. The dissenting decision showed the appropriate deference to the OMDC's expertise and properly found that the OMDC's statutory interpretation and findings were reasonable.</P1></P>
<P>15. The appeal raises issues of public importance. The matters at issue on this appeal concern the interpretation of a statute and regulation of general application. The appeal also raises questions concerning the broader principles applicable to the interpretation of taxation statutes by administrative decision makers.</P>
<P>16. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION</BOLD> is section 6(1)(a) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> and rule 61.03.1 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the motion:</P>
<P>1. The Record of Proceedings in the Court below; and</P>
<P>2. Such further evidence as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDENT/MOVING PARTY, ONTARIO MEDIA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;OMDC&rdquo;) seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court, dated February 25, 2017. The Divisional Court granted the Respondent Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.'s (&ldquo;Pong Marketing&rdquo;) application for judicial review of the OMDC's decision that 15 &ldquo;casino-style&rdquo; sweepstakes games are ineligible for the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;OIDMTC&rdquo;). Pong Marketing's OIDMTC application was remitted back to the OMDC for reconsideration.</P>
<P>2. The central issue on the proposed appeal is the interpretation of taxation legislation governing tax credits available to the rapidly evolving interactive digital media industry. If granted, this appeal engages significant issues of public importance, including the interpretation of a statute and regulation of general application, and broader questions concerning the principles applicable to the interpretation of taxation statutes by administrative decision makers.</P>
<P>3. The OMDC is an agency of Ontario's Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, that was established to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer the OIDMTC in furtherance of that objective. To be eligible for the OIDMTC, a product's primary purpose must be to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; Products that are primarily promotional do not meet the primary purpose test.</P>
<P>4. On its review of Pong Marketing's application, the OMDC found that the primary purpose of Pong Marketing's products is to promote the sale of long-distance calling cards, not to educate, inform or entertain the user. The OMDC's decision was based on a review of the 15 sweepstakes games themselves, as well as the materials submitted by Pong Marketing, including its template licensing agreements and website. In a split decision, the majority of the Divisional Court held that the OMDC's interpretation of O Reg 37/09 (the &ldquo;<EM>Regulation</EM>&rdquo;) under the <EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, S.O. 2007 c. 11 Sched A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;), was unreasonable because it considered the intended purpose of the product when it was being developed. Instead, the majority found that the only reasonable interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> requires the purpose of the sweepstakes games to be assessed exclusively from the perspective of the user during gameplay. The majority further held that even if the OMDC's decision was reasonable, the residual presumption applicable to tax legislation would require resolving any ambiguity in the interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> in favour of the taxpayer.</P>
<P>5. The OMDC submits that the majority made significant errors of law in its decision. In particular, and as noted by the dissenting judge, the majority erred by:
<P1>(a) Misinterpreting s. 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM>. The majority's interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> is too narrow and reads in limitations to the scope of the provision that undermine the legislative intent;</P1>
<P1>(b) Failing to grant deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and in doing so, erroneously applying a standard of correctness. It was reasonable for the ODMC to consider, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the intended purpose of the product at the time of its creation when assessing the primary purpose of the product. The ODMC's decision in this regard is entitled to deference; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Misapplying the residual presumption to the circumstances of this case. As noted by the dissenting judge, the residual presumption has a &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; role to play in the interpretation of tax legislation and should not apply in a case such as this one where the OMDC's interpretation is reasonable and is supported by the intent and wording of the legislative and regulatory scheme.</P1></P>
<P>6. It is both desirable and in the public interest for leave to be granted. The <EM>Act</EM> is a statute of general application and the interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> is an issue that extends beyond the interests of the immediate parties. The proper administration of tax credits in the cultural media sector affects thousands of individuals employed in the industry, and has a significant impact on a major source of revenue for the province.</P>
<P>7. Moreover, determining the appropriate degree of deference that should be afforded to administrative decision makers' interpretation of taxation statutes and the intersection between the reasonableness standard of review and the application of the residual presumption are also issues of general importance that extend beyond the parties to this litigation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART 2&mdash;SUMMARY OF THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The OMDC and the OIDMTC</TI>
<P>8. The OMDC is an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. It was established in 2000 to promote innovation, investment and employment in Ontario's cultural media industry, and to administer tax credit programs in furtherance of that objective.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>O Reg 672/00, ss. 1, 2, 3, 4, <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The OIDMTC is a refundable tax credit for the development of eligible interactive digital media products in Ontario. If a product is eligible for the OIDMTC, the applicant corporation may claim a percentage of its Ontario labour expenditures, and certain marketing and distribution expenditures incurred during the product's development. As a refundable tax credit, the amount of the credit, less any taxes payable, is paid to the corporation.</P>
<P>10. The OIDMTC is jointly administered by the OMDC and the Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;). Corporations can submit an application to the OMDC for a Certificate of Eligibility for a product, pursuant to s. 93 of the <EM>Act</EM>. The OMDC reviews the application, and if the product meets the legislative requirements, the OMDC will issue a Certificate of Eligibility certifying that a product is eligible for the OIDMTC. The corporation can then resubmit its certificate to the CRA, which conducts an audit and issues a refund in cases where the corporation is entitled to a refund.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Taxation Act, 2007</EM>, SO 2007 c 11 Sched A, s. 93 (8&ndash;10), <BOLD>Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Legislative Scheme</TI>
<P>11. Pong Marketing's OIDMTC application submitted to the OMDC is governed by s. 93 of <EM>the Act</EM>, and s. 34 of the <EM>Regulation</EM>.</P>
<P>12. Under s. 93 of the <EM>Act</EM>, the OMDC is responsible for determining whether a corporation is eligible for the OIDMTC, and whether a product is an eligible product for the OIDMTC.</P>
<P>13. A &ldquo;qualifying corporation&rdquo; must develop an eligible product to qualify for the OIDMTC. Eligible products are defined at s. 93(14) of the <EM>Act:</EM>

<P>15. On April 16, 2014, Pong Marketing applied to the OMDC for the OIDMTC (&ldquo;the application&rdquo;). The application concerned 15 sweepstakes games (&ldquo;the sweepstakes games&rdquo;) that Pong Marketing developed between February 2011 and March 2013. The total tax credit being sought by Pong Marketing is approximately $2 million.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>Motion Record of the OMDC (&ldquo;OMDC MR&rdquo;), Tab 3, p 13, paras 3-4</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The sweepstakes games are &ldquo;casino-style&rdquo; slot-based games that work by sequentially delivering sweepstakes prizes to the player upon the commitment of &ldquo;sweepstakes points.&rdquo; A player receives sweepstakes points each time he or she purchases a telephone card. A player can also receive points by requesting entry into a game without making a purchase. While the outcome of the game is predetermined, the number of points affects a participant's chance of winning a prize.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 14, para 16</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The OMDC Decision</TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The OMDC's Initial Review of Pong Marketing's Application</TI>
<P>20. The OMDC's initial review of Pong Marketing's development, licensing and marketing documents concluded that the sweepstakes games did not qualify for the OIDMTC because it appeared that the products' purpose was primarily promotional. In particular, the OMDC concluded that the sweepstakes games were produced for the primary purpose of selling long distance phone cards.</P>
<P>21. Pong Marketing's documents were assessed for key factors, including why and how a product was developed, what audience or target market it was developed for, and who the product was marketed to; this process included a review of Pong Marketing's template licensing agreement, website content, and screenshots of the sweepstakes games themselves.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from Jennifer Blitz to William Dawson, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. 2013 File No. 15214-01-TXM&rdquo; (November 30, 2015), <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 770</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. In arriving at its initial decision, the OMDC wrote to Pong Marketing and cited several examples from the application materials that demonstrated the sweepstakes games' primarily promotional purpose. Among them was explicit language in the template licensing agreement that defined the sweepstakes games as: &ldquo;A means of promotion to aid in the sale of long distance calling cards and other related products and services.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Template Licensing Agreement&mdash;&ldquo;Amazing 8s&rdquo;, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 234</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. Additionally, the template licensing agreement provided, in part, that:
<P1>(a) The licensor (i.e., Pong Marketing) is in the business of providing a &ldquo;delivery system&rdquo; that includes loyalty platform software, wholesale telephone communication delivery services, internet time, a database, operational hardware and operational software;</P1>
<P1>(b) The licensor's operational hardware includes the computer terminals on which the game is played;</P1>
<P1>(c) The licensee is in the business of selling long-distance calling cards, office services and related retail products and desires to use the applicant's delivery system in all its business locations;</P1>
<P1>(d) Gross profit, on which the licensing fees are based, is the money received from the purchase of long-distance phone time less the amount paid out in prizes; and</P1>
<P1>(e) The licensee is required to pay to the licensor 15 percent of the gross profit from each of the licensee's business locations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 14, para 20;</BOLD> Template Licensing Agreement&mdash;&ldquo;Amazing 8s&rdquo;, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 234</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>24. Similar language found on Pong Marketing's website described their business model as a method by which to promote telephone cards:
<P1>(a) Pong Marketing is a Telecommunication Company in the business of delivering a promotional sweepstakes system to enhance the sale of its pre-paid long distance phone time;</P1>
<P1>(b) In order to compete against the industries [sic] top competitors in the phone card market...Pong Marketing has introduced a promotional program that includes Sweepstakes games;</P1>
<P1>(c) The idea of sweepstakes is to create consumer involvement with a brand or product and thus encourage consumption of the product;</P1>
<P1>(d) The adoption of interactive video game promotions continues at an extraordinary rate, with more marketers embracing this delivery system for sweepstakes giveaways.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 15, para 23;</BOLD> Correspondence through the Online Application Portal (&ldquo;OAP&rdquo;) from OMDC to Pong Marketing, July 29, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 754</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>25. The OMDC explained to Pong Marketing that to be eligible for the tax credit, the purpose of the product must be primarily to educate, inform or entertain the user. Products deemed to be primarily promotional do not qualify. The OMDC offered Pong Marketing the opportunity to file additional documentation that might address the OMDC's concern that the purpose of the sweepstakes games is primarily promotional.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>Further Documentation Provided by Pong Marketing</TI>
<P>26. In response to the OMDC's concerns, Pong Marketing submitted additional documentation, including a document entitled &ldquo;business model clarification.&rdquo; The OMDC reviewed the business clarification model, and advised Pong Marketing that it did not address the concerns that the OMDC had raised.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence though the OAP from Pong Marketing to OMDC, September 8, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 762;</BOLD> Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc., &ldquo;Business Model Clarification Final,&rdquo; <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, pp 559-560</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. Pong Marketing subsequently filed further supporting documentation for review, which included:
<P1>(a) Game videos from each of the 15 sweepstake-games;</P1>
<P1>(b) Pictures from internet cafes where the games were being played;</P1>
<P1>(c) Marketing and game revenue materials;</P1>
<P1>(d) A YouTube demonstration video; and</P1>
<P1>(e) Screen shots from a &ldquo;Pong Studios&rdquo; website.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Supplementary Application Materials, filed by Pong Marketing on Sept. 24, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, p 561&ndash;740</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>28. The game videos provided as part of the supplementary documents allowed the OMDC the opportunity to view the content embedded in each of the sweepstakes games from the perspective of the user during gameplay. Additional items, such as photos of the venues where the games are operated, and the demonstration video that may be viewed by users, provided additional insight into the products' use from the user's perspective.</P>
<P>29. Upon reviewing these materials, the OMDC wrote to Pong Marketing on October 23, 2015, and advised that their decision regarding the primarily promotional purpose of the sweepstakes games remained unchanged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through the OAP from the OMDC to Pong Marketing, Oct. 23, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, pp 757&ndash;761</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As part of its reasons, the OMDC cited the prominent in-game promotional content in each of the 15 sweepstakes games that confronted users during gameplay.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through the OAP from the OMDC to Pong Marketing, Oct. 23, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, pp 757&ndash;759</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. In the same correspondence of October 23<SUP>rd</SUP>, the OMDC explained why it also did not find the additional items persuasive. The reasons provided by the OMDC include the following:
<P1>(a) Some of the internet caf&ea; pictures contained long distance phone card signs;</P1>
<P1>(b) Most of the marketing material submitted was not related to the sweepstakes games at issue on the OIDMTC application;</P1>
<P1>(c) The YouTube video contained an animated character that congratulates the user on purchasing a phone card;</P1>
<P1>(d) The website screenshots submitted did not match the licensing agreements submitted with the sweepstakes games.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through the OAP from the OMDC to Pong Marketing.

<BLOCK4><N>iii.</N><TI>The OMDC's Finding that the Primary Purpose of the Sweepstakes Games is Promotional</TI>
<P>31. At Pong Marketing's request, the OMDC reviewed the application again. That review was conducted by the assigned case officer, the OIDMTC Team Leader, and the OMDC Director of Tax Credits and Financing. At the conclusion of this review, the OMDC determined that the primary purpose of the sweepstakes games is promotional.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from OMDC to Pong Marketing, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. 2013 File No. 15214-01-TXM&rdquo; (November 30, 2015) <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, pp 770&ndash;775</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The OMDC issued a formal letter of ineligibility on December 11, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from OMDC to Pong Marketing, re &ldquo;OIDMTC Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. [...]&rdquo; (December 11, 2015), <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 5, p 37</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>The Divisional Court Decision</TI>
<P>33. The majority of the Divisional Court allowed Pong Marketing's application and remitted the matter back to the OMDC for reconsideration. Writing for the majority, Associate Chief Justice Marrocco (Nordheimer J., concurring) found that the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM> was unreasonable. The majority held that the only reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1) requires the ODMC to look at &ldquo;the primary purpose of the game from the perspective of the player&rdquo; because the section refers to the &ldquo;characteristics of the game when the user is playing it.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 19, para 38</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. Moreover, as the wording of s. 34(1) makes no mention of the developer, the majority held that any consideration of the developer's motivation for developing the game is irrelevant to the OMDC's assessment of whether the purpose of the games, while in operation, is primarily promotional. This reasoning flows from the majority's literal reading of the definition of &ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; under the <EM>Regulation</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>The definition focuses on the time when the application files and data files are operated together by the user <BOLD><EM>and provides that one of their characteristics at that moment is that their primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user</EM>.</BOLD> The only time the user <BOLD><EM>operates</EM></BOLD> those files is when he or she is playing a Sweepstakes game. The primary purpose of the applicant when creating or licensing the product is a different inquiry.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 18, paras 32-33</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis original]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>35. Accordingly, the majority regarded any statements from Pong Marketing's website or template licensing agreement used as a means of indicating the developer's intention when developing the sweepstakes games to be unhelpful in determining the primary purpose of the product when it is being operated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, pp 18-19, paras 37-38</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. The majority further held that even if the OMDC's interpretation of s. 34(1) is reasonable, a residual presumption that applies in favour of the taxpayer in the interpretation of taxation statutes should have been applied, by the OMDC in this case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 19, para 43</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. By contrast, in her dissenting reasons, Justice Sachs would have denied the application. Contrary to the approach taken by the majority, the dissent held that the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute warranted deference. Her Honour held that a reasonable interpretation of the legislation does not preclude the OMDC from considering the purpose for which the product is developed in determining the product's purpose:
<QUOTE><P>[...] it is not unreasonable when objectively assessing the primary purpose of a product while it is being operated to have regard to what the intended purpose of the product was when it was being developed. After all, it is the product's primary purpose that governs the analysis and it is reasonable to assume that a successfully developed product, when it is being operated, will fulfill the primary purpose for which it was developed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 27, para 84</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. Further, the dissent noted that the legislation specifically contemplates that an eligible product may have multiple purposes while it is being operated by the user. As such, it is the OMDC's statutory responsibility to determine the primary purpose of the product. In this case, the dissent noted that the OMDC is entitled to rely on its review of the sweepstakes games, among other things, to find that the primary purpose of the products while they are being operated is to encourage users to buy calling cards, and not to entertain.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 27, para 85</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. As for the residual presumption, the dissent found that the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer serves a &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; purpose, and is only applied if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation using the modem approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, Sachs J. held that the residual presumption has no application as the OMDC resolved the issue without needing to resort to the residual presumption.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 28, paras 87-88</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART 3&mdash;THE ISSUES</TI>
<P>40. If leave is granted, the OMDC proposes the following questions on appeal:
<P1>(a) Did the Divisional Court err by misinterpreting s. 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM> such that the scope of the provision is unnecessarily limited?</P1>
<P1>(b) Did the Divisional Court err in failing to give any deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and as such erroneously apply a standard of correctness?</P1>
<P1>(c) Did the Divisional Court err in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case and that it would favour the respondent?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART 4&mdash;THE LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>The Test for Leave to Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. Rule 61.03.1 provides that a motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is to be brought in writing. As set out in the case law, matters to be considered in granting leave include: (a) whether the appeal involves the interpretation of a statute or regulation including its constitutionality; (b) the interpretation, clarification or propounding of some general rule or principle of law; and (c) whether the interpretation of the law or agreement in issue is of significance only to the parties or whether a question of general interest to the public or a broad segment of the public would be settled for the future.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Sault Dock Co.

<P>42. As set out below, the OMDC submits that there is substantial merit to the three proposed issues for appeal. The proposed appeal also raises issues of public importance which are addressed in the last section of the factum.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The Majority Erred in their Interpretation of s. 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>43. The majority erred by interpreting s. 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM> as prohibiting a consideration of the purpose for which the products were developed.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The Rules of Statutory Interpretation</TI>
<P>44. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly endorsed Driedger's modem approach to statutory interpretation:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he words of an <EM>Act</EM> are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the <EM>Act</EM>, the object of the <EM>Act</EM>, and the intention of Parliament.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Elmer A.

<P>45. The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires the court to: (i) examine the words of the provision in their ordinary and grammatical sense; (ii) consider the entire context that the provision is located within; and (iii) consider whether the proposed interpretation produces a just and reasonable result.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v Rex</SOC><CITE>[2002] SCC 42</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 3;</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bapoo v Cooperators General Insurance Co</SOC><CITE>[1997] OJ No 5055</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><PARANUM>8</PARANUM><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 4</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. The factors comprising the &ldquo;entire context&rdquo; include the history of the provision at issue, its place in the overall scheme of the Act, the object of the Act itself, and the Legislature's intent in enacting the Act as a whole and the particular provision at issue. A just and reasonable result promotes applications of the Act that advance its purpose and avoids applications that are &ldquo;foolish and pointless.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pierre-Andr&ea; C&oc;t&ea;, <EM>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</EM>, 3rd ed.

<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>The Majority's Interpretation of s. 34(1) is Too Narrow</TI>
<P>47. Section 34(1) of the <EM>Regulation</EM> reads as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>34.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In this section,
<DEF><DEFP><TERM>&ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo;</TERM> means a combination of one or more application files and one or more data files, all in a digital format, that are integrated and are intended to be operated together and that have the following characteristics <UNDER>when they are being operated</UNDER>:
<PARA><N>1.</N><PARAP><UNDER>Their</UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>O. Reg. 37/09, s. 34(1), <BOLD>Schedule B</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></PARAP></PARA></DEFP></DEF></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>48. For the majority, the central concern with interpreting s. 34(1) as allowing a consideration of the developer's purpose, as favoured by the OMDC, is that the &ldquo;developer's fundamental purpose&rdquo; may weigh negatively against their eligibility for the tax credit. This, they held, is inconsistent with the Legislature's intention to use the tax credit to assist high technology, knowledge-based industries.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 18, para 35</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. Accordingly, the majority interpreted s. 34(1) as avoiding this problem by focusing on the characteristics of the product from the subjective perspective of the user while the user plays the game.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 18, para 37</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Respectfully, this interpretation is too narrow.</P>
<P>50. When read in its entire context and in the grammatical and ordinary sense, s. 34(1) does not prohibit consideration of the purpose for which a product was developed. It is evident on a plain reading of s. 34(1) that this provision can be interpreted to include the purpose for which the product was developed. The reference to &ldquo;they&rdquo; in &ldquo;when <UNDER>they</UNDER> are being operated ... <UNDER>Their</UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user&rdquo;, is a reference to the product's purpose and not the user's purpose. The user's purpose will always be subjective. Users may play games to be entertained or to benefit from the products the games promote, or both. But the developer's purpose in developing the products can be ascertained from the games and promotional materials, and is necessarily relevant to determining the game's overall purpose while they are being operated.</P>
<P>51. Focus on the purpose for which the games were developed is more consistent with the purpose for which the OIDMTC is made available. Contrary to the majority's premise, and as correctly identified in the dissent, the tax credit is intended to facilitate growth in the cultural media sector and not the interactive digital media industry writ large.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 26, para 77</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The determination as to whether a product is eligible for the OIDMTC is a task that has been delegated to the OMDC. The OMDC's mandate is to &ldquo;foster the development and enhancement of the cultural media industry in Ontario.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 26, para 77</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This mandate is not, however, intended to create jobs generally in the digital media industry, but rather to &ldquo;create jobs in particular sectors&rdquo; of that industry.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 26, para 77</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. For this reason the <EM>Regulation</EM> requires an assessment of the product's primary purpose to ensure that it is intended to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; If the intention was simply to create jobs through a broadly administered tax credit, then all interactive digital media products, and in particular all digital interactive games, regardless of their predominant purpose, would qualify. This is not what the Legislature intended.</P>
<P>53. Viewed in this way, there is a logical link between a product developer's intention and the end product's operation. As Sachs J. stated, it is &ldquo;reasonable to assume that a product when operated successfully will fulfill the primary purpose for which it was developed.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 27, para 84</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> When the primary purpose of a product is the focal point for determining eligibility for a tax credit, it is reasonable to refer to the developer's intention as the OMDC did in this case.</P>
<P>54. Accordingly, by focusing on the subjective purpose for which a user may play one of the sweepstakes games, the majority interpreted s. 34(1) too narrowly, and without reference to the wording of the provision as a whole and the purpose of the OIDMTC. In addition, as set out below, the majority failed to accord the deference owed to the OMDC in interpreting its own statute.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>The Majority Erred by Failing to Grant the OMDC's Decision Any Deference</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The majority's decision misapplies the reasonableness standard of review to the OMDC's decision. Rather than assessing the OMDC's decision against the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, the majority substituted its own interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> for that of the OMDC. As such, the majority arguably applied a standard of correctness and failed to grant the OMDC's decision the deference to which it is entitled.</P>

<P>59. In the particular context of statutory interpretation, the Court cannot substitute its view of the interpretation and application of the statute for that of the OMDC's reasonably held view. The Supreme Court of Canada articulated this view forcefully in <CASEREF><SOC>Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>At the outset it is helpful to contrast judicial review according to the standard of reasonableness with the fundamentally different process of reviewing a decision for correctness. When undertaking a correctness review, the court may undertake its own reasoning process to arrive at the result it judges correct. In contrast, <EM>when deciding whether an administrative action was unreasonable, a court should not at any point ask itself what the correct decision would have been</EM>. Applying the standard of reasonableness gives effect to the legislative intention that a specialized body will have the primary responsibility of deciding the issue according to its own process and for its own reasons. <EM>The standard of reasonableness does not imply that a decision-maker is merely afforded a &ldquo;margin of error&rdquo; around what the court believes is the correct result</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 20</CITE><PARANUM>50</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Ta b 8</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>No Deference was granted to the OMDC's Interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> and Decision</TI>
<P>60. The OMDC is a specialized agency with expertise in the interpretation and application of the relevant statutory provisions. The question of whether the &ldquo;primary purpose&rdquo; of a promotional game is to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user&rdquo; is a question of law and fact and is at the core of the OMDC's function.</P>
<P>61. In this case, the OMDC determined that the sweepstakes games were developed primarily as promotional vehicles for selling phone cards. This decision was reasonably made having considered each of the sweepstakes games while in operation from the user's perspective, and the developer's intention when developing the games. This conclusion was intelligible and justified based on the wording of the <EM>Regulation</EM>, intent of the <EM>Act</EM>, and on the materials submitted by Pong Marketing.</P>
<P>62. The majority's decision did not examine whether the OMDC's decision fell within a range of possible outcomes. Instead, the majority substituted their interpretation of s. 34(1) for that of the OMDC, and ignored evidence showing that the OMDC did consider the promotional content of the products presented to the users while in operation.</P>
<P>63. On its review of the application, the OMDC concluded that Pong Marketing developed the sweepstakes games to be used as promotional platforms by a licensee to promote products to the end user of the game. As found by the OMDC, Pong Marketing's template licensing agreement and website content demonstrates how Pong Marketing anticipated the sweepstakes games would be used by the licensee.</P>
<P>64. On the basis of its application materials, it was reasonable for the OMDC to conclude that the games were designed by Pong Marketing to be used as loyalty platform software by licensees, to market their products (i.e., phone cards) to the user.</P>
<P>65. The OMDC also considered the promotional content of each of the 15 sweepstakes games while in operation from the user's perspective. The OMDC's correspondence to Pong Marketing, dated October 28, 2015, sets out in detail the OMDC's observations; regarding the promotional content as it appears to users in each of the sweepstakes games.</P>
<P>66. The OMDC concluded that its assessment of the sweepstakes games supports its decision that their primary purpose is to promote the sale of calling cards.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Correspondence through the OAP from the OMDC to Pong Marketing, October 23, 2015, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 6, pp 757&ndash;761</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This decision is entitled to deference, especially since it did include a review of the promotional content in the games themselves which the majority failed to acknowledge.</P>
<P>67. It is important to note that the OMDC's interpretation and application of s. 34(1) does not assume that users cannot be entertained when operating Pong Marketing's products. As noted in dissent, the legislation specifically contemplates that products can serve multiple purposes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 27, para 85</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the Legislature delegated responsibility to the OMDC to use its expertise in the subject matter and in its interpretation of its home statute to administer the tax credit. Where it has done so reasonably, as it has here, the OMDC is entitled to deference.</P>
<P>68. By failing to consider whether the OMDC's interpretation was justifiable, transparent, and intelligible based on the materials submitted by Pong Marketing, the majority failed to review the decision on a reasonableness standard and instead erroneously applied a standard of correctness. Where the expertise of the OMDC is engaged, as it is here, deference must be granted and respect given to the Legislature's decision to leave such matters in the hands of the OMDC to draw on its particular expertise and experience.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>[2008] 1 SCR 190</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 6</BOLD> (excerpt)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>No Residual Presumption Applies in the Circumstances of the Present Case</UNDER></TI>
<P>69. The majority further erred in finding that the residual presumption in favour of taxpayers would have any application in this case and that it would favour Pong Marketing. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the residual presumption has a limited purpose and must only be applied in &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; cases. This is not the case where the residual presumption applies.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>The Residual Presumption Applies only in Exceptional Circumstances</TI>
<P>70. There is no longer any rule of statutory interpretation that requires ambiguities in tax-related statutes to be read in favour of taxpayers. If there are two interpretations, the more reasonable one must prevail. When there are two interpretations and one cannot be said to be the more reasonable than the other, the choice should then be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ontario Cancer Institute (c.o.b.

<P>71. Where the residual presumption applies, its application is limited to &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; circumstances. In <CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon Secours</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court explained the limitation of the residual presumption as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[...] first, recourse to the presumption in the taxpayer's favour is indicated when a court is compelled to choose between two valid interpretations, and second, this <BOLD>presumption</BOLD> is <BOLD>clearly residual</BOLD> and should play an exceptional part in the interpretation of tax legislation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v Corp.

<QUOTE><P>[...] Any doubt about the meaning of a taxation statute must be reasonable, and no recourse to the presumption lies unless the usual rules of interpretation have been applied, <UNDER>to no avail</UNDER>, in an attempt to discern the meaning of the provision at issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v Ontario (Minister of Finance)</SOC><CITE>[2006] 1 SCR 715</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 12</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>There is No Ambiguity in the Interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation Warranting Application of the Residual Presumption</TI>
<P>73. The majority erred in their application of the residual presumption in the circumstances of this case. In their reasons, the majority declined to resort to the residual presumption because they found on an application of the ordinary rules of interpretation that the OMDC's interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> was unreasonable.</P>
<P>74. Yet, the majority held in the alternative, that even if the OMDC's interpretation is also reasonable<SUP>55</SUP>, the application of the residual presumption requires the Court to favour the interpretation which is more favourable to Pong Marketing.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 19, para 43</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this circumstance, the application of the residual presumption is incongruent with the principles governing judicial review on a reasonableness standard of review where a decision has been held to be reasonable.</P>
<P>75. In <CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court held that where there are two reasonable competing interpretations of a decision-maker's home statute, the reviewing court must side with the decision-maker:
<QUOTE><P>The bottom line here, then, is that the Commission holds the interpretative upper hand: under reasonableness review, we defer to <EM>any</EM> reasonable interpretation adopted by an administrative decision maker, <EM>even if</EM> other reasonable interpretations may exist. Because the legislature charged the administrative decision maker rather than the courts with &ldquo;administer[ing] and apply[ing]&rdquo; its home statute (<EM>Pezim</EM>, at p. 596), it is the decision maker, first and foremost, that has the discretion to resolve a statutory uncertainty by adopting any interpretation that the statutory language can reasonably bear. Judicial deference in such; instances is itself a principle of modern statutory interpretation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 SCR 895</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 7</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis original]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>76. Because deference is owed to the decision-maker, the applicant has the high burden of proving not only that their interpretation is reasonable, but that the decision-maker's interpretation is <EM>unreasonable</EM>. The Supreme Court framed the applicant's burden this way:
<QUOTE><P>Accordingly, the appellant's burden here is not only to show that her competing interpretation is reasonable, but also that the Commission's interpretation is <EM>unreasonable</EM>. And that she has not done. Here, the Commission, with the benefit of its expertise, chose the interpretation it did. And because that interpretation has not been shown to be an unreasonable one, there is no basis for us to interfere on judicial review&mdash;even in the face of a competing reasonable interpretation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 SCR 895</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>OMDC BOA, Tab 7</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>77. Therefore, the majority's resort to the residual presumption where they have found the OMDC's decision to be reasonable stands at odds with both the principles underlying the residual presumption, as well as the well-established administrative law principles guiding the reasonableness standard of review.</P>
<P>78. For this reason, Sachs J. properly discredited the majority's reliance on the residual presumption on the basis that the OMDC's decision is reasonable. Upon restating the &ldquo;very limited&rdquo; role played by the residual presumption, Sachs J. held that because the OMDC was able to ascertain a reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1), the presumption has no application in this case and should not be granted in favour of Pong Marketing. In her dissent, Sachs J. writes:
<QUOTE><P><CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours</SOC><CITE>1994 CanLII 58</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 3</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>171 N.R. 161</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> and the cases that have followed it have made it clear that the presumption at issue now has a very limited role to play in the interpretation of tax legislation. It is a residual presumption that should only be resorted to if it is not possible to resolve the meaning of the legislation by applying Driedger's modem approach to statutory interpretation. In this case, the OMDC was able to resolve the meaning of the legislation in question without resort to the residual presumption. A reasonableness review requires that the OMDC's decision in this regard be respected unless it falls outside the range of possible and acceptable outcomes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court Decision, <BOLD>OMDC MR, Tab 3, p 28, para 88</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>79. Accordingly, the majority erroneously held that the residual presumption would be applied in Pong Marketing's favour having found that the OMDC's interpretation of the <EM>Regulation</EM> was reasonable. This holding conflicts with the scope of the reviewing court's authority on a reasonableness standard of review and does not give rise to. the exceptional circumstances necessary to apply the residual presumption.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>It is Both Desirable and in the Public Interest to Grant Leave to Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>80. Pursuant to Rule.61.03.1, it is both desirable and in the public interest for leave to be granted in this case. The proposed appeal raises many issues of general importance, including the following:
<P1>(a) The <EM>Act</EM> is a statute of general application and interest in the proper interpretation of taxation legislation extends to the general public.</P1>
<P1>(b) The proposed appeal concerns what factors the OMDC can review for future OIDMTC applications, which in turn affects how employers in the cultural media sector will arrange their affairs to benefit from the tax credit and thus continue to create employment opportunities.</P1>
<P1>(c) The proposed appeal examines the appropriate degree of deference that should be afforded to administrative decision makers' interpretation of taxation statutes and examines the intersection between the reasonableness standard of review and the application of the residual presumption.</P1></P>
<P>81. For the foregoing reasons, the OMDC submits that the issues set out above are arguable and of general public importance. They involve the interpretation of an <EM>Act</EM> and <EM>Regulation</EM> and fits within the criteria established by this court in <EM>Sault Dock Company and Limited and Joseph LaRue</EM> as grounds upon which leave may be granted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDING PARTY</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>1)</N><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>1. The Ontario Media Development Corporation (&ldquo;OMDC&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Moving Party&rdquo;) spends most of its factum attempting to convince this Court that the Divisional Court erred in rejecting the OMDC's position. The Divisional Court did not err. Regardless, the ultimate merits of the OMDC's position is not the most important consideration on this motion. The central question for the Court at this stage is whether this case raises an issue of public importance that warrants the consumption of further judicial resources. It does not. Accordingly, the Moving Party's request for leave to appeal should be denied.</P>
<P>2. On any assessment the decision below was a fact-driven application of a narrow statutory provision to an idiosyncratic set of circumstances. The parties are largely in agreement on the well-established and uncontroversial legal principles applied by the Divisional Court. The proposed appeal engages no broader public importance and a second review of the OMDC decision appeal is unwarranted.</P>
<P>3. Indeed, it is well established that where, as here, &ldquo;... the resolution of the question would largely have <BOLD><EM>significance only to the parties and would not settle for the future a question of general interest to the public or a broad segment of the public</EM>,</BOLD> the requirements to obtain leave will not have been met.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sault Dock Co. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City)</SOC><CITE>[1972] OJ. No. 2069</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at p. 2, Moving Party's Book of Authorities [&ldquo;MPBOA&rdquo;], Tab 1. (emphasis added)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. The OMDC's factum evidences demonstrates the narrow implications of the present case. It rehearses its arguments from the court below and emphasizes the dissenting judgment in the Divisional Court which supports the Moving Party's position, but does not show why this case has broader public importance.</P>
<P>5. In any event, the majority of the Divisional Court decision was right. Their decision was based on s. 34(1) of O. Reg. 37/09 (&ldquo;the Regulations&rdquo;); the OMDC's interpretation of that provision was considered and properly rejected. Even if the proposed appeal engaged any broader issues of statutory interpretation or policy there is plainly no basis to disturb the Divisional Court's conclusion.</P>
<P>6. The Responding Party accepts as substantially correct the facts set out in the Moving Party's Factum and relies upon the following additional facts.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>2)</N><TI>Pong's Business Model</TI>
<P>7. Pong Game Studios Corporation (previously Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc.) (&ldquo;Pong&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Respondent&rdquo;) is a digital studio based in Ontario that designs interactive digital games. The Respondent's library of games includes the fifteen &ldquo;sweepstakes&rdquo; games at issue here (&ldquo;the Gaming Products&rdquo;). These games are slot-machine type games in which the player typically has a number of spins. The Gaming Products have creative designs and unique themes that make them fun for the user.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Descriptions of the Gaming Products, including pictures, may be found in the Moving Party's Motion Record [&ldquo;MPMR&rdquo;], Tab 6, pp. 641&ndash;739. In addition, a printout from Pong's website, which gives examples from its current library of games (including some of the Gaming Products), is included in the Responding Party's Motion Record [&ldquo;RPMR&rdquo;], Tab 1. (It may also be found online at <UNDER>http://pongstudios.com/products.html</UNDER>)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. Pong obtains revenue from the Gaming Products by licensing them to third parties, such as telecommunication companies. These third parties use the Gaming Products to promote their own products. Because Pong's games are entertaining to play, they are conducive to providing this promotional opportunity. That is always going to be the case with digital games. As the producers of The Price is Right (or any other game show) would attest, games that are entertaining tend to serve as a good vehicle for promotion.</P>
<P>9. All of Pong's revenue, however, is derived from having users play and enjoy the game. Entertainment is therefore Pong's focus; promotion potential is secondary and completely under the control of the third-party licensee.</P></BLOCK2>

<P>10. The Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (&ldquo;Digital Media Tax Credit&rdquo;) was introduced in 1998. It was designed to create &ldquo;good-paying jobs in the high-tech industries&rdquo; such as interactive digital media.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 36th Parl, 2nd Sess, No L064B (3 Dec 1998) at 2020 (Bert Johnson), RPMR, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The aim behind the Digital Media Tax Credit was thus to &ldquo;help businesses in these industries grow and contribute to the development of long-term, internationally viable Ontario industries with jobs for the future.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. at 2120.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Digital Media Tax Credit was expanded in 2006, 2008, and 2009 with the aim to &ldquo;encourage individuals to invest&rdquo; in the area of digital media.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See</EM> Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 38th Parl, 2nd Sess, No L116A (31 Oct 2006) at 1630 (Hon Michael A Brown), RPMR, Tab 3. <EM>See also</EM> <CASEREF><SOC>Pong Marketing and Promotions Inc. v.

<P>11. Pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Regulations, a &ldquo;non-specified&rdquo; product may eligible for the Digital Media Credit if it is &ldquo;an interactive digital media product&rdquo; and the product is not captured by one of the listed exceptions in s. 34(3). Subsection 34(3) in relevant part provides:

<P>12. Thus, an interactive digital media product will not be eligible for the Digital Media Tax Credit if its primary use is to promote <UNDER>the applicant</UNDER> or <UNDER>the applicant's products</UNDER>. The provision contains no reference to the promotion of a third party's products.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>4)</N><TI>OMDC's guidelines and the evolution of the Digital Media Tax Credit</TI>
<P>13. The OMDC has published Guidelines related to the Digital Media Tax Credit. The Guidelines explain, among other things, how eligibility for the credit is determined.</P>
<P>14. The OMDC amended the Guidelines in or around June 2015 in light of proposed amendments to the Regulations (which ultimately went into effect in March 2017). The amended Guidelines also provided additional clarity on the eligibility requirements. The Guidelines explained that products would be considered primarily promotional <UNDER>unless</UNDER> they had a &ldquo;revenue generating stream&rdquo;. According to the OMDC, revenue generating streams include:
<ITEM><P>The sale of the product;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD>Fees for use of the product, including licence and subscription fees; In-product purchases (also called an in-game or in-app purchase, which occurs when the user can purchase an enhancement to the product);</BOLD></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P><BOLD>Third party advertising within the product (marketing and promotion of a corporation or person, or products or services of a corporation or person, that is not related to the product developer or the purchaser corporation in the case of a specified product);</BOLD> and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The sale or licence of another product developed by your company that can reasonably be considered an extension or upgrade of the product.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (OIDMTC) Guidelines (updated June 2015), RPMR, Tab 4 (emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>5)</N><TI>Application of the Digital Media Tax Credit to other digital media companies</TI>
<P>15. In light of these Guidelines, the OMDC has granted entitlement to the Digital Media Tax Credit to companies that, like Pong, produce digital games that promote the products of third-party licensees. Fuel Industries (&ldquo;Fuel&rdquo;) is one example. Fuel has benefited from at least $3 million in credits from the OMDC.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Ontario, Legislative Assembly, Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, <EM>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</EM>, 41st Parl, 1st Sess, F-9 (22 January 2015) (Hon Sue Wong) at F-144. (<EM>See generally</EM> F-142-44), RPMR, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to its website, Fuel &ldquo;helps Fortune 500 global brands connect with GenZ, Millennial and Family audiences using deep, digital brand experiences that include immersive virtual worlds, mobile apps and social gaming, branded entertainment, interactive multi-screen experiences, interactive rich media advertising, and digital loyalty programs.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;About&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/about</UNDER>, RPMR, Tab 6A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Fuel's games include such offerings as <EM>NASCAR: Acceleration Nation, Disney Junior Magic Phone, DreamWorks DreamPlace: Naughty or Nice</EM>, and <EM>McDonald's: Cut the Rope</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/work</UNDER>, RPMR, Tab 6B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Fuel boasts on its website that one of its games, available through McDonald's &ldquo;Magic Camera&rdquo; application, &ldquo;led to a 500% increase of the Magic Camera app downloads vs the previous month.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fuel Industries, &ldquo;How to Train Your Dragon 2&rdquo;, online: <UNDER>http://www.fuelyouth.com/projects/how-to-train-yourdragon-2/,</UNDER> RPMR, Tab 6C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Fuel was undoubtedly awarded eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit because its games are designed for entertainment and its products have an independent revenue generating stream; moreover, the (extensive) promotional content in Fuel's games is aimed at promoting the products of a third party, not Fuel's own products. Fuel, like Pong, is not excluded by any of the listed exceptions in s. 34(3).</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>6)</N><TI>Pong's Application for the Digital Media Tax Credit</TI>
<P>17. Pong applied for the Digital Media Tax Credit for the Gaming Products on April 16, 2014. Pong sought a tax credit of approximately $2 million. The claimed amount represented the work of over 60 Pong game developers, testers, mathematicians, and designers, constituting 90% of Pong's employees at the time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See</EM> Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 4; <EM>see also</EM> MPMR, Tab 6, at p. 768.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. Pong expended significant resources developing the Gaming Products on the expectation that it would, according to the plain meaning of the relevant provision, receive the Digital Media Tax Credit. Pong was anxious to receive these funds in order to reinvest in its business and employ additional people at its Woodbridge, Ontario facility.</P>
<P>19. On December 11, 2015, almost <UNDER>two years</UNDER> after its application was submitted, the OMDC notified the Respondent that its application had been denied.</P>
<P>20. The decision was conveyed in a brief letter from the OMDC's Director of Tax Credits and Financing Programs. The letter stated, in conclusory terms, that the products did not satisfy s. 34(1) of the Digital Media Tax Credit Regulations because their primary purpose was not to &ldquo;educate, inform or entertain the user.&rdquo; Rather, the OMDC concluded the primary purpose of the products was &ldquo;to promote the sale of phonecards and other related products and services.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from J. Blitz to W. Dawson (Dec. 11, 2015), MPMR, Tab 5, p. 37.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;POSITION ON ISSUES</TI>
<P>21. The Moving Party proposes three issues.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Party's Factum, at para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Properly understood the present motion presents the following questions:
<P1>(a) Did the Divisional Court err in concluding that, according to the plain meaning of s. 34(1) of the Regulations, the &ldquo;primary purpose&rdquo; of the Gaming Products is to entertain the user?</P1>
<P1>(b) Does this appeal raise issues of public importance such that this Honourable Court should take the exceptional step of granting leave to appeal a decision of the Divisional Court?</P1></P>
<P>22. The issues raised by the appeal proposed by the Moving Party are in no sense of public importance and do not disclose the sort of uncertainty in the jurisprudence that might justify the unusual step of a second level of review. Regardless, the Divisional Court was right and its decision should not be disturbed. Leave should be refused.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Did the Divisional Court err in concluding that, according to the plain meaning of s. 34(1) of O. Reg 37/09, the &ldquo;primary purpose&rdquo; of the Gaming Products is to entertain the user?</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>1)</N><TI>The Divisional Court's application of s. 34(1) of the Regulations to the facts of this case was correct.</TI>
<P>23. The Moving Party argues that the Divisional Court's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulation &ldquo;is too narrow and reads in limitations to the scope of the provision that undermine legislative intent.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Party's Factum, at para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With respect, this is the pot calling the kettle black. The Divisional Court's interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulations is the only reasonable interpretation available in light of the plain language of the provision and the object and purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit. In contrast, the OMDC's interpretation is ungrounded in the words of the Regulations and calculated to contrive an overly restrictive reading that clashes with the language of the provision and its legislative purpose.</P>
<P>24. The Divisional Court examined the plain language of s. 34(1), which defines an &ldquo;interactive digital media product&rdquo; as:
<QUOTE><P>... <EM>a combination of</EM> one or more <EM>application files</EM> and one or more <EM>data files</EM>, all in a digital format, that are integrated and are intended to be operated together and <EM>that have the following characteristics when they are being operated:</EM></P>
<P>1. <UNDER><EM>Their</EM></UNDER> primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 26 (underlining added by Divisional Court; other emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. The Divisional Court rightly pointed out that the &ldquo;their&rdquo; in s. 34(1) of the Regulations obviously refers to the &ldquo;application files&rdquo; or the &ldquo;data files&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. at para. 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Put simply, the provision indicates that a digital game will be an interactive digital media product if the primary purpose of <UNDER>the game</UNDER>, <UNDER>while it is being played</UNDER>, is to entertain <UNDER>the user</UNDER>. No other reasonable reading of the Regulations is credibly available. Had the Regulations intended to focus on the developer, it could have, and would have, said so.</P>
<P>26. As the Divisional Court summarized (at para. 33):
<QUOTE><P>The definition focuses on the time when the application files and data files are operated together by the user and provides that one of their characteristics at that moment is that their primary purpose is to educate, inform or entertain the user. The only time the user operates those files is when he or she is playing a Sweepstakes game. The primary purpose of the applicant when creating or licensing the product is a different inquiry.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. In addition to emphasizing the unambiguous language of the provision, the Divisional Court explained why the OMDC's interpretation clashes with the object and purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit.</P>
<P>28. The OMDC felt that the primary purpose of the Gaming Products was not to entertain the user because the games were designed to, among other things, &ldquo;help licensees or retailers compete against top competitors in the phone card market&rdquo; and &ldquo;create consumer involvement with a brand or product to encourage consumption of that product.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. at para. 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. That reading of the provision is simply unreasonable and ungrounded in the words. Whatever measure of deference one offers to the OMDC, at some point words have obvious meanings that must be respected. The OMDC's approach is unsustainable.</P>
<P>30. It flies in the face of the Digital Media Tax Credit's entire reason for existence: to create jobs in Ontario in the digital media industry.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See</EM> Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong creates digital games that are entertaining. It employs dozens of people and expends significant resources in the development process. Pong's underlying motivation is, of course, to create profit by selling or licensing its games to third parties. That is the case with all for-profit entities.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See id</EM>. at para. 40:
<QUOTE><P>The respondent submitted that the Ontario Media Development Corporation has a cultural aspect to it&mdash;a submission with which I agree. I recognize that the digital media tax credit is available to not-for-profit arts and cultural enterprises. I also recognize that those corporations do not have a profit motive. I do not believe this makes any difference to the proper interpretation of the regulation. The tax credit was introduced to benefit or assist the development of the interactive digital media industry. At the same time tax credits were introduced to benefit sound recording, computer animation and special effects companies and thereby create jobs in Ontario. The inclusion of not-for-profit arts and cultural enterprises was not accompanied by a corresponding restriction on the availability of this credit to for-profit corporations.</P></QUOTE></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong's games are attractive to third parties <BOLD><EM>because they entertain</EM></BOLD> and therefore offer an effective vehicle for the promotion of their products.</P>
<P>31. Furthermore, in licensing its games to third parties, Pong (like Fuel, above) is also complying with a <UNDER>pre-requisite</UNDER> for eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit as set out in the OMDC's Guidelines&mdash;namely, that the product have a revenue generating stream. The Guidelines explicitly indicate that revenue generating streams may include licensing fees for use of the product and third party advertising within the product, which may come from promotion of the third party and/or the third party's products. In fact, without a revenue generating stream, the OMDC has indicated that it will consider the product to be primarily promotional. The OMDC cannot reasonably mandate that the product have a revenue generating stream and then punish the applicant for marketing its product in a way that derives revenue.</P>
<P>32. The OMDC's interpretation would create the perverse situation where digital gaming companies are forced to choose between licensing opportunities and eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit. That approach would actually <EM>discourage</EM> investment in the digital media field. Such an interpretation would defeat the purpose behind the Digital Media Tax Credit and is absurd. It is, therefore, unreasonable.</P>
<P>33. Indeed, as Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O. noted for the majority of the Divisional Court, it is nonsensical to cite the developer's profit-making motive as a reason for disqualifying it from the tax credit:
<QUOTE><P>A developer intending to license games will primarily want the games to promote the product of the licensee otherwise the licensee will not want the games. The respondent's reliance on this motivation or statements of it to conclude that the developer's product is primarily promotional and therefore not eligible for the tax credit means that the developer's fundamental purpose weighs negatively against eligibility for the tax credit, even though the legislature intended to use the tax credit to assist high-technology, knowledge-based industries.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, para. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>34. Thus, in denying Pong's application for the Digital Media Tax Credit, the OMDC conflated Pong's <UNDER>business model</UNDER> with its <UNDER>products' purpose</UNDER>. Pong develops its games to be entertaining to the user. Once developed, however, Pong must sell or license the games in order to derive revenue from them. Without revenue, it cannot create jobs.</P>
<P>35. The OMDC claims that the Divisional Court erred by focusing on the user's purpose for playing the games instead of the developer's purpose for developing the games. It says the user's purpose is less important because it &ldquo;will always be subjective&rdquo; and therefore difficult to pin down; the developer's purpose, in contrast, is discernable through, for example, the developer's promotional materials.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See</EM> Moving Party's Factum, at para. 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This does not make sense, and in any event does not come close to what the section actually says.</P>
<P>36. The user's purpose for playing Pong's digital games is not nebulous. It is obvious: users play the games to be entertained. Users do not play the games for their promotional content; the promotional content is placed in the game by a third party seeking to take advantage of the user's captivated attention.</P>
<P>37. Every developer's motivation is fixed: it is to derive revenue from the games. That is why the Regulations' language focuses on the user, not the developer. Focusing on the developer would mean that only not-for-profit product development would qualify for the credit. But that would render the Digital Media Tax Credit unobtainable (because of the requirement of revenue).</P>
<P>38. The OMDC contends that under the Divisional Court's interpretation of the provision &ldquo;all interactive digital media products, and in particular all digital interactive games, regardless of their predominant purpose, would qualify.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. at para. 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This concern is without merit and easily dismissed. There is a litany of digital media products that would not be eligible for the tax credit because their primary purpose while being operated is not to &ldquo;educate, inform, or entertain&rdquo; the user. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Venngo Inc. v. Ontario Media Development Corp.</SOC><CITE>[2013] O.J. No. 961</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the Divisional Court upheld the OMDC's ruling that a coupon website did not qualify for the Digital Media Tax Credit. Nor would every digital game qualify. The legislature has placed express limits on eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit by, for example, excluding products that promote the applicant's <UNDER>own</UNDER> products or services.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See</EM> s. 34(3) of the Regulations, <EM>supra</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> And, most significantly, as the Divisional Court pointed out, <BOLD><EM>&ldquo;[i]f the [OMDC] thinks that the regulation, properly interpreted, is not achieving the intended objective or is overly generous, then it is open to the Government to amend the regulation</EM>,&rdquo;</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 39 (emphasis added).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. The government has, in fact, recently amended the Regulation and narrowed eligibility for the Digital Media Tax Credit. That is within its prerogative. It is <UNDER>not</UNDER>, however, open to the Moving Party to move the Court to retroactively read in limitations that did not exist at the relevant time.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2)</N><TI>The Divisional Court applied a reasonableness standard of review and granted deference to the OMDC.</TI>
<P>40. The Moving Party argues that the Divisional Court did not &ldquo;grant deference to the OMDC's interpretation of its home statute, and in doing so, erroneously appl[ied] a standard of correctness.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Party's Factum, at para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This assertion is groundless.</P>
<P>41. The Divisional Court applied a standard of reasonableness to the OMDC's decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, para. 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Quoting from <EM>Venngo</EM>, the Court found that the interpretation of s. 34(1) of the Regulations is &ldquo;a question that concerns OMDC's interpretation of its home legislation and is exactly the type of issue that falls within the OMDC's specialized expertise. The question ... lies at the core of the OMDC's function.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>., quoting <EM>Venngo</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. The problem is that the OMDC's reading of the provision was unreasonable. Deference does not mean a body like the OMDC is a law unto itself. It remains subject to review. In approaching the OMDC's decision the Court referenced <CASEREF><SOC>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</SOC></CASEREF>, which states that &ldquo;an unreasonable decision [i]s one that did not stand up to a somewhat probing analysis.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2003 SCC 20, at para. 25, MPBOA, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Court conducted such an analysis and rightly concluded that the OMDC's decision could not withstand somewhat probing scrutiny.</P>
<P>43. What the OMDC really takes issue with is the fact that the Divisional Court found its decision to be unreasonable. That complaint is unfounded.</P>
<P>44. A reasonableness standard accords deference to an administrative body's decisions; it does not <UNDER>immunize</UNDER> all decisions made by that administrative body. Here, the Divisional Court applied the correct standard of review and found that the OMDC's application of the Regulations in these circumstances was unreasonable. There is no basis to interfere with that finding.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3)</N><TI>The Divisional Court's discussion of the residual presumption was strictly <EM>obiter</EM> and played no role in the decision below.</TI>
<P>45. The Moving Party argues that the majority of the Divisional Court erred by &ldquo;[m]isapplying the residual presumption to the circumstances of this case.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This contention is also baseless.</P>
<P>46. The residual presumption states that &ldquo;a reasonable doubt, not resolved by the ordinary rules of interpretation,&rdquo; regarding the applicability of a tax credit &ldquo;will be settled by recourse to [a] residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Id</EM>. at para. 43, quoting <CASEREF><SOC>Qu&ea;bec (Communaut&ea; urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours</SOC><CITE>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 3</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>, MPBOA, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. As a preliminary matter, the Divisional Court did not <UNDER>apply</UNDER> the residual presumption. It therefore could not have <UNDER>mis</UNDER>applied it. The majority's reasons were very clear that it was <UNDER>not</UNDER> resorting to the residual presumption, due to its conclusion that the OMDC's decision was unreasonable. Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O. was unambiguous on this point; as he wrote: &ldquo;I do not find it necessary to resort to this principle to resolve this application because I do not think the respondent's interpretation is a reasonable one.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Divisional Court's Reasons, at para. 43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. In any event, the parties are essentially <EM>ad idem</EM> on the applicability of the residual presumption. The OMDC writes that &ldquo;[w]hen there are two interpretations and one cannot be said to be the more reasonable than the other, the choice should then be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Moving Party's Factum, at para. 70.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Pong agrees with this statement and so would Marrocco A.C.J.S.C.O.</P>
<P>49. The real point of disagreement between the Moving Party and the Respondent is whether the OMDC's decision was reasonable. Imagine for a moment that the OMDC's reading is one of the reasonable readings of the Regulations. The Court would then be faced with a situation in which there are <EM>two competing reasonable interpretations</EM>. In that situation, as the OMDC admits, &ldquo;the choice should [] be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.&rdquo; Accordingly, Pong would still be entitled to the Digital Media Tax Credit.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Does this appeal raise issues of public importance such that this Honourable Court should take the exceptional step of granting leave to appeal a decision of the Divisional Court?</TI>
<P>50. Nothing about the appeal as framed by the Moving Party calls for any consideration of the law that could have broader implications for the justice system or the governing jurisprudence. There is nothing to suggest other cases will be directly or indirectly impacted by the issues proposed here. At best, the concerns raised by the Moving Party are strictly limited to the facts of this case, and, therefore, do not meet the test for granting leave to appeal. And, more to the point&mdash;<BOLD><EM>if related to the reading of the Regulations, it is entirely within the power of the government to amend the Regulations</EM>.</BOLD></P>
<P>51. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the Divisional Court is intended to be extraordinary (thus the requirement that a party obtain leave of the court).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>See, e.g., Sault Dock Co</EM>., <EM>supra</EM>, at p. 2; <CASEREF><SOC>Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. v. Froese</SOC><CITE>[2013] O.J. No. 896</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 19, Responding Party's Book of Authorities [&ldquo;RPBOA&rdquo;], Tab 1; <CASEREF><SOC>Reid v. College of Chiropractors of Ontario</SOC><CITE>[2016] O.J. No. 5450</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para. 19, RPBOA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The primary consideration on a motion for leave to appeal in such a case is whether the proposed appeal raises important issues deserving of consideration by this Court. In answering this question the Court will consider a number of factors, including:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ontario (Minister of Transportation) v. 1520658 Ontario Inc.</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 32</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF>, RPBOA, Tab 3; <EM>Sault Dock Co</EM>., <EM>supra</EM> at p. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>a) whether the Divisional Court exercised appellate jurisdiction (in which case the applicant for leave is seeking an extraordinary <EM>second</EM> appeal) or whether the Divisional Court was sitting as a court of original jurisdiction;</P1>
<P1>b) whether the appeal involves the interpretation of a statute or regulation, including its constitutionality;</P1>
<P1>c) whether the appeal involved the interpretation, clarification or propounding of some general rule or principle of law; and</P1>
<P1>d) whether the interpretation of the law or agreement in issue is of significance only to the parties or whether a question of general interest to the public or a broad segment of the public would be settled for the future.</P1></P>
<P>52. The extraordinary step of granting leave to appeal is unjustified because the Divisional Court's decision was largely fact-driven. The factual matrix raised by this case is unique, of limited importance or general interest to the public, and very unlikely to arise again. It is trite law that in such circumstances leave to appeal is unwarranted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Enbridge</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. Indeed, the Moving Party accepts as correct the legal tests applied by the majority in the Divisional Court. The Moving Party agrees, for example, that the Divisional Court applied the appropriate standard of review. And the Moving Party further agrees with the Divisional Court that the residual presumption has no applicability in this case.</P>
<P>54. The OMDC's point of disagreement is with the manner in which the majority in the Divisional Court applied these uncontroversial legal principles to the distinct facts of this case. That is an insufficient reason to grant a second level of review.</P>
<P>55. For the reasons set out above, the proposed appeal also lacks the sort of merit that might justify the granting of leave. The Divisional Court was correct in its approach and its conclusions related to the the Digital Media Tax Credit that arose on the facts. Leave to appeal should be denied.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
