<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>THE DEFENDANTS <UNDER>2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED</UNDER>, MIKE ALLEN AND CLARK KENT APPEAL to the Court of Appeal from the Judgement of the Honourable Justice Boswell dated March 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018 made at Barrie.</P>
<P>THE APPELLANTS <UNDER>2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED</UNDER>, MIKE ALLEN AND CLARK KENT ASK that the Judgment be set aside and an Order be granted dismissing the Plaintiffs' motion for judgement with costs.</P>
<P>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL are as follows:
<P1>a) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in piercing the corporate veil and affixing personal liability on the Appellants.</P1>
<P1>b) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the Appellants used 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED to engage in improper and dishonest conduct.</P1>
<P1>c) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that <UNDER>any of</UNDER> the Appellants <UNDER><STRIKE>or 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED</STRIKE></UNDER> had converted the Plaintiffs' assets to themselves.</P1>
<P1>d) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the Appellants had attempted to use the corporate entity to commit dishonest or improper acts.</P1>
<P1>e) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that improper acts on the part of a corporate entity are sufficient to affix personal liability on the corporate entity's directors and/or controlling minds.</P1>
<P1>f) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the Asset Purchase Agreement obliged 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED to assume responsibility for the leasehold improvement loan.</P1>
<P1>g) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding, on the evidence, that the Appellants cheated the Plaintiffs out of the assets of the business.</P1>
<P1>h) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the Appellant 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED was in breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement.</P1>
<P1>i) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the clawback of deferred rent was a foreseeable consequence of non-payment by the Appellant 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED of amounts pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.</P1>
<P1>j) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in his interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement.</P1>
<P1>k) There was absolutely no evidence upon which the learned Motions Court Judge could make a decision as to what was reasonably foreseeable with regard to payment of deferred rent.</P1>
<P1>l) There was absolutely no evidence upon which the learned Motions Court Judge could have made any finding as to what was in the contemplation of the Appellant 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED with regard to the deferred rent.</P1>
<P1>m) The learned Motions Court Judge erred in finding that the Plaintiffs reasonably settled the landlord's claim.</P1>
<P1>n) The learned Motions Court Judge erred, by reversing the onus of proof, in allowing the Plaintiffs' claim for costs it paid the landlord on the basis that he did not have a sufficient evidentiary record to persuade him that the costs were unreasonable.</P1>
<P1>o) Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:
<P1>a) The Judgment is a final order for payment of the sum of $58,697.06 <UNDER>by the Appellants Mike Allen and Clark Kent.</UNDER></P1>
<P1>b) <UNDER>The Judgment is a final order for payment of the sum of $85.637.97 by the Appellant 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED.</UNDER></P1>
<P1>c) The <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> 6(1) gives the Court of Appeal jurisdiction over a final order of a judge in the Superior Court of Justice. 19(1)(a) does not apply as the judgment is in excess of $50,000.00.</P1>
<P1>d) Leave to appeal is not required.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPELLANTS 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED, MIKE ALLEN and CLARK KENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;ORDERS APPEALED FROM</TI>
<P>1. This is an appeal by the Appellants, 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED, MIKE ALLEN and CLARK KENT, from Orders of Justice Boswell dated November 27<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 and March 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018 granting judgment in the amount of $85,637.97 against the Appellant 2487048 ONTARIO LIMITED and granting judgment in the amount of $58,697.06 against the Appellants MIKE ALLEN and CLARK KENT respectively.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;NATURE OF THE CASE</TI>
<P>2. This appeal stems from an action brought by the plaintiffs against the defendants arising out of an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby the corporate plaintiff sold certain assets and assigned contracts to the numbered company defendant.</P>
<P>3. The Statement of Claim was amended to, inter alia, include allegations of negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, conversion and deceit as against the individual defendants who, at all material times, were the directing minds of 2487048 Ontario Limited (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;248&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. The plaintiffs brought a motion for summary judgment against all defendants which was heard by the Honourable Justice Boswell on November 2<SUP>nd</SUP>, 2017. His Honour's decision was reserved.</P>
<P>5. His Honour delivered his reasons on November 27<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 and granted judgment against 248 in the amount of $85,637.97. However, notwithstanding the fact that all the issues including the allegations of negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, conversion and deceit were argued, Justice Boswell was not prepared to deal with the claim for personal judgement against Mike Allen and Clark Kent (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Allen and Kent&rdquo;) as, because of an apparent mix-up in the file which had been put before him, he was not aware of the Amended Statement of Claim. Justice Boswell's reasons were silent with regard to Orion Fitness Inc.</P>
<P>6. In broad terms Justice Boswell's decision against 248 was based on findings that:
<P1>a) 248 was obliged to assume two loans under the Asset Purchase Agreement including one attributable to leasehold improvements and one attributable to equipment; and</P1>
<P1>b) 248 was liable for damages consisting of amounts the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the Landlord which were triggered by 248's failure to make payments which His Honour found should have been made.</P1></P>
<P>7. Counsel agreed that His Honour should be made aware of the true state of the pleadings and advised him, by letter, accordingly.</P>
<P>8. Very brief supplementary submissions were made on March 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018. His Honour reserved judgment. Supplementary reasons were delivered on March 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018 granting judgement against the individual defendants. Once again, these reasons were silent as to Orion Fitness Inc.</P>
<P>9. An order was obtained on consent, in this Court, on May 10<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018 extending the time for service of the Notice of Appeal from Justice Boswell's first decision and granting leave for the delivery of an amended notice of appeal. To all intents and purposes, therefore, this would be an appeal from one order but for the mix-up regarding the state of the pleadings.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<P>10. The plaintiff, 1802248 Ontario Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;180&rdquo;) is a corporation duly incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario, which carried on business as an &ldquo;Anytime Fitness&rdquo; franchise in Bradford, Ontario.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Tatiana Johnson Sworn September 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Johnson Affidavit&rdquo;) paragraph 2, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 10, paragraph 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. The defendant 248 is a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario.</P>
<P>12. On or about October 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2015 180 and the Johnsons (as sellers) and 248 (as buyer) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit paragraphs 5 and 6, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 10, paragraphs 5 and 6.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. Closing was scheduled for November 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 2015. On that date 248 assumed operation of Anytime Fitness.</P>
<P>14. Allen and Kent were not parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement or Consent to Assignment of Lease referred to in the pleadings.</P>
<P>15. Allen and Kent, on behalf of 248, were concerned that the loans and leases being assumed were attributable to the business which they were purchasing and, specifically, that the loans were with respect to &ldquo;certain equipment being assumed&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Clark Kent sworn October 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Kent Affidavit&rdquo;) paragraph 7, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraph 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. Allen and Kent, on behalf of 248, consistently took the position that they were prepared to pay any amounts properly owing but only after the plaintiffs provided proof that the loans which the plaintiffs wanted to be paid were in conformity with the Asset Purchase Agreement. This did not happen until after the commencement of the action.
<P1><BOLD>Kent Affidavit paragraph 12, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraph 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. It is important to be borne in mind that the structure of the transaction was negotiated and finalized without involvement of lawyers.
<P1><BOLD>Kent Affidavit paragraph 5, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraph 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Eventually, and only months after the commencement of the action, the plaintiffs provided loan documentation with regard to the loans sought to be paid. This disclosed that there were originally two loans totalling $182,526.81. $91,800.00 of that loan facility was attributable to leasehold improvements and $90,726.81 was attributable to equipment. Of the approximate $58,000.00 referred to in the Asset Purchase Agreement, only $18,582.87 was attributable to equipment. The balance was attributable to leasehold improvements.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit paragraph 4, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 10, paragraph 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>LEASE DEFAULT</TI>
<P>19. It was agreed to by the parties that 180 would remit payment to the Landlord for the months of November and December and the defendants would pay for rent for the month of January.</P>
<P>20. The arrangements between 180 and 248 contemplated a Statement of Adjustments being prepared. What purported to be a Statement of Adjustments was prepared by the plaintiffs and provided to 248. This document purported to show that 248 owed the plaintiffs $14,941.04.</P>
<P><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit paragraphs 15 through 18 inclusive, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 10, paragraphs 15 through 18 inclusive.</BOLD></P>
<P>21. Clark Kent did not agree with the Statement of Adjustments. He had no idea what a Statement of Adjustments was. He told Tatiana Johnson that he wanted to review the document with his lawyer. He provided her with a post-dated cheque but advised her it should not be used until he reviewed it with his lawyer. He was advised that the adjustments were not justified under the agreement. Therefore the cheque was dishonoured.
<P1><BOLD>Kent Affidavit paragraph 13, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraph 13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. 248 was not prepared to pay any amounts to the plaintiffs unless and until it was provided reasonable proof that the loans were in conformity with the Asset Purchase Agreement, i.e. that they related to equipment loans and had been used for the purposes of the business.
<P1><BOLD>Kent Affidavit paragraph 12, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraph 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. It is the position of the plaintiffs that because 248 stopped payment on the cheque referred to in paragraph 20, they defaulted on their obligations to the Landlord pursuant the Assignment Agreement thus triggering obligations pursuant to a deferment agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit paragraphs 28 and 29, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 10, paragraphs 28 and 29.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. It is the position of the defendants that 248 was not in default of their obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement or with regard to the &ldquo;Statement of Adjustments&rdquo; as, at all material times, proof had not been provided that the loans to be assumed were equipment loans.</P>
<P>25. In any event, there is no evidence that any of the defendants was aware of the financial position of the plaintiffs or that the plaintiffs would not be in a position to meet their obligation to the Landlord without monies from the defendants.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>PERSONAL LIABILITY OF ALLEN AND KENT</TI>
<P>26. Allen and Kent were not parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Consent to Assignment of Lease.
<P1><BOLD>Kent Affidavit paragraphs 2 and 4, Appeal Book and Compendium of the Appellants Tab 12, paragraphs 2 and 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Allen and Kent are the directing minds of 248. There is no evidence that any of the defendants converted any property of the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>28. There is no evidence that either Allen or Kent made any negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations to the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>29. There is no evidence of any deceit on the part of Allen and Kent.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ISSUES AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>30. Rule 20.04(2) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> states:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The court shall grant summary judgment if</EM>,</P>
<P><EM>(a) the court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence; or</EM></P>
<P><EM>(b) the parties agree to have all or part of the claim determined by a summary judgment and the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to grant summary judgment</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, R.E.G 194</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. The leading case with regard to the test for summary judgment is <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>. If the summary judgment process:
<P1>(a) allows the court to make the necessary findings of fact</P1>
<P1>(b) allows the court to apply the law to the facts and</P1>
<P1>(c) is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result</P1>
there will be no genuine issue requiring a trial.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 S.C.C. 7</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>32. It is conceded that this was an appropriate case for a motion for summary judgment. However, shortly put, it is the Appellants' position that the learned motion's court judge erred in the findings he made.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>WHAT AMOUNT, IF ANY, IS OWING UNDER THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT?</TI>
<P>33. It is submitted that the wording of the Asset Purchase Agreement, with regard to the loans/leases to be assumed was clear, unambiguous and not in need of any interpretive process.</P>
<P>34. Surrounding circumstances may be considered in interpreting a contract if the wording is unclear, ambiguous or need of interpretation. However, the circumstances must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of the agreement or to deviate from the text so as to effectively create a new agreement.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sattva Capital Corp v. Creston Moly Corp</SOC><CITE>[2014] 2 SCR 633</CITE><PARANUM>57</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Sattva].</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Glaswegian Enterprises Inc. v. B.C. Tel Mobility Cellular Inc.</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>101 B. C.A.C. 62</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>35. The Asset Purchase Agreement is perfectly clear. The purchasers were to assume loans or leases with regard to certain equipment not with regard to leasehold improvements.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Veentis Inc. et al. v. Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust et al</SOC><YEAR>2007</YEAR><CITE>85 O.R. (3d) 254</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>36. In is reasons, the learned motions court judge referenced the Veentis Inc case.</P>
<P>37. While it is now clear that $18,582.87 was attributable to the equipment lease, this was not known to 248 until after the commencement of this action,. Therefore, at most, 248 would be indebted to the plaintiffs in the amount of $18,582.87 which is within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>248'S LIABILITY PURSUANT TO THE ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT</TI>
<P>38. It is the plaintiffs' position that 248 was in breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement and that 248's failure to pay amounts owing under the Asset Purchase Agreement caused the plaintiffs to be unable to pay rent to the Landlord thereby triggering additional rent payable under the deferment agreement.</P>
<P>39. Assuming that 248 was in default, which fact is not admitted for the reasons set out above, it is submitted that the amounts paid by the plaintiffs to the Landlord are not recoverable for the simple reason that they were not foreseeable.</P>
<P>40. The classic principles, verging on trite law, are set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Hadley v. Baxendale</SOC></CASEREF>. The learned motions court judge cited <CASEREF><SOC>Hadley v. Baxendale</SOC></CASEREF>. However, it is submitted that the erred insofar as the payment of the deferred rent neither arose naturally, according to the usual course of things, or would have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract. Therefore, it is submitted that the claim for this head of damages must fail.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hadley v. Baxendale</SOC><CITE>(1854) 9 Exch 341</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>DO THE PERSONAL DEFENDANTS HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY PART OF THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM?</TI>
<P>41. The starting point for an analysis of this issue is the proposition that a corporation has its own separate identity and the corporate veil protects the officers, directors and shareholders of the corporation from liability for the actions of the corporation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1897] A.C. 22</CITE><COURTJUR>H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>42. The case against individual defendants is based on allegations of negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, conversion and deceit. The cases in which the corporate veil has been breached, some of which are referred to by the learned motions court judge involve findings of fraud or the exercise of control for fraudulent or improper purposes.
<P1><BOLD><EM>642947 Ontario Ltd. Fleischer</EM>, 2001 CarswellOnt 4296, [2001] O.J. No. 4771.</BOLD></P1>

<P>43. It is submitted that in the case at bar, there is simply no evidence of Allen or Kent doing anything which could be reasonably construed or interpreted as fraudulent conduct. There is certainly no evidence of misrepresentations whether negligent or fraudulent on the part of Allen or Kent.</P>
<P>44. It is submitted that the Bhasin case while recognizing a principle good faith in informing contractual performance does not extend to the piercing the corporate veil in a case such as this. In any event the evidence in the case at bar does not support a finding that either Allen or Kent lied or knowingly misled any of the plaintiffs.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bhasin v. Hrynew</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 71</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>45. At its highest this is a case in which the corporate defendant, 248, did not pay pursuant to a contract. Every day of the week banks extend credit to corporations and require personal guarantees from the principals of the corporate borrower. It is submitted that if liability is imposed on Allen and Kent on the facts of this case, there will be no need for such personal guarantees in future.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART VI&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>46. The Appellants seek an order allowing the appeal, setting aside the orders of Justice Boswell dated November 27<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017 and March 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018 and substituting an order dismissing the action with costs of the appeal and below against 248 and Allen and Kent.</P>
<P>47. In the alternative, the Appellants seek an order dismissing the action, allowing the appeal, setting aside the order of Justice Boswell, dismissing the action as against Allen and Kent and substituting a judgment in the amount of $18,582.87 with costs payable by the plaintiffs here and below.</P>
<P>48. In the further alternative, the Appellants submit that if judgment is entered in the amount of $18,582.87 against 248 costs payable by 248 should be on the Small Claim Court scale and costs otherwise payable by the plaintiffs to Allen and Kent herein below.</P>
<P><BOLD>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED</BOLD> this 12<SUP>th</SUP> day of June, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE PLAINTIFFS (RESPONDENTS)</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW&mdash;NATURE OF CASE AND ISSUES</TI>
<P>1. This Respondents on Appeal entered into an agreement with the Appellants to sell them a fitness club business, including equipment, goodwill and their interest in leased premises. Upon closing, the Appellants took possession of the premises and business and realized the benefits of the business revenues thereafter. However, they didn't pay anything to the Respondents. Instead, they raised various unsubstantiated issues, stopped payment on their cheque without justification, and failed to pay even the portion of the purchase price that they did not dispute. Meanwhile, the Respondents remained liable to the landlord for the lease obligations and post closing accounts. This failure to pay the purchase price and adjusted expense put the Respondents in a precarious financial position such that they could not pay the rent for the business premises they had turned over to the Appellants. The landlord pursued the Respondents for arrears of rent that became due and owing and the Respondents paid the landlords' claim. The Appellants occupied the space and operated the business but didn't contribute to the landlords' claim. The Respondents commenced the present claim and obtained judgment against the Appellants on a summary judgment motion before the Honourable Justice Boswell. It is the Respondents' submission that Justice Boswell properly considered the applicable summary judgment rules, the caselaw and the evidence, and did not commit any error upon which this appeal could be based.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>2. The Respondents accept as correct the facts listed in the Appellants Factum at paragraph numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, and 26.</P>
<P>3. The Respondents disagree with the facts listed in the Appellants Factum at paragraph numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28 and 29.</P>
<P>4. The Respondents raise the following additional facts: The Respondents, Tatiana Johnson (&ldquo;Tatiana&rdquo;) and Ryan Johnson (&ldquo;Ryan&rdquo;), incorporated 1802248 Ontario Ltd. (&ldquo;180&rdquo;) in 2009 to carry on business as an &ldquo;Anytime Fitness&rdquo; franchise in Bradford, Ontario (&ldquo;Anytime Fitness&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Tatiana Johnson sworn September 6, 2016, (&ldquo;Affidavit No. 1&rdquo;) Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 1, paragraph 2, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; at pages 16&ndash;22.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. 180 and the Johnsons entered into a Lease Agreement dated January 15, 2010 (the &ldquo;Lease&rdquo;) to lease premises for the fitness club within the Bradford East Shopping Centre in Bradford, Ontario. The term of the Lease was for 10 years, 3 months and 6 days, commencing on March 26, 2010 and expiring on June 30, 2020. Ryan and Tatiana provided their personal guarantees and indemnities of 180's lease obligations.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 2, paragraph 3, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; at pages 23&ndash;84.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. 180 obtained a Scotiabank Small Business Loan in the amount of $182,526.81 (the &ldquo;Business Loan&rdquo;). The loan secured $91,800.00 for leasehold improvements s and $90,726.81 for equipment. As at October 31, 2015, the total outstanding loan amounts were $40,114.19 for leasehold improvements and $18,582.87 for equipment, with the total amount due and payable being $58,697.06. This loan was secured as evidenced by a PPSA registration and was used for the purposes of operating the business.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 2, paragraph 4, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; at pages 85&ndash;89.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Sale of Anytime Fitness</TI>
<P>7. Ryan and Tatiana decided to sell Anytime Fitness after operating it for almost 6 years. On or around October 1, 2015, the Appellants Mike Allen and Clark Kent approached Ryan and Tatiana and expressed interest in purchasing the business. The parties executed an Asset Purchase Agreement on October 31, 2015, with the purchaser being 2487048 Ontario Limited (&ldquo;248&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 2, paragraph 5, Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; at pages 90&ndash;105.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. Article 3 of the Asset Purchase Agreement sets out the purchase price and payment for Anytime Fitness as follows:
<P1>A. <BOLD>Purchase Price:</BOLD> The purchase price for the Assets and the Assigned Contracts as well, (&ldquo;Purchase Price&rdquo;) shall be (i) the sum of $1.00 plus (ii) the total of 2 loans/lease with respect to certain Equipment being assumed by the Buyer in the amount of approximately Fifty Eight Thousand Dollars ($58,000.00), with the exact amount to be determined by a current statement to be provided by the Seller at the Time of Closing. The purchase price shall be paid as follows:
<P2>(i) the sum of $ 1.00 shall be paid on closing;</P2>
<P2>(ii) the balance of the purchase price shall be paid by way of a promissory note, which promissory note will reflect the loan/lease payments being assumed. The payment of the monthly payments under the promissory note may be made to the seller or alternatively to the lender/lessor in the sole discretion of the Buyer.</P2></P1>
<P1>B. <BOLD>Inventory</BOLD>: The Purchase Price herein described shall include incidental, current inventory approved by Anytime Fitness, LLC including but not limited to key fobs, blank membership forms, cleaning &amp; office supplies, branded products and accessories.</P1>
<P1>C. <BOLD>Franchisor and Franchise Fee</BOLD>: In connection with the Purchase Price Buyer agrees to pay the Franchise Transfer Fee, herein defined and further to complete the application process and to provide all related materials required by Franchisor to secure the Franchise Agreement. The Franchise is governed by the Franchisor with a corporate headquarters at 1281 Margo Avenue South, Hastings, MN 5503. The Franchisor's transfer fee associated with this Agreement is $2,500.00.</P1>
<P1>D. <BOLD>Real Estate Lease Assumption</BOLD>: This agreement of purchase and sale is specifically conditional upon the Buyer assuming the existing lease or entering into a new lease with the landlord on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Buyer in its sole and unfettered discretion.</P1></P>
<P>9. Closing was scheduled for November 1, 2015. On that date, the Appellants assumed operations of Anytime Fitness and profited from any and all revenues generated from the business thereafter. Possession of the purchased assets was delivered on that date, and Ryan and Tatiana had no further involvement in running the business. However, 180, Ryan and Tatiana had yet to assign the Lease to the Appellants and were still obligated for any and all loan payments, rent payments and other miscellaneous costs associated with the operation of Anytime Fitness. Ryan and Tatiana believed that the parties intended that it would be reflected within a Statement of Adjustments, which would be provided to the Appellants upon the assignment of the Lease by the Landlord, Great Gulf (Churchill) Ltd. (the &ldquo;Landlord&rdquo;) to the Appellants.

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Assignment and Assumption Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>10. On or around November 12, 2015, 180, 248, Orion Fitness Inc. (&ldquo;Orion&rdquo;), Ryan and Tatiana entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Consent to Assignment of Lease (the &ldquo;Assignment Agreement&rdquo;) with the Landlord. The individual Appellants, Mike Allen and Clark Kent, are the sole officers and directors of Orion.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 4, paragraph 9, Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; at pages 106&ndash;121.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Orion agreed to indemnify the Landlord on a joint and several basis in respect of any non-observance or non-performance of the Lease Terms. Further, pursuant to section 8 of the Assignment Agreement, Orion also agreed to indemnify, without limitation, any nonobservance or non-performance and any non-payment of the amounts referred to in sections 9(e) and (f).</P>
<P>12. According to the Assignment Agreement, the Landlord agreed to provide Orion with 3 months of free rent commencing November 1, 2015 and ending on January 31, 2016. During that time, no Minimum Rent or Additional Rent was payable by Orion so long as the parties complied with section 9(e) of the Assignment Agreement. Orion agreed to indemnify the Landlord, without limitation, in respect of any non-payment to the Landlord of the amounts that became repayable as a result of default of section 9(e).</P>
<P>13. It was agreed by the parties that 180 would remit payment to the Landlord for the months of November and December and the Appellants would pay rent for the month of January. It was Ryan and Tatiana's understanding that this would allow the Appellants sufficient time to get established in the business and generate revenue so as to be able to satisfy its obligations. It was their further understanding that this was to be reflected in the Statement of Adjustments which was provided to the Appellants following the execution of the Assignment Agreement. As such, 180, Ryan and Tatiana provided the Landlord with post-dated cheques, two of which were honoured, but Ryan and Tatiana were forced to issue a stop payment on the third cheque for the reasons as described below.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Statement of Adjustments</EM></TI>
<P>14. On November 23, 2015 Ryan and Tatiana provided the Appellants with the Statement of Adjustments. The Statement of Adjustments was revised several times as Ryan and Tatiana continued to incur expenses with respect to the carrying costs of Anytime Fitness despite Ryan and Tatiana having turned over the business operations to the Appellants as of November 1, 2015.</P>
<P>15. On December 8, 2015 Ryan and Tatiana provided the Appellants with their final Statement of Adjustments. The final Statement of Adjustments considered the costs of operating the business during which time Ryan and Tatiana no longer had the benefit of a source of revenue from Anytime Fitness, in addition to the rent deposit.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 6, paragraph 16, Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; at pages 122&ndash;125.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. As per the Statement of Adjustments, Ryan and Tatiana calculated that the Appellants owed them $14,941.04 in addition to the Purchase Price. 248 issued a cheque to 180 in this amount dated December 31, 2015 (the &ldquo;Cheque&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 6, paragraph 17, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; at pages 126&ndash;128.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. However, the Appellants requested that Ryan and Tatiana not deposit the Cheque until they provided proof of the existence of the secured loan from Scotiabank. On December 30, 2016, after the Appellants were already operating the business, Ryan forwarded Mike Allen and Clark Kent a discharge letter from Scotiabank regarding the PPSA release. Mike Allen and Clark Kent further requested a letter from Ryan and Tatiana's bank confirming the outstanding loan amounts at the time of closing. This was provided to the Appellants on January 14, 2016.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Promissory Note</EM></TI>
<P>18. Article 3(A) (ii) provided that the Appellants would have the option to choose to pay off the Business Loan to Ryan and Tatiana or directly to Scotiabank. Following closing, the parties were advised by Scotiabank that it would not permit 180 to assign the Business Loan to the Appellants. Therefore, on November 7, 2015, Ryan and Tatiana provided Mike Allen and Clark Kent with a loan amortization schedule to finalize a promissory note in favour of 180, directly to the bank. It was Tatiana's belief that the Appellants took no issue with 180 paying the loan, and they did so, to retire the indebtedness to Scotiabank and replace it with a loan payable by the Appellants to 180.</P>
<P>19. However, after Ryan and Tatiana made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain a copy of the Promissory Note from the Appellants and/or their lawyer, after having paid off the bank loans for the benefit of the Appellants.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 7, paragraph 20, Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; at pages 129&ndash;133.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. The Appellants would not agree to the terms of a Promissory Note stating that Ryan and Tatiana were unable, at that time, to provide them with proof that the Business Loan was a debt of 180 and not a personal debt, and that the Business Loan had been paid off. However, the Scotiabank security was discharged on or around December 30, 2015 and this discharge was provided on the same day to the Appellants by way of email correspondence. The original copies were provided to the Appellants shortly thereafter on January 11, 2016.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, pages 7-8, paragraph 22, Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; at pages 134&ndash;138.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Purchase Price Default</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Failing to Pay the Purchase Price</EM></TI>
<P>21. Despite Ryan and Tatiana providing proof to the Appellants that (a) the Business Loan was for the purposes of operating 180 and Anytime Fitness; and (b) that they had paid the Business Loan and provided proof thereof, the Appellants refused to make the payment pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and Promissory Note. The Appellants continued to operate the business without providing any payment. The Appellants instead took the position that they are not liable to Ryan and Tatiana because they never provided them with proof that the loans were for the purposes of operating Anytime Fitness and that Ryan and Tatiana paying the loans to the bank themselves was in breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Stop-Payment</EM></TI>
<P>22. The Appellants issued the Cheque with respect to the amount due and owing to Ryan and Tatiana pursuant to the Statement of Adjustments. When Ryan and Tatiana attempted to deposit the Cheque, the issuing bank did not honour it. The Cheque was returned on January 12, 2016 with no reason provided to Ryan and Tatiana from the Appellants as to why they placed the stop payment on the Cheque.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 9, paragraph 26, Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; at pages 139&ndash;143.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. On Friday, January 15, 2016, Tatiana drove to Anytime Fitness to meet with Clark Kent and to discuss why he placed a stop payment on the cheque. During this meeting he acknowledged the fact that the Appellants owed Ryan and Tatiana money but indicated that he did not want to pay until they had an executed Promissory Note. When Tatiana pressed him to explain why they had not signed the Promissory Note that they had provided eight weeks earlier, he explained that it was difficult to get it signed over the holidays and that their lawyer at the time was slow at getting back to them.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 9, paragraph 27, Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; at pages 144-145.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Lease Default</TI>
<P>24. As a result of the Appellants' failure to pay for the business, and as a direct consequence of them stopping payment on the Cheque, Ryan and Tatiana defaulted on their obligations to the Landlord pursuant to the Assignment Agreement.</P>
<P>25. This was of critical concern to Ryan and Tatiana given their obligations pursuant to a Deferment Agreement that they had entered into with the Landlord dated March 19, 2015, which forgave and deferred a portion of rent as long as the rent that was owed remained in good standing. Paragraph 6 of the Deferment Agreement states that if there is a default in payment of the deferred monies prior to March 20, 2016, the deferred amount shall become due and payable. Therefore, as a result of the Appellants' stopping payment on the Cheque and failure to pay the Purchase Price, Ryan and Tatiana defaulted on the Deferment Agreement thus causing the Landlord to additionally claim the deferred amount of rent from them.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, pages 9-10, paragraph 29, Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo; at pages 146&ndash;150.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. On February 8, 2016, there were arrears of rent owing to the Landlord in relation to the Lease, Assignment Agreement and Deferment Agreement in the amount of $37,273.00, with respect to the rent due and owing for the months of November and December 2015, as well as January and February 2016. If the Appellants had not placed a stop payment on the Cheque and paid for the business, the Lease, Deferment Agreement and the Assignment Agreement would have remained in good standing and it ought to have been within the reasonable contemplation that Ryan and Tatiana would be liable for the full amount as claimed by the Landlord.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Landlord's Action</TI>
<P>27. As a result of the default on the Lease, the Landlord commenced an action against Tatiana, Ryan and 180 (&ldquo;the Landlord's Action&rdquo;).
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 12, paragraph 38, Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo; at pages 161&ndash;166.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. In an effort to mitigate damages and to avoid incurring additional legal fees, Ryan and Tatiana consented to judgment with the Landlord with a forbearance period lasting until September 21, 2016 so that they could pursue a claim against the Appellants for the Purchase Price under the Asset Purchase Agreement. This was done without prejudice to Ryan and Tatiana rights to claim against the Appellants for their default under the Assignment Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 12, paragraph 39, Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo; at pages 167&ndash;170.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Asset Purchase Agreement Action</TI>
<P>29. On June 6, 2016 Ryan and Tatiana commenced this action against 248, Allen, Kent and Orion. In the claim, they sought contribution and indemnity for the Landlord's claim and damages with respect to the Asset Purchase Agreement.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, page 12, paragraph 40, Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo; at pages 171&ndash;179.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. 248, Allen, Kent and Orion defended the action and denied liability on the basis that Ryan and Tatiana failed to provide them with proof that the loans were for the purposes of operating 180 and Anytime Fitness and that they failed to provide them with proof of the PPSA discharge. It is Tatiana's belief that the Financing Change Statement they provided clearly indicated that the loan named the debtor as being 180, the business, and not Ryan and Tatiana personally as it was a business loan. The documents were provided to the Appellants promptly upon their request and as soon as they were made available to Ryan and Tatiana. The Appellants also did not deny the fact that they owed Ryan and Tatiana compensation with respect to the business.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 1, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 1, pages 12-13, paragraph 41, Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo; at pages 180&ndash;183.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. In further satisfaction of the Appellants request for evidence of loan documentation, a copy of Loan Registration Form submitted to Industry Canada as part of its Canada Small Business Financing Program was provided.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 2, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 2, page 185 paragraph 5 Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; at pages 214&ndash;221.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>32. It was necessary for Ryan and Tatiana to make certain leasehold improvements to the Property so that they were able to operate Anytime Fitness&mdash;Bradford. Ryan and Tatiana used the Leasehold Loan to make the leasehold improvements to convert the unit into a gym facility.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 2, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 2, page 185, paragraph 7 Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; at pages 225&ndash;247.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>33. In this action, the Appellants were disputing the Plaintiffs entitlement to the funds owed on the basis that their interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement attributes the purchase price to only the equipment loans and not for any leasehold improvements. At the time of closing on November 1, 2015 there two loans, with $40,114.19 outstanding with respect to the leasehold loan, and $18,582.87 outstanding with respect to the equipment loan.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Tatiana Johnson sworn October 18 2016, (&ldquo;Johnson Affidavit No. 3&rdquo;) Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 3, page 248&mdash;paragraph 3 Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; at pages 251-252.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. Tatiana believed that the Appellants were fully aware and agreed to the sum of two loans, of approximately $58,000.00, prior to the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Appellants requested information from Ryan and Tatiana about the two loans and Ryan and Tatiana advised them by way of email correspondence dated October 1, 2015 that the loans were for both equipment and leasehold improvements.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 3, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 3, page 249, paragraph 4 Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; at pages 253-254.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. The Appellants did not raise any objection until the commencement of these proceedings with respect to the assumption of the two loans. In fact, Ryan and Tatiana were unaware that the Appellants were disputing their entitlement to repayment with respect to the leasehold improvement loan until they received the Appellants' affidavit sworn October 24, 2016.</P>
<P>36. Contrary to the Appellants' repeated assertions that this agreement was entered into without the benefit of legal counsel, it is Tatiana's belief that the Appellants did in fact receive legal advice prior to signing the Asset Purchase Agreement. In an email dated October 15, 2015, Ms. Flanders, who as with the Anytime Fitness Franchisor, advised Ryan and Tatiana that Clark Kent had given the Asset Purchase Agreement to his lawyer to make changes. Further, on October 27, 2015 Clark Kent emailed Ryan Johnson with a draft copy of the Purchase Agreement. In the email Kent states the following:
<QUOTE><P>Attached is the PA draft. Mike and I made a few changes to the agreement today from the original draft that our layer sent us today. Subject to our lawyers advice, this is essentially the offer.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>As a result of this email, Tatiana understood that the Appellants had received legal advice and were aware of all the contractual terms and obligations. Even upon receiving legal advice, the Appellants raised no issue with respect to the purchase price, specifically regarding the assumption of the two loans as disclosed to them on October 1, 2015.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 4, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 4, page 256, paragraph 5 Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; at pages 267-268.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. Following the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Tatiana provided Mike Allen, with an online print out from Scotiabank with the two loan balances. On December 30, 2015, Ryan emailed the Appellants with a copy of the discharge statement provided by the Bank of Nova Scotia along with a letter from the Bank of Nova Scotia indicating that the loans had been paid.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 4, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 4, page 257, paragraph 7 Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; at pages 269-270.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. In response to the Appellants requests for particulars of the loans in January of 2016, Ryan responded to advise the Appellants that this information was provided on November 1, 2015 with hard copies provided to Mike Allen. By way of email dated January 11, 2016, Tatiana offered to request confirmation of this information from the Bank of Nova Scotia. It was once again their belief that this satisfied any disclosure obligations they had as vendors and the Appellants would correspondingly present and execute a promissory note.
<P1><BOLD>Johnson Affidavit No. 4, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 4, page 258, paragraph 11 Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; at pages 278-279.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. On January 13, 2016, Ryan corresponded to the Appellants to advise that they had been in contact with Scotiabank and that a letter confirming the loan balances as of November 1, 2015 would be forthcoming. Ryan and Tatiana provide this letter from the bank on January 14, 2016, and still were not paid.
<P1>Johnson Affidavit No. 4, Compendium of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), Tab 4, pages 258-259, paragraph 13 Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; at pages 282-283.</P1></P>
<P>40. Ryan and Tatiana did not hear back from the Appellants about their request for a signed Promissory Note nor did they receive a payment for the Anytime Fitness Franchise pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. On January 29, 2016, Ryan wrote to Clark Kent and Mike Allen and requested either an executed copy of the Promissory Note or a settlement for the Statement of Adjustments. Ryan and Tatiana did not receive a response to indicate that the reason the Appellants were denying payment because of insufficient financial disclosure. It was not until the Appellants' filed their Statement of Defence in this matter that Ryan and Tatiana were aware that they were challenging the sufficiency of their disclosure and relying on it as a basis to not remit payment for the purchase of the Anytime Fitness Franchise.</P>
<P>41. As of the date of the summary judgment motion, the Appellants had not paid anything to the Respondents for the business they began operating in November of 2016.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;POSITION ON ISSUES</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Standard of Review</EM></TI>
<P>42. Absent an error of law, the exercise of powers under the new summary judgment rule attracts deference. When the motion judge exercises her new fact finding powers under Rule 20.04(2) and determines whether there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, this is a question of mixed fact and law. Where there is no extricable error in principle, findings of mixed fact and law should not be overturned absent palpable and overriding error.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>(2014) 1 SCC 7 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>81 and 82</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>43. A purpose of the distinction drawn in the jurisprudence between questions of mixed fact and law and questions of law supports, as a matter of judicial economy, a limit on the ability of an appellate court to interfere with the fact finder's interpretation of a contract, given that in most cases the interpretation will have no impact beyond the interests of the parties to the particular dispute. To hold otherwise would only serve to stir up unnecessary litigation by permitting the parties to relitigate their disputes on appeal.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Chicago Title Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>(2015) ONCA 842 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>17, 20 and 21</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>44. The Appellant's Factum acknowledges at paragraphs 31 and 32 that the present case is an appropriate case for a motion for summary judgment. This Appeal does not appear to be based on the submission that the motions Judge erred in exercising his discretion to determine that there was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The Appellants' position is that the learned motions Judge erred in the findings that he made having exercised the fact finding powers granted under rule 20.04 (2.1). As such, the Respondents submit that the motions Judge's findings are entitled to deference. They submit that there was no extricable error in principle or palpable and overriding error of fact the court below. The Respondents submit that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings made by the motions Judge.</P>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N><EM>#1:</EM></N><TI><EM>What Amount, if Any, Is Owing Under the Asset Purchase Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>45. The Respondents disagree with the Appellants' submission that the Asset Purchase Agreement is perfectly clear and that the motion Judge erred in considering the surrounding circumstances as an interpretive tool. The motions Judge's approach was consistent with the principles stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Molly Corp</SOC></CASEREF> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>While the surrounding circumstances will be considered in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement (<EM>Hayes Forest Services</EM>, at para. 14; and Hall, at p. 30). The goal of examining such evidence is to deepen a decision-maker's understanding of the mutual and objective intentions of the parties as expressed in the words of the contract. The interpretation of a written contractual provision must always be grounded in the text and read in light of the entire contract (Hall, at pp. 15 and 30&ndash;32). While the surrounding circumstances are relied upon in the interpretive process, courts cannot use them to deviate from the text such that the court effectively creates a new agreement (<CASEREF><SOC>Glaswegian Enterprises Inc. v. B. C. Tel Mobility Cellular Inc.</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>1997 CanLII 4085</CITE><COURTJUR>BC CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>101 B.C.A.C. 62</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>).</P></QUOTE>

<P>46. The Respondents submit that the motions Judge did not err in finding that the Asset Purchase Agreement contained an ambiguity requiring consideration of the surrounding circumstances. The purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement is stated to be equivalent to the total of 2 loans / lease with respect to certain equipment, with a cumulative amount of $58,000.00. There were two loans in existence that had a combined balance of approximately $58,000.00, one of which was in relation to leasehold improvements. The stated value of the loans accorded with the leasehold loan being included in the price although the Asset Purchase Agreement did not make specific reference to leasehold improvements. The Respondents submit that the Asset Purchase Agreement was not perfectly clear that the purchase price excluded the leasehold improvement loan, and in fact, that interpretation ignores the commercial reality of the transaction. Notably, paragraph 35 of the Appellants' Factum submits that the Asset Purchase Agreement was perfectly clear but uses language that is different from the Asset Purchase Agreement in order to be clear. The Asset Purchase Agreement did not use the language &ldquo;loans or leases with regard to certain equipment <BOLD>not</BOLD> with regard to leasehold improvements&rdquo; which is found in the Appellants' factum. The respondents submit that the motions judge appropriately held that the surrounding circumstances could be considered and did so without error. His Honour then considered the purpose of the transaction being to transfer the entire business and leased premises, the stated purchase price and the fact that the Respondents confirmed by email that one of the loans was for leasehold improvements prior to closing. The Respondents submit that the motions Judge's findings are supportable on the evidence and do not contain a palpable and overriding error.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N><EM>#2:</EM></N><TI><EM>Liability Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>47. The Respondents submit that the motions judge did not err in finding the Appellants liable for the deferred rent that was triggered by the default under the Lease Agreement and the Deferment Agreement. The motions judge appropriately considered the principle of reasonable foreseeability as outlined in <CASEREF><SOC>Hadley v. Baxendale</SOC></CASEREF>, relied upon by the Appellants. Boswell J. found that the Appellants were aware of the Deferment Agreement and the consequences of default under the Lease being the obligation to pay deferred rent. There was sufficient evidence for him to find that it was reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances that taking over the Anytime Fitness business while paying nothing to the Respondents would cause a default under the Lease that related to premises that was no longer occupied by the Respondents. The Respondents submit that the motions judge did not commit an appealable error in making this finding.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4 LABEL="Issue"><N><EM>#3:</EM></N><TI><EM>Do the Personal Appellants Have Liability for Any Part of the Plaintiffs' Claims?</EM></TI>
<P>48. The tort of conversion involves a wrongful interference with the goods of another, such as taking, using or destroying these goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner's right of possession. The tort is one of strict liability, and accordingly, it is no defence that the wrongful act was committed in all innocence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Boma Manufacturing Boma Manufacturing Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</SOC><CITE>1996 CanLII SCC 149</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>49. The motions judge held that the Appellants had committed the tort of conversion by taking the Johnsons' fitness business and failing or refusing to pay them anything for it. He found that the Appellants had done so, even though they acknowledged that a portion of the purchase price was undisputed by them, but still was not paid. He further found that the Appellants had provided a cheque in accordance with the Statement of Adjustments, but stopped payment on it, suggesting only that their lawyer advised them to do so, but providing no particulars as to this reasoning or advice or identifying that lawyer. The Appellants did not request any amendments to the Statement of Adjustments, or raise any issue, but rather continued operating the business without any payment. Based on the evidence Boswell J. held that the Appellants did not intend to pay the Responds. The Respondents submit that the motions Judge did not err in finding that these facts satisfied the elements of the tort of conversion.</P>
<P>50. The motions judge further held that the Appellants had breached their obligations to perform their contractual duties in good faith as outlined in <CASEREF><SOC>Bhasin v. Hrynew</SOC></CASEREF> as follows:
<QUOTE><P>As the Court has recognized, an organizing principle states in general terms a requirement of justice from which more specific legal doctrines may be derived. An organizing principle therefore is not a free-standing rule, but rather a standard that underpins and is manifested in more specific legal doctrines and may be given different weight in different situations....</P>
<P>[65] The organizing principle of good faith exemplifies the notion that, in carrying out his or her own performance of the contract, a contracting party should have appropriate regard to the legitimate contractual interests of the contracting partner. While &ldquo;appropriate regard&rdquo; for the other party's interests will vary depending on the context of the contractual relationship, it does not require acting to serve those interests in all cases. It merely requires that a party not seek to undermine those interests in bad faith. This general principle has strong conceptual differences from the much higher obligations of a fiduciary. Unlike fiduciary duties, good faith performance does not engage duties of loyalty to the other contracting party or a duty to put the interests of the other contracting party first.</P>
<P>[66] This organizing principle of good faith manifests itself through the existing doctrines about the types of situations and relationships in which the law requires, in certain respects, honest, candid, forthright or reasonable contractual performance. Generally, claims of good faith will not succeed if they do not fall within these existing doctrines. But we should also recognize that this list is not closed. The application of the organizing principle of good faith to particular situations should be developed where the existing law is found to be wanting and where the development may occur incrementally in a way that is consistent with the structure of the common law of contract and gives due weight to the importance of private ordering and certainty in commercial affairs.</P></QUOTE>

<P>51. The Respondents submit that the motions judge correctly considered the principles outlined in <EM>Bhasin</EM> as an organizing principle, in the context of the Appellants' claim for conversion, breach of contract and personal liability.</P>
<P>52. Justice Boswell, having found that the Appellants engaged in improper conduct and breached their duties of good faith in contractual performance, by taking the business without intending to pay for it, granted judgment against the individual Appellants. In <CASEREF><SOC>Transamerica Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Sharpe stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The courts will disregard the separate legal personality of a corporate entity where it is completely dominated and controlled and being used as a shield for fraudulent or improper conduct. The first element &ldquo;complete control&rdquo; required more than ownership.

<P>53. Justice Boswell, found that Clark Kent and Mike Allen were the controlling minds of 248, and pierced the corporate veil on the basis that they had engaged in improper conduct such that it would be flagrantly unjust to allow them to be shielded by the corporate entity. The Respondents submit that there was sufficient evidence for Justice Boswell to make these findings without appealable error. The Appellants had taken possession of all of the fitness equipment, the premises and the leasehold improvements. They then took the position that they were not obligated to pay alleging that the loans were personal loans. Later they claimed their client didn't have to pay for leasehold improvements despite the disclosure and particulars of the two loans that had been provided. Further, while they acknowledged the indebtedness for a portion of the purchase price at least in the amount of the cheque they provided for the Statement of Adjustment amount, and did not dispute to obligation to pay one business loan, they stopped payment on that cheque without meaningful explanation. The Appellants repeatedly invented purported reason not to pay anything for the business they had purchased and were operating, and were unable to provide evidence that their issues were legitimate. The Respondents submit that the Honourable Motions Judge considered this evidence and properly held that they Appellants did not intend to pay the purchase price and that it would be flagrantly unjust to allow them to avoid liability through a corporation. The Respondents submit that Justice Boswell did not commit an extricable error in principle or palpable and overriding error of fact.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">AFFIDAVIT OF DIANA JARVIS</TI>
<P>I, Diana Jarvis, of the Town of Whitby in the Regional Municipality of Durham, Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am assistant to Edward G. Spong, lawyer for the Defendant/Appellant 2487048 Ontario Limited herein.</P>
<P>2. I have reviewed this file and have also personally worked on this file from time to time and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to. Where I do not have personal knowledge of the matters deposed to, I have stated the course of my information, and I verily believe such information to be true.</P>
<P>3. The background of this matter is somewhat unusual.</P>
<P>4. The Plaintiffs/Respondents brought a motion for summary judgment which, after being adjourned from time to time, was ultimately argued on November 2, 2017 in Barrie.</P>
<P>5. In the motion the Plaintiffs/Respondents sought judgment against all the Defendants.</P>
<P>6. The motions court judge, Justice Boswell, reserved judgment.</P>
<P>7. On or about November 27, 2017 Justice Boswell's Reasons were received in our office via e-mail. Justice Boswell granted judgment against 2487048 Ontario Limited but declined to give judgment against Mike Allen or Clark Kent on the basis that the grounds argued by the Plaintiffs/Respondents namely conviction and misrepresentation were not pleaded.</P>
<P>8. In fact, the grounds referred to in the preceding paragraph had been pleaded in an Amended Statement of Claim which Plaintiffs' counsel, through inadvertence, had not included in the Motion Record.</P>
<P>9. Mr. Spong and Mr. Valler [counsel for the Plaintiffs] consulted with one another as to how to properly and best address this issue. They agreed to write to Justice Boswell and advise him of the true state of the pleadings prior to taking out the formal Orders. I am advised by Mr. Spong and do verily believe, that it was his view that, until the formal Order was issued and entered, Justice Boswell was not <EM>functus officio</EM>.</P>
<P>10. As a result of the letter which was sent to Justice Boswell the matter was brought back before him in Newmarket on March 6, 2018. On March 7, 2018, Justice Boswell granted judgment against Mike Allen and Clark Kent. No order has been made against the Defendant Orion Fitness Inc.</P>
<P>11. Mr. Valler attempted to take out one Order incorporating the judgment, set out in the Justice Boswell's Reasons dated November 27, 2017 and the order made by Justice Boswell on March 7, 2018. However, the court staff advised Mr. Valler that it would be necessary to take out two Orders, one dated November 27, 2017 and one dated March 7, 2018. This has now been done.</P>
<P>12. Clark Kent, Mike Allen and 2487048 Ontario Limited all wish to appeal Justice Boswell's orders. To that end, Clark Kent and Mike Allen delivered a Notice of Appeal dated April 4, 2018. Now attached to this my Affidavit and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; are true copies of the Notice of Appeal and my Affidavit of Service, sworn April 11, 2018. 2487048 Ontario Limited also delivered a Notice of Appeal dated April 4, 2018. Now attached to this my Affidavit and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; are true copies of the Notice of Appeal and my Affidavit of Service dated April 11, 2018.</P>
<P>13. The Notice of Appeal of the Defendants/Appellants, Clark Kent and Mike Allan, has been filed.</P>
<P>14. Mr. Spong advises me and I do verily believe, that upon reflection, he realizes that the appropriate process was for the two formal Orders to be taken out. However, he did not direct his mind to that issue when he realized Justice Bowell was not aware of the amended pleading but, rather, concentrated his efforts on correcting that situation.</P>
<P>15. As mentioned in paragraph 12 the Defendant/Appellant 2487048 Ontario Limited does wish to proceed with the appeal. A review of the Notices of Appeal discloses that the issues in the proposed appeal of 2487048 Ontario Limited overlap with the issues raised in the appeal of Clark Kent and Mike Allen.</P>
<P>16. I am advised by Mr. Spong and do verily believe, that if the Defendant/Appellant 2487048 Ontario Limited is not allowed to proceed with its appeal and Clark Kent and Mike Allen are successful there could be, in the end result, inconsistent judgments.</P>
<P>17. Mr. Spong advised Mr. Valler of 2487048 Ontario Limited's intention to appeal by letter dated April 5, 2018. Now attached to this my Affidavit and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; is a true copy of the redacted letter.</P>
<P>18. This Affidavit is made in support of a motion for an order extending the time for the Defendant/Appellant 2487048 Ontario Limited to file its Notice of Appeal and for no improper purpose.</P>
