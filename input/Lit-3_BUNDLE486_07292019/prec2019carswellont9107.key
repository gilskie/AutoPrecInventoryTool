<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT/DEFENDANT 3395052 CANADA INC.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>At the opening of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that the claim was being asserted only against Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation. See Reasons for Judgment at paragraph 12, last sentence.</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <BOLD>O/A KUTCHER DENTISTRY PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION APPEALS</BOLD> to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Chiappetta, dated May 25, 2018 (&ldquo;the Judgment&rdquo;), made at Toronto.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the Judgment be set aside and that
<P1>(a) the action be dismissed with costs of the action and of the appeal payable forthwith to the Appellant/Defendant in an amount to be fixed by this Honourable Court or following assessment, or</P1>
<P1>(b) in the alternative, the Judgment be varied as may be required by the findings of this Honourable Court on appeal with the costs of the appeal payable to the Appellant/Defendant and, to the extent warranted, the costs of the action varied accordingly; and</P1>
<P1>(c) granting leave to appeal the costs of the action awarded by the Learned Trial Judge and varying the costs award to the extent that this Honourable Court deems appropriate.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Judgment is wrong in fact and law and the Learned Trial Judge made one or more palpable and overriding error(s);</P>
<P>2. The Judgment is against the evidence tendered by the parties at trial;</P>
<P>3. The Learned Trial Judge erred in fact and in law in failing to properly analyze and apply the evidence and the submissions of the Appellant/Defendant and therefore made an incorrect assessment of credibility;</P>
<P>4. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in assessing the evidence and submissions on the issue of mitigation;</P>
<P>5. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in assessing the legal significance and effect of the Respondent's/Plaintiff's resignation on March 28, 2005, effective July 7, 2005, and of the offer of a new employment contract to her by 3395022 Canada Inc.;</P>
<P>6. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law and in fact in assessing and applying the evidence regarding the formal termination of the Respondent's/Plaintiff's employment, on October 1, 2011, to be effective December 31, 2011, by the 3395052 Canada Inc. and the offer of a new employment contract to her by the defendant Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation;</P>
<P>7. The Learned Trial Judge erred in the calculation of the Respondent's/Plaintiff's damages;</P>
<P>8. The Learned Trial Judge erred in awarding costs on the basis and in the amount she did following trial; and</P>
<P>9. Such further or other grounds as counsel shall advise and This Honourable Court permits.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD> s. 6(1) (b) of the <BOLD><EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM></BOLD>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 as amended. The Judgment is a final order of the Superior Court of Justice for an amount in excess of $50,000.00, exclusive of costs, and leave to appeal the Judgment is not required.</P>

<P>[1] The trial of this action took place before me over the course of less than two days. The plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $69,091.12. The plaintiff now seeks her costs of the action in the amount of $26,198.65 which represents actual legal fees plus HST and disbursements.</P>
<P>[2] This was not a complicated case. There is no reason to award the plaintiff her actual costs incurred. Considering the principle of proportionality, the plaintiffs request is not consistent with what an unsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay as costs for this simplified procedure matter. In my view, considering the factors enumerated at Rule 57.01(1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, it is a fair and reasonable exercise of my discretion under section 131 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>. R.S.O. 1990 c. C.43 to fix costs of this action at $ 15,000 inclusive.</P>

<P>1. The appellant appeals the May 25, 2018 and August 15, 2018 Judgment of Madam Justice V. R. Chiappetta delivered following a brief reserve after a 2 day trial.</P>
<P>2. The Learned Trial Judge granted the respondent judgment, awarded her damages in respect of 15 months' notice, deducting her modest acknowledged mitigation income, but not the statutory termination pay provided to her by the appellant nor income attributable to her, from selling / promoting Max International products, or other income earned, but not disclosed, during the notice period claimed. The damages awarded to the respondent are $69,091.12. The plaintiff was also awarded costs in the all-inclusive amount of $15,000.00.</P>
<P>3. The errors made by the Trial Judge are as follows:
<P1>(a) misconstruing and misinterpreting the facts and the law regarding the effect of the respondent's resignation on March 28, 2005;</P1>
<P1>(b) failing to properly consider and apply the clear evidence regarding the respondent's many credibility issues;</P1>
<P1>(c) not properly calculating the respondent's damages; and</P1>
<P1>(d) failing to properly consider and apply the facts and the evidence regarding the respondent's failure to take adequate or appropriate steps to mitigate her alleged damages.</P1></P>
<P>4. The appellant submits that these constitute palpable and overriding errors justifying this court's intervention.</P>
<P>5. The appellant appeals the issue of costs only to the extent that it seeks the costs of the appeal and the action if this appeal is successful.

<P>9. These issues are as per the headings used in the Learned Trial Judge's Reasons for Judgment.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Employment Relationship and the Chronological Sequence</TI>
<P>10. The plaintiff commenced working for Dr. Victor Kutcher, (&ldquo;Dr. Kutcher&rdquo;) a periodontist practicing in Stoney Creek in the province of Ontario, in September 1993. At the time, Dr. Kutcher was practicing as an unincorporated sole practitioner.</P>
<P>11. In 1997 3395022 Canada Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;3395022&rdquo;)</BOLD> was incorporated as a hygiene company. Throughout its existence it always employed all of and only the hygienists employed in the dental practice. The plaintiff was paid by 3395022 from the time of its establishment until December 31, 2011. Neither Dr. Kutcher nor any of the dental assistants or administrative staff were ever compensated through 3395022. 3395022 was not owned, either directly or beneficially, by Dr. Kutcher.
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Merren Kutcher in chief, Transcript, p. 134, line 4 thru p. 144, line 25, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-C, p. 82&ndash;92</BOLD></P1>

<P>12. In 1999 the plaintiff was offered a contract of employment with 3395022 Canada Inc. <BOLD>(&ldquo;3395022&rdquo;),</BOLD> a duly incorporated hygiene services company which provided the plaintiff's services, and those of other dental hygienists, to Dr. Kutcher's practice. The plaintiff signed a written employment agreement dated May 5, 1999 with 3395022 as her employer. <BOLD>[Exhibit 1&mdash;Employment Agreement dated May 5, 1999, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-1, pp. 142&ndash;144]</BOLD> This document is not relevant to the appeal. The appellant accepts the Trial Judge's finding in regard to this document.</P>
<P>13. Via letter dated March 28, 2005, the plaintiff tendered her resignation effective July 7, 2005 [3 <TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> months notice]. <BOLD>[Exhibit 2&mdash;Letter of resignation, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-2, p. 145]</BOLD> The resignation was accepted. Her resignation was based upon the fact that she (a) was engaged to marry a dentist who resided and practiced in Guelph, (b) she had already moved to Guelph and had been commuting from there to Stoney Creek while still working for 3395022; and (c) she had accepted a term employment contract to fill in for a maternity leave in another dentist's office in Guelph.

<P>14. Dr. Kutcher, through his admin staff, specifically the office manager Leslie Feaver, had placed ads for a dental hygienist to fill the vacant position created by the respondent's resignation in (a) the Hamilton Spectator and (b) in the publication of the Ontario Dental Hygienist Association. A number of resumes were received&mdash;four of them were made exhibits at trial.

<P>15. In late June 2005 the plaintiff asked to be rehired by 3395022 as her personal situation had changed. Although the defendant had spent monies advertising the position, had received resumes and had interviewed other candidates, to accommodate her request, and because Dr. Kutcher recognized the plaintiff's superior skills as a hygienist, he discussed the matter with his wife, the principal of 3395022, and she prepared a new employment agreement which was then presented to the plaintiff. The plaintiff executed it on June 30, 2005. In this instance the employer was again 3395022 Canada Inc. Justice Chiappetta made a specific finding that <EM>&ldquo;the plaintiff was presented with and signed an employment agreement... which limited the liability of 399, should it terminate the plaintiff without cause, to notice or payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the ESA&rdquo;</EM>. She also noted the conflict in the evidence between the respondent and Dr. Kutcher in respect of the effect of that new agreement.

<P>16. In cross-examination, Dr. Kutcher was challenged: <EM>&ldquo;So, what did she gain by signing that contract? What's your understanding?&rdquo;</EM> Dr. Kutcher's response was <EM>&ldquo;A job&rdquo;</EM>. It was clear from Dr. Kutcher's evidence, and from the relevant events, that the position from which Ms. Theberge resigned would be offered to someone else if a new contract was not entered into, starting the clock on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; employment relationship.
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Dr. Victor Kutcher, Transcript, p. 232, lines 27&ndash;29, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-F, p. 138</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. 3395022 had been created and used as a hygiene services company at a time when dentists were not permitted to incorporate professional corporations. This necessitated the use of multiple entities and more complicated accounting and administrative practices. A decision was made, after the legislation was changed, to: (a) set up a professional corporation [in 2006]; (b) wind up 3395022 [in 2011] and (c) employ the hygienists through the professional corporation [in 2012].</P>
<P>18. The plaintiff was given three months advance notice, via letter dated October 1, 2011, that 3395022 was being wound up and that her employment with that entity would come to an end effective December 31, 2011. In accordance with the provisions of the then current employment agreement [the June 30, 2005 agreement], the plaintiff was given notice of termination. It was in excess of the statutory requirements provided for in the employment agreement. She was given 3 months' notice [13 weeks vs the notice of 6 weeks required under the provisions of the <EM>Employment Standards Act, 2000</EM>&mdash;at that time as per the June 30, 2005 employment agreement]. In fact, as Dr. Kutcher testified, without cross-examination or contradiction on the point, the staff, including the plaintiff, were made aware of the planned change prior to October 1, 2011.

<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Dr. Victor Kutcher, Transcript, p. 191, line 20 thru p. 192, line 31, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-F, pp. 105 -106</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. 3395022 ceased operations on December 31, 2011 and a Certificate of Dissolution was issued in respect of the corporation on May 7, 2012. The plaintiff was issued a Record of Employment.
<P1><BOLD>Certificate of Dissolution, Exhibit 24, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;24, p. 200</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Merren Kutcher, Transcript, p. 140, line 15 thru p. 143, line 25, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-C, p. 88&ndash;91</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Record of Employment, dated January 2, 2012, Exhibit 5, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8-5, p. 150</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. Following the notice of termination of her employment, referenced above, the plaintiff was offered employment by Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation, an incorporated entity operated by Dr. Kutcher. The plaintiff was given a draft copy of a new employment agreement and she was invited to consider the offer and seek whatever advice or counsel she chose.</P>
<P>21. The plaintiff executed the new employment agreement on December 22, 2011. In doing so, the plaintiff executed the third page, initialed both the first and second pages and specifically initialed two paragraphs on the second page where deletions had been made.
<P1><BOLD>Employment Agreement, executed December 22, 2011, Exhibit 6, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-6, pp. 151&ndash;153</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The plaintiff advised Dr. Kutcher, and others, that before accepting and executing the new employment agreement, she and two other hygienists [Lynn Graham and Linda Herechuk] had sought and obtained independent legal advice with respect to the terms and conditions of the new employment agreement. The plaintiff and Ms. Graham accepted an employment offer. Ms. Herechuk did not.
<P1><BOLD>Memorandum, dated March 16, 2012</BOLD> [as to the plaintiff's signature] <BOLD>and March 19, 2012</BOLD> [as to Lynn Graham's signature], <BOLD>Exhibit 17&mdash;Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;17, p. 188</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. On cross-examination the plaintiff confirmed (a) having sent a copy of the draft employment agreement to a lawyer [Julie Berridge of Mills &amp; Mills]; (b) having, with Ms. Graham and Ms. Herechuk, sat in her car outside the dental office and discussed the draft agreement on speakerphone with Ms. Berridge; (c) based upon the advice she received from Ms. Berridge, having requested, to which Dr. Kutcher agreed, the deletion of the provision which required her to give at least 8 weeks' notice if she was leaving <BOLD>[Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8-6, p. 152, second paragraph];</BOLD> and (d) having signed the agreement.</P>
<P>24. The requirement of 8 weeks' notice from the respondent if she resigned was deleted at her request. It had been included in the contract because of the difficulty of dentists finding qualified replacement hygienists in Southern Ontario because it was a good market for hygienists. As Dr. Kutcher testified: <EM>&ldquo;I wanted to have a fair bit of notice in order to look to replace them, because it was getting tougher to find hygienists and that if they were to leave at the last minute I wanted&mdash;this was a basically a disincentive to have them kind of walk out.&rdquo;</EM>
<P1><BOLD>Transcript, evidence of Dr. Kutcher, p, 205, lines 20&ndash;25, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-F, p. 119</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. Dr. Kutcher testified, on cross-examination, that the deletion in the fourth paragraph [page 2 of the agreement], which was an eight week termination notice by the employer to Ms. Theberge, was at his initiation. He explained that the rationale for removal of this eight week notice provision by the employer was because he had expressed to the plaintiff his concerns about (a) her more regular than usual tardiness and (b) her continuing to discuss with and selling Max International supplements [what she called in her evidence &ldquo;nutraceuticals&rdquo;] to patients during hygiene appointments. He further explained that he told the plaintiff she had to demonstrate her commitment to the practice and its patients. She acknowledged and agreed with his concerns and initialed this deletion.</P>
<P>26. Lynn Graham confirmed that she and her two colleagues had received legal advice from Ms. Berridge, as described by Ms. Theberge in her evidence on cross-examination.
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Jasmine Theberge, Transcript, p. 24, lines 11&ndash;26; p. 69, line 28 thru p.74, line 31, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 35; 54&ndash;59</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Dr. Victor Kutcher, Transcript, p. 206, line 2 thru p. 208, line 19, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-F, pp. 120&ndash;122</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Lynn Graham, Transcript, p. 176, lines 5&ndash;28; p. 178, lines 9&ndash;13, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-E, pp. 96; 97</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Dr. Kutcher denied in his evidence that he (a) ever told the plaintiff, or other hygienists, they should not worry about signing the contracts he offered them; (b) or that <EM>&ldquo;if, you don't sign the contract, your gone&rdquo;</EM> and (c) that he put time limits on their responding to the contracts he offered them. The Trial Judge indicated that <EM>&ldquo;the plaintiff had to sign the contract prior to the end of the 2011 fiscal year end in order to continue employment.&rdquo;</EM> <BOLD>[Reasons, para 13&mdash;Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 3, pp. 8-9]</BOLD>
<P1><BOLD>Evidence of Dr. Victor Kutcher, Transcript, p. 220, lines 1&ndash;32; p. 247, lines 14&ndash;26, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-F, pp. 134; 140</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. On December 20, 2012 the plaintiff was given notice of the termination of her employment, with Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation, effective that day and was further advised that she would be provided payment in lieu of notice and her final pay, including payment for the day on which the termination occurred, plus her vacation pay to the end of the notice period, in accordance with the terms of her employment agreement. She was again provided with a Record of Employment.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;Issues on the Appeal</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Preliminary Matters</EM></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>A&mdash;Who is / was the Employer?</TI>
<P>31. It is clear, and acknowledged, that at the time of the plaintiff's termination on December 20, 2012 her employer was Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation. However, throughout her employment she had three different employers. [1] Dr. Victor Kutcher, operating as a sole practitioner from 1993 to 1997; [2] 3395022 Canada Inc., from 1997 to December 31, 2011; and [3] Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation, from January 1 to December 20, 2012.</P>
<P>32. It has been well established, since the House of Lords' decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Salomon v. Salomon</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>&ldquo;That beginning is found in the House of Lords' decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1895-9] All E.R. 33</CITE><COURTJUR>H.L.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, which established that a company, once legally incorporated, must be treated like any other independent person, with rights and liabilities appropriate to itself. From time to time, litigants have sought to lift this &ldquo;corporate veil&rdquo;, by seeking to make principals of the corporation liable for the obligations of the corporation. However, where, as here, the plaintiff relies upon establishing an independent cause of action against the principals of the company, the corporate veil is not threatened and the Salomon principle remains intact.&rdquo; per Carthy J A, in <CASEREF><SOC>ADGA Systems International Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1999 CanLII 1527</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that the identity of a corporate entity and its shareholders or others associated with it are legally separate and distinct. This decision is regularly cited in reference to cases where the issue is the manner in which business people structure their business affairs through the use of corporate entities. The principle is referred to as the &ldquo;corporate separateness principle&rdquo;. It was recently applied by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corporation</SOC><CITE>2018 ONCA 472</CITE></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>33. 3395022 Canada Inc. <BOLD>[&ldquo;3395022&rdquo;]</BOLD> was set up and used as a hygiene services company to, inter alia, employ dental hygienists at a time when dentistry professionals were not able to use professional corporations to operate their practices.</P>
<P>34. 3395022 was properly structured and properly operated. All proper record keeping and legislatively required filings were made. It served as the plaintiff's employer for a period of time and sometime after professional corporations were permitted for the dental profession its use was no longer necessary and having only a professional corporation simplified accounting and administrative processes and the structure was accordingly changed. When that occurred, the plaintiff, and the other hygienists were given 3 months' notice of termination by 3395022 prior to its windup and the hygienists were then offered employment with Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation. If, as the Trial Judge held, the June 30, 2005 contract was not binding, which is disputed, this constituted a dismissal with combined notice of 15 months comprised of: (a) 3 months prior notice [October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011] and (b) continued employment for another 12 months [January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012].</P>
<P>35. There was nothing improper in this arrangement. Professional advice, both legal and accounting / tax, was sought and followed in the structuring of the business.

<BLOCK3><TI>B&mdash;Credibility of the Evidence</TI>
<P>36. The plaintiff's evidence in this matter must be viewed with doubt and skepticism based upon the following.
<P1>(a) Her failure to address, either in her Statement of Claim, or by way of Reply to the Statement of Defence: (i) the two prior employment agreements <BOLD>[Exhibit 1&mdash;Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-1, pp. 142&ndash;144 and Exhibit 3&mdash;Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-3, pp. 146&ndash;148];</BOLD> (ii) her resignation of her employment on March 28, 2005 <BOLD>[Exhibit 2, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-2, p. 145];</BOLD> (iii) the fact that she had legal advice <BOLD>[Exhibit 17, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;17, p. 188];</BOLD> or (iv) the three months advance notice of termination she received in October 2011 <BOLD>[Exhibit 16, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;16, p. 187].</BOLD> Moreover, none of these documents were produced by the plaintiff for discovery or in her document brief for trial.</P1>
<P1>(b) Deciding not to call Linda Herechuk as a witness, then attempting to give Ms. Herechuk's evidence via hearsay. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 25, line 17 thru p. 27, line 28, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 36&ndash;38]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) Insisting that the Max International business, and the income generated from it, were entirely her husband's business and income. The evidence showed that (i) she was actively involved in the Max International business all along and (ii) that during the period following her termination, neither of them had reported / claimed any income from the business. <BOLD>[Exhibit 9A - plaintiff's 2013 T1 Income Tax Return, 2013 Tax Summary&mdash;comparison of her and her husband's 2013 returns, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-9, p.165]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(d) Both Dr. Kutcher and Leslie Feaver testified that the plaintiff was selling product in the dental office despite express direction not to do so. There is direct conflict between the plaintiff's evidence on this issue and Ms. Feaver's evidence which is supported by her written notes regarding what she observed on November 28, 2012 <BOLD>[Exhibit 25&mdash;handwritten notes of Leslie Feaver dated November 29, 2012, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;25, p. 201]</BOLD> The Trial Judge made the finding that <EM>&ldquo;She</EM> [the plaintiff] <EM>also spoke to Dr. Kutcher's patients about Max products from 2010 until her termination.&rdquo;</EM> <BOLD>[Reasons para 54]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(e) While claiming that she did not sell Max International products directly to individuals, thereby denying she, or her husband, had any &ldquo;retail customer income&rdquo;, she readily acknowledged that she regularly received shipments of Max International product at the dental office. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 102, line 28 through p. 103, line 4, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 68 - 69]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(e) When asked, on discovery, to confirm whether she and her husband used the same tax preparer, the plaintiff denied that was the case but undertook to make an inquiry of Lou Stranges [her tax preparer] and subsequently advised that he did not prepare her husband's tax returns. Notwithstanding this, she removed from her 2013 Tax Return in her document brief for trial a copy of the letter from Mr. Stranges which accompanied the production of her 2013 T1 Tax Return. <BOLD>[Exhibit 22, November 16, 2017 letter from Lou Stranges to Jasmine Theberge and Hughcliffe Lindsay, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;22, p. 198]</BOLD> This letter contains considerable detail concerning Hughcliffe Lindsay's 2013 T1 Income Tax Return, as does <BOLD>Exhibit 9A at Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-9, p. 165</BOLD>. It should be noted that her husband did not disclose any income from Max International sales either. <BOLD>[Reasons at para 55]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(f) Having testified, in chief, that following the termination she was too emotionally upset to look for work <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 30, line 20 thru p. 31, line 32, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 39-40]</BOLD>, the plaintiff was forced, on cross-examination, to admit that at the time in issue, January 2013, she was actively engaged in promoting Max International products through a series of events involving her being on conference telephone calls and direct contact with numerous people <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 112, line 30 thru p. 116, line 30, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 70&ndash;74].</BOLD> These included: (i) attending a special event in Las Vegas, accompanied by her husband, to meet the founder of Max international; (ii) participating in a number of Max International &ldquo;Saturday Calls&rdquo;; and (iii) having weekly in-home presentations to sell Max product and recruit new Max &ldquo;associates&rdquo; to work for her. Shortly after leaving the practice, in late December 2012, she was organizing and headlining Max International promotional events on a monthly basis in the local Marriott hotel. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 116, lines 17&ndash;30, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 74]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(g) Despite being faced with numerous documents from the Max International website, posted over several years beginning in January 2013 just after her termination, many of which identified her, and rarely her husband, as a &ldquo;silver&rdquo;, &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;platinum&rdquo; Associate (a significant progression through the Max International organization), implying from other Max International literature <BOLD>[Max International Compensation Plan, Exhibit 23, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;234, p. 199]</BOLD> that she was generating not insignificant income from her Max International activities, she claimed that all of these were all &ldquo;typos&rdquo;. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 120, line 7 thru p. 123, line 27, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 77&ndash;80]</BOLD> Indeed, as a spokesperson and coach for Max International she appeared or starred in many YouTube video presentations since early 2013.</P1>
<P1>(h) She failed to disclose and acknowledge the &ldquo;joint&rdquo; Max International income earned during the latter part of the notice period she claims. <BOLD>[Exhibit 10, Max international back office printout, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10, pp. 173&ndash;175; (January 1, 2013 13 through Mar 31, 2014)&mdash;the notice period awarded]</BOLD> The Learned Trial Judge failed to deduct any of this income from the damage award as mitigation income.</P1>
<P1>(i) Having also testified that she expended the effort to get her hygienists' Certificate for Self-Initiation as soon as possible after she was terminated, she did not even know that it was called a <EM>&ldquo;Certificate of Self-Initiation&rdquo;</EM> <BOLD>[see Exhibit 12, Printout from College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario Registration Database, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;12, p. 181; Transcript, p. 43, line 18 thru p. 45, line 26, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 46&ndash;48]</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(j) Having claimed to have sent or left resumes with more than 100 dental offices, she acknowledged that she was only able to identify a very small number of them from a calendar because she had lost her daytimer. It is a reasonable conclusion that the &ldquo;loss&rdquo; of the daytimer was because not only does it not show reasonable activity directed at finding employment as a dental hygienist but that it also would have shown extensive activity in Max International sales and promotion. The action wasn't started until well after the notice period sought had expired, yet she did not produce any mitigation documentation until after she was asked for it on discovery, more than 2 <TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> years after the termination and her affidavit of documents did not claim that any documents had gone missing or been destroyed.</P1>
<P1>(k) Despite her impeccable credentials as a multilingual, restorative hygienist with a Certificate of Self-Initiation, her mitigation income reflected an extremely modest rate of success. That was obtained through working in a dental hygiene clinic run by another hygienist [Bernadette Simone], who she acknowledged, in cross-examination, she worked with in promoting Max International products in YouTube videos. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 128, lines 1&ndash;10, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 81]</BOLD> She claims to have earned $3,105.63 of income as a hygienist over 12 months. <BOLD>[2013 T1 Income Tax Return, Exhibit 9A, p. 19, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-9, p. 158]</BOLD> Her total income from dental hygiene for the prior year was $59,367.00 <BOLD>[2012 T1 Income Tax Return, Exhibit 21, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;21, p. 197]</BOLD> Her 2013 stated gross income reported, represents her having worked the equivalent of only 13.6 days over the 15 month notice period she claims. That is less than 1 day per month.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>It is of some note that, although the plaintiff claims a notice period of 15 months, she only produced purported mitigation documentation for, at most, 12 months&mdash;her 2013 T1 Income Tax Return. She did not produce her 2014 Tax Return.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Yet, as reflected in her tax return, she managed to maintain two properties, her principal residence and a rental property, consistently operating as a loss according to her tax returns.</P1>
<P1>(l) Her 2013 Income Tax Return, which shows minimal total income for the entire year [$3,105.63], reflects the lease of a BMW vehicle, at a lease cost of $6,996.12 for the year, which was entered into shortly after leaving the dental practice. She claimed only 100 km of total use for the entire 2013 year [365 days] 25 km of which she claims were business use yet took $1,249.29 in deductions for business use of the vehicle.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>2013 T1 Income Tax Return, Exhibit 9A, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-9, p. 159&mdash;162</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(m) She readily acknowledged during cross-examination that she knowingly misrepresented facts concerning her activities and degree of success in regard to the Max International business in a variety of materials posted on the Max International website and in presentations, in 2013 when she claims to (a) not have been working and (b) not to be involved directly with Max International, she made on behalf of Max International's promotional activities. <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 94, line 32 thru p. 96, line 16, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 65&ndash;67]</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Errors Made by the Learned Trial Judge</EM></TI>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>1</N><TI>The Effect of the Plaintiff's Resignation in March 2005</TI>
<P>37. The appellant's first ground of appeal is that the Learned Trial Judge misconstrued and misinterpreted the facts and the law regarding the effect of the plaintiff's / respondent's resignation on March 28, 2005.</P>
<P>38. As set out above, the evidence is clear that the plaintiff formally resigned her employment. The resignation was <EM>&ldquo;clear and unequivocal&rdquo;</EM> and was accepted and her employer sought to replace her. The Trial Judge's reliance on the lack of materiality of the employer's cost to run a newspaper ad is a red herring. A key source of applicants was, in fact, from the Ontario Hygienists Association which did not charge for their advertising. The employer accepted the resignation and went through the process of seeking candidates to replace Ms. Theberge.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kieran v. Ingram Micro Inc.</SOC><CITE>2004 CanLII 4852</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para 27</BOLD> <UNDER>&lt;http://canlii.ca/t/1hkjm&gt;</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>39. There is no evidence before the court, and there is not any issue pled by the plaintiff / respondent, to suggest that the plaintiff's subsequent employment, commencing on Monday, July 11, 2005 was anything other than the commencement of a new contractual arrangement.</P>
<P>40. There is nothing to support any suggestion of the revocation or withdrawal of the resignation. Rather, as admitted by the plaintiff / respondent, and as acknowledged by the Learned Trial Judge, Ms. Theberge entered into a new contract of employment. Contrary to the Judge's suggestion that there was no consideration to support a new contract being established, Dr. Kutcher's answer on cross-examination that the consideration for the contract was <EM>&ldquo;a job&rdquo;</EM> is a full and proper answer to both the question and the issue. The Learned Trial Judge's statement that <EM>&ldquo;Her resignation was rescinded well prior to July 7, 2005&rdquo;</EM> <BOLD>[Reasons for Judgment at para 29]</BOLD> is unsupported by the facts or the evidence.</P>
<P>41. It is submitted that the Learned Trial Judge made a palpable and overriding error in this regard. In consequence:
<P1>a) because the parties did not expressly agree / contract otherwise, Ms. Theberge's tenure commenced effective Monday, July 11, 2005; and</P1>
<P1>b) the employment agreement executed by the parties on that date, and its terms and conditions, <BOLD>[Exhibit 3, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-3, pp. 146&ndash;148],</BOLD> including the termination provision in that agreement, governed the employment relationship thereafter.</P1></P>
<P>42. The foregoing submissions are supported by the August 31, 2018 decision of Justice Edwards in <CASEREF><SOC>English v. Manulife Financial Corporation</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 5135 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>. <UNDER>&lt;http://canlii.ca/t/htr7r&gt;</UNDER> In his Reasons for Decision, Justice Edwards conducted a thorough review of the law on the issue of an employee's ability to rescind a voluntary resignation.</P>
<P>43. Specifically, Justice Edwards held that the requirement that an individual could rescind a resignation unless the employer had relied, to its detriment, on the resignation was not the law of Ontario and that the statement found in the Court of Appeal's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Kieran v. Ingram Micro Inc.</SOC><CITE>2004 (CanLII) 4852</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [at para 34] <UNDER>&lt;http://canlii.ca/t/1hkjm&gt;</UNDER> was obiter and <EM>&ldquo;The law in my view has evolved, and is now more a reflection of basic contract law&rdquo;</EM>, [at para 30] In support of this conclusion Justice Edwards referred to decisions of the Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Courts of Appeal and another decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>2</N><TI>Credibility Issues Concerning the Plaintiff's Evidence</TI>
<P>44. Despite acknowledging that the appellant's counsel had raised numerous issues regarding the plaintiff's credibility during trial, and in submissions <BOLD>[Reasons for Judgment at para 53 and Transcript, p. 118, line 28 thru p. 119, line 5, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 75 - 76].</BOLD> The Learned Trial Judge failed to address, in making her decision, the impact of the issues put forward by the appellant in this regard. As set out above [see sub-paras 36 (a) - (m)] the appellant raised, at trial, many significant matters which clearly demonstrated serious issues regarding the plaintiff's credibility. The Learned Trial Judge refers to this submission at paragraph 53 of her Reasons. However, she failed to properly address the credibility issues, even in a cursory manner.</P>
<P>45. It is important to note that the Learned Trial Judge does not make any findings adverse to any of the credibility of any of the appellant's witnesses. At best, she says that she accepts the plaintiff's evidence, even where it is in stark contrast to documentary evidence accepted into evidence without any contradiction being offered.</P>
<P>46. The appellant submits that the Learned Trial Judge's failure to properly and adequately address this issue constitutes reversible error.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>3</N><TI>The Failure to Properly Calculate the Respondent's Damages</TI>
<P>47. The respondent did not properly prove her damages. Specifically:
<P1>a) she pled the same figure for both her annual income figure and for the 15 month notice period she claimed;</P1>
<P1>b) the only documentary evidence she tendered was her T4 Statement of Remuneration Paid for 2012 <BOLD>[Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Exhibit 8, Tab 8-8, p. 155]</BOLD> but offered no submissions to explain the number&mdash;the evidence was that her earnings varied based upon the hours she actually worked;</P1>
<P1>c) she acknowledged having started full time work with a dentist [Dr. Maini] in March 2014&mdash;within the notice period claimed <BOLD>[Transcript, p. 32, line 27 thru p. 33, line 7, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 41 - 42];</BOLD></P1>
<P1>d) she did not produce proper evidence of or quantum for income from 2014, including whatever she earned from working for Dr. Maini in March 2014; and</P1>
<P1>e) she did however produce some evidence of income received jointly by her and her husband for February and March 2014 [within the notice period&mdash;<BOLD>Exhibit 10 at trial, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10, p. 173]</BOLD> but with the bulk of the notice period having the Max International payments / income statement with the payee information removed and substantial 2013 income attributable to her and/or her husband&mdash;<BOLD>Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10 pp. 173&ndash;175;</BOLD> Exhibit 10 was a document the plaintiff / respondent downloaded from the Max International website.
<P2><BOLD>Transcript, evidence in chief&mdash;p. 38, line 25 thru p. 40, line 17, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, pp. 43&ndash;45; cross-examination at p. 91, lines 10&ndash;20, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7-B, p. 64</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>48. While the Learned Trial Judge did deduct from the damage award the modest amount of income the respondent reported on her 2013 T1 General Income Tax Return, she did not deduct: (a) the statutory termination pay which was paid to the respondent <BOLD>[Exhibit 18, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;18, pp. 189 - 190]</BOLD> by Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation; or any of the joint income earned by the respondent and her husband from Max International <BOLD>[Exhibit 10, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10, pp. 173&ndash;175].</BOLD> As such, the respondent was overcompensated in the award of damages made.</P>
<P>49. The appellant submits that the foregoing also constitutes reversible error.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>4</N><TI>The Plaintiff's Failure to Properly or Adequately Mitigate</TI>
<P>50. At paragraph 51 of the Reasons for Judgment the Learned Trial Judge stated:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[51] The plaintiff presented no physical evidence of her mitigation efforts. She testified that she lost her day timer and was only able to identify a small fraction of her efforts</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>51. It is submitted that the failure to properly weigh and consider all of the evidence, and particularly the inconsistencies and contradictions contained within the respondent's evidence during trial reflects and represents a palpable and overriding error justifying intervention by this Court.</P>
<P>52. It is unbelievable that's someone with the respondent's credentials could not find an employment position or more freelance / independent contract work reflecting less than 1 day per month during the 15 month notice period she claimed.</P>
<P>53. Curiously, at the end of the notice period claimed, the end of March 2014, not only does she acknowledge having found fully mitigating employment but that, just prior to that date [the middle of February 2014&mdash;see <BOLD>Exhibit 10&mdash;printout from Max International &ldquo;backoffice&rdquo; file on monies paid to Jasmine Theberge and / or Hughcliffe Lindsay, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10 at page 173]</BOLD> she acknowledges that she began receiving compensation, jointly with her husband, from Max International. This, coupled with what came out during her cross-examination regarding her involvement with Max International, since early 2010&mdash;without any attributed income, belies her version of what took place after her termination by Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation. By September 2014, barely 7 months after the end of the notice period, the business was entirely hers <BOLD>[see Exhibit 10, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;10, at page 171]</BOLD> without her providing any compensation to her husband. Her testimony was that her ex-husband walked away from it and gave her the business. This suggests that, along with the many You Tube videos she acknowledged making on behalf of Max International, and the recognition of &ldquo;gold level&rdquo; performance that she (and she alone) received from Max International, it was always her business. It also supports the proposition that she diverted or continued to divert the income to her husband, although the evidence demonstrates that neither of them reported any of the Max International income for income tax purposes. <BOLD>[Reasons for Judgment at paras 55&ndash;57]</BOLD> At a minimum, the Learned Trial Judge acknowledges that the plaintiff / respondent received mitigation income in the last two months of the notice period yet that income was not disclosed by her and it was not considered in the assessment of her damages. <BOLD>[Reasons at para 55]</BOLD></P>
<P>54. Moreover, the paucity of the plaintiff's evidence on her mitigation efforts also belies her position and adds more doubt to her credibility on this and all other issues. Her evidence on her mitigation efforts was limited to the following.

<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Summary and Conclusion</EM></TI>
<P>55. The plaintiff executed 3 employment agreements containing the same termination language she challenges in this proceeding.
<P1>a) <BOLD>May 5, 1999&mdash;Exhibit 1&mdash;Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-1, pp. 142&ndash;144</BOLD></P1>
<P1>b) <BOLD>June 30, 2005&mdash;Exhibit 3&mdash;Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-3, pp. 146&ndash;48</BOLD></P1>
<P1>c) <BOLD>December 22, 2011&mdash;Exhibit 6&mdash;Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-6, pp. 151&ndash;153</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. On March 28, 2005, the plaintiff resigned her employment. <BOLD>Exhibit 2, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-2, pp. 142&ndash;144.</BOLD> Her resignation was accepted. She subsequently requested that she be hired again. Merren Kutcher and Dr. Kutcher discussed the matter and decided to offer her employment and she signed a new employment agreement on June 30, 2005. <BOLD>[Exhibit 3, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-3, pp. 146&ndash;148]</BOLD> Without that new employment agreement she would not have had employment.</P>
<P>57. Via letter dated October 1, 2011 she was provided with 3 months advance formal notice of the termination of her employment. <BOLD>[Exhibit 16, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;16, p. 187]</BOLD> On December 22, 2011, after receiving independent legal advice and negotiating changes to the document, the plaintiff executed the third employment agreement. <BOLD>[Exhibit 6, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;6, pp. 151&mdash;153]</BOLD></P>
<P>58. In mid-March 2012, the plaintiff confirmed in writing <BOLD>[Exhibit 17, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;17, p. 188]</BOLD> that she and two other hygienists had obtained legal advice concerning the proposed new employment contract they were asked to sign in late December 2011 and which she subsequently signed on December 22, 2011&mdash;<BOLD>[Exhibit 6, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8-6, pp. 151&ndash;153]</BOLD></P>
<P>59. She received notice of termination on December 20, 2012. This action was commenced on December 3, 2014.</P>
<P>60. The defendant submits that, based upon all of the foregoing, the plaintiff was lawfully terminated on December 20, 2012. At the time she was <BOLD>contractually</BOLD> entitled, <BOLD>by mutual agreement</BOLD>, to one week of notice or pay in lieu of notice, the latter of which she received.</P>

In the alternative, the defendant submits that, if the employment agreements are unenforceable and ineffective, the plaintiff's termination occurred as a result of the October 1, 2011 notice of termination <BOLD>[Exhibit 16, Appeal Book &amp; Compendium, Tab 8&ndash;16, p. 187].</BOLD> The plaintiff received 3 months of working notice and remained employed by the defendant for the ensuing 12 months and therefore received a total of 15 months of effective notice.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">Introduction</TI>
<P>1. In essence the appellant disagrees with the findings of the leaned trial judge, the Honourable Justice Chiappetta, which holding was based on a careful consideration of the evidence. The appellant fails to disclose specific errors, rather expressing broad dissatisfaction. Further, the broad critique of the decision in the respondent's factum certainly does not successfully argue an error or errors that rise to the palpable and overriding standard.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">Part I: Overview and Issues at Trial</TI>
<P>2. In this section the respondent relies on Justice Chiappetta's decision as found at paragraphs 1, 2, 19 and 20 of the decision [Appeal Book and Compendium hereinafter &ldquo;compendium&rdquo; at Tab 1 pp. 1 and 4].</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>[1] This case re-visits the dichotomy between the entitlement of a long-time employee to reasonable pay in lieu of notice of termination and the ability of an employer to contractually limit its notice obligations. The background facts are not significantly in issue but are unique in the way they present the issue to the court.</P>
<P>[2] The plaintiff commenced work with Dr. Victor Kutcher as a dental hygienist in 1993. Dr. Kutcher is a dentist and periodontist practicing in Stoney Creek, Ontario. At this time Dr. Kutcher was practicing as an unincorporated sole practitioner. The plaintiff was not asked to nor did she sign an employment contract upon the commencement of her employment in 1993.</P>
<P>[19] At all times between 1993 and December 20, 2012 the plaintiff's employment as a hygienist for Dr. Kutcher's practice continued uninterrupted. It was Dr. Kutcher who consistently signed her pay cheques. The cheques were issued from Dr. Kutcher personally from 1993 to 1999, by 339 from 1999 to 2011 and by Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation in 2012.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Issues</UNDER></TI>
<P>[20] The parties agreed that the facts present the following issues to the court:
<P1>1. What is the plaintiff's length of service with Kutcher Dentistry Professional Corporation?</P1>
<P1>2. Is there an enforceable employment agreement?</P1>
<P1>3. If there is an enforceable employment agreement, does that agreement limit the plaintiff to only the minimum amounts provided by the <UNDER>ESA</UNDER> on termination?</P1>
<P1>4. What notice period is the plaintiff entitled to, and what are the damages related thereto?</P1>
<P1>5. Did the plaintiff take adequate steps to mitigate her damages?</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">Part II: Relevant Facts to Appeal</TI>
<P>3. The learned trial judge correctly asserts that the background facts are largely agreed to. Any factual differences prior to 2005 are moot as the appellant has accepted the learned trial judge's finding related thereto in its factum. The respondent relies fully on the findings of fact related to the resignation and the subsequent rescission thereof found in the Justice Chiappetta's decision at paragraphs 29 and 30 of the decision [compendium Tab 1 p. 6] which holding was based on a careful consideration of the evidence, and in so disagrees with the appellant that these findings represent palpable and overriding errors.</P>
<P>[29] Separately, by correspondence dated March 28, 2005 the plaintiff advised that her last day working for the practice of Dr. Kutcher was to be July 7, 2005. Her resignation was rescinded well prior to July 7, 2005. The evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff was happy to remain employed with the practice of Dr. Kutcher and Dr. Kutcher was happy that she was to do so. The plaintiff continued with her responsibilities for the practice consistently and without interruption after March 28, 2005. Dr. Kutcher's efforts to replace the plaintiff were brief and uncostly. A record of employment was never issued at this time. By correspondence dated February 20, 2006, for the purposes of the plaintiff obtaining financing, Dr. Kutcher penned a letter to whom it may concern, confirming her employment &ldquo;in our office since 1993.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[30] The evidence demonstrates that the retraction of the resignation was accepted by Dr. Kutcher and that the circumstances of the 2005 resignation had no impact on the plaintiff's continuity of service with the practice of Dr. Kutcher. It further indicates that that at least in February 2006, Dr. Kutcher was prepared to recognize the continuity of the plaintiff's employment with his practice since 1993, independent of both her rescinded resignation and his use of 339.</P>
<P>4. Further, the respondent agrees with the learned trial judge's findings of fact and in so disagree with the appellant's materials as it relates to the nature of consideration, or, lack thereof, and the origination of new employment, or, lack thereof, found at paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 of the decision [compendium Tab 1 p. 6] which holding was based on careful consideration of the evidence.</P>
<P>[26] Throughout the 19 years, the plaintiff was employed by 3 separate legal entities. Significantly however, during this time the plaintiff worked at the same location and performed the same job under the management of Dr. Kutcher. Her employment was consistently in the operation of the dental and periodontal practice of Dr. Kutcher. The primary employment relationship was always between Dr. Kutcher and the plaintiff. Dr. Kutcher structured the employer of his practice's hygienists differently. The structure in and of itself, however, does not negate the plaintiff's continuity of employment with his practice or the control consistently maintained by Dr. Kutcher over the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment. Rather, the structure was an intentional decision made by Dr. Kutcher for his own financial benefit and has no impact on the plaintiff's continuous length of service.</P>
<P>[27] I do not accept that Mrs. Kutcher was the operating mind of 399 or that she made the final decision in terms of hiring hygienists. The evidence demonstrates that for the time of 339's existence, Mrs. Kutcher was responsible to the practice of Dr. Kutcher in the same way she was before and after 339's existence; for all accounting requirements. From 1993 to 2012, it was Dr. Kutcher who directed the work of the hygienists including the plaintiff and made all scheduling and compensation decisions. It was Dr. Kutcher who interviewed and made hiring decisions on new hygienists. And it was Dr. Kutcher who ultimately decided to terminate the plaintiff.</P>
<P>[28] It may be open to Dr. Kutcher to employ accounting practices and tax laws to design the employer of the hygienists of his practice in a way that provides him with the most financial benefit. It is not open to him however to then use that structure as a sword against the plaintiff's uninterrupted service to his practice. At all times, independent of the choice of employer as structured by Dr. Kutcher, the plaintiff was employed by the practice of Dr. Kutcher. It is the practice of Dr. Kutcher that was the plaintiff's substantive employer for over 19 years. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on her employment history with the practice of Dr. Kutcher in the calculation of reasonable notice upon termination.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">Part III: Issues Raised by the Appellant</TI>
<P>5. The appellant submits to the standard of review in this appeal being palpable and overriding error at paragraph three (3) of its factum. The appellant is arguing that the Honourable Justice Chiappetta made four (4) errors:</P>
<P>A. Misconstruing and misinterpreting the facts and the law regarding the effect of the respondent's resignation on March 28, 2005;</P>
<P>B. failing to properly consider and apply the clear evidence regarding the respondent's many credibility issues;</P>
<P>C. not properly calculating the respondents damages; and</P>
<P>D. failing to properly consider and apply the facts and the evidence regarding the respondents failure to take adequate or appropriate steps to mitigate her alleged damages.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><UNDER>A.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Misconstruing and misinterpreting the facts and the law regarding the effect of the respondent's resignation on March 28, 2005</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. It is the respondent's position that the learned trial judge's decision lays out the relevant facts and law both reasonably and correctly in addition to being free from palpable and overriding error at paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 29, 30, 34, 36, 37, 38 and 39 of the decision [compendium Tab 1 pp. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8].</P>
<P>[8] By correspondence dated March 28, 2005 the plaintiff tendered her resignation to Dr. Kutcher effective July 7, 2005. She was engaged to be married to a gentleman who lived in Guelph, Ontario. The plaintiff had secured alternative employment in Guelph to be commenced after July 6, 2005. During the notice period and prior to her effective day of resignation, in or about May 2005, the plaintiff ended her engagement and advised Dr. Kutcher of her intention to remain employed as a dental hygienist working in his office. The plaintiff testified that Dr. Kutcher told her that he was pleased to hear it as he did not want her to leave.</P>
<P>[9] On June 30, 2005 the plaintiff was presented with and signed an employment agreement between herself and 399 (&ldquo;the 2005 agreement&rdquo;). The 2005 agreement limited the liability of 399, should it terminate the plaintiff without cause, to notice or payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the <UNDER><EM>ESA</EM></UNDER>. Again, the plaintiff testified that she reviewed the agreement with Dr. Kutcher prior to signing it. Her evidence is that Dr. Kutcher advised her not to worry about the termination provision as &ldquo;it was never going to happen.&rdquo; Dr. Kutcher denies he made this statement. Dr. Kutcher signed the 2005 agreement on behalf of 399. The plaintiff continued her employment with Dr. Kutcher without interruption between March 28, 2005 and June 30, 2005. There were no changes to the terms and conditions of her employment as a result of the 2005 agreement.</P>
<P>[10] Throughout the period of notice of resignation and prior to the effective date of resignation, Dr. Kutcher commenced the process of hiring a hygienist. He advertised the position for a cost of $365.94, received resumes and conducted interviews. All resumes presented to the court were addressed to Dr. Kutcher, not Mrs. Kutcher. No offers of employment were made as Dr. Kutcher testified that he was getting the sense from the plaintiff that things were not working with her fianc&ea;.</P>
<P>[29] Separately, by correspondence dated March 28, 2005 the plaintiff advised that her last day working for the practice of Dr. Kutcher was to be July 7, 2005. Her resignation was rescinded well prior to July 7, 2005. The evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff was happy to remain employed with the practice of Dr. Kutcher and Dr. Kutcher was happy that she was to do so. The plaintiff continued with her responsibilities for the practice consistently and without interruption after March 28, 2005. Dr. Kutcher's efforts to replace the plaintiff were brief and uncostly. A record of employment was never issued at this time. By correspondence dated February 20, 2006, for the purposes of the plaintiff obtaining financing, Dr. Kutcher penned a letter to whom it may concern, confirming her employment &ldquo;in our office since 1993.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[30] The evidence demonstrates that the retraction of the resignation was accepted by Dr. Kutcher and that the circumstances of the 2005 resignation had no impact on the plaintiff's continuity of service with the practice of Dr. Kutcher. It further indicates that that at least in February 2006, Dr. Kutcher was prepared to recognize the continuity of the plaintiff's employment with his practice since 1993, independent of both her rescinded resignation and his use of 339.</P>
<P>[34] The 2005 agreement was signed between the plaintiff and 339. Again, the evidence demonstrates that it was signed in contemplation of continued employment and the terms and conditions of employment for the plaintiff were unchanged in the months before and after the execution of the 2005 agreement. There is no evidence that the plaintiff received independent legal advice prior to signing the contract.</P>
<P>[36] To modify an existing employment contract, there must be fresh consideration beyond continued employment: <CASEREF><SOC>Hobbs v. TDI Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2004 CanLII 44783</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 35-6, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Techform Products Ltd. v.

<P>[37] The requirement for fresh consideration is particularly pronounced where the employer seeks to modify the employment contract to limit the notice to be provided upon termination, since that change represents &ldquo;a tremendously significant modification of the implied term of reasonable notice&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Francis v.

<P>[38] In <CASEREF><SOC>Clarke v. Insight Components (Canada) Inc.</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 837 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF>, a modified employment contract that reduced the notice of termination provided upon termination was valid because it introduced fresh consideration by way of a promotion and added benefits for the employee. No such consideration is found here. Other cases that distinguish <EM>Francis, Hobbs</EM>, and <EM>Braiden</EM> also do so based on facts not present here, such as attempts to negotiate a modified employment contract on the part of the employee seeking to telecommute: see <CASEREF><SOC>Riskie v.

<P>[39] In my view, none of the three employment contracts signed by the plaintiff are enforceable. Each of the contracts fail respectively for lack of consideration. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the intention of Dr. Kutcher was that each of the three contracts needed to be signed or the plaintiff could not continue to be employed with his practice. While there is no evidence of threat or duress, Dr. Kutcher was firm in his testimony that continued employment was conditional on the signing of the agreements. The plaintiff and Ms. Graham both testified to their understanding of this fact pertaining to the 2011 agreement. The plaintiff received no more from signing each of the three agreements but for continued employment. The fact that she received independent legal advice pertaining to the 2011 agreement does not negate this fact. Further, the three agreements, if enforceable, would substantially reduce the plaintiff's entitlements on termination.</P>
<P>7. The respondent relies on the correctness and reasonableness of the trial judge's findings, the considerate manner in which all evidence was dealt with and the careful application of the relevant caselaw and the detailed explanation found within the decision of the reasons for judgement as clear evidence no palpable or overriding errors exist therein.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><UNDER>B.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Failing to properly consider and apply the clear evidence regarding the respondent's many credibility issues;</UNDER></TI></BLOCK3>

<BLOCK3><N><UNDER>D.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>failing to properly consider and apply the facts and the evidence regarding the respondents failure to take adequate or appropriate steps to mitigate her alleged damages.</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. The respondent will deal with the next three (3) alleged errors at once as all relate to the facts following the termination in 2012 and the allegations that the respondent both failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate her damages and that she did in fact did mitigate some of her damages.</P>
<P>9. The learned trial judge goes into great detail in explaining the evidentiary basis for findings of fact as well as the legal bases for the consequences at law related thereto. The respondent relies on paragraphs 47 through 60 [compendium Tab 1 pp. 9&ndash;11].</P>
<P>[47] According to the Supreme Court of Canada a wrongfully dismissed employee is entitled to recover losses flowing from her wrongful termination, subject to her efforts to mitigate those losses. When assessing mitigation efforts courts ask &ldquo;whether [the employee] has stood idly or unreasonably by, or has tried without success to obtain other employment&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Red Deer College v.

<P>[48] The plaintiff testified that after the Christmas holiday season she began to immediately look for work although she stated that she was in no condition to work as her trust was shattered and she would sob uncontrollably. The plaintiff worked with Dr. Kutcher and specific clients for 19 years. She thought of him as family. She was heart-broken by her termination.</P>
<P>[49] The plaintiff's evidence is that she contacted over 100 dentists in the Hamilton area seeking employment as a hygienist. She mailed her resume and she physically attended at the offices of dentists to present her resume. The plaintiff asked Dr. Kutcher for a letter of reference. He declined her request and stated that he would provide a recommendation if he was called by a prospective employer. The plaintiff had an interview with an office in Grimsby, Ontario. She did not get the job after the prospective employer spoke with Dr. Kutcher. The plaintiff applied for and received a license to permit her to work independently as a hygienist in a clinic that does not have a dentist (license to self -initiate). She sought work through a temp agency and attempted to develop her own business as a hygienist working in a hygiene clinic. The plaintiff was able to mitigate approximately $2,558.90 of her damages during the 15 month notice period.</P>
<P>[50] Dr. Kutcher introduced a 2013 economic report to the dental profession prepared for the Ontario Dental Association. He relied on the report to demonstrate that there was a high demand for hygienists in 2013 and the defendant's submission that &ldquo;it is unbelievable that someone with [the plaintiff's] credentials could not find an employment position or more freelance /independent contract work reflecting less than 1 day per month during the notice period she claims.&rdquo; The report is unhelpful however in assessing the veracity of the plaintiff's mitigation efforts as it fails to speak to the supply and demand of hygienists in the Hamilton area.</P>
<P>[51] The plaintiff presented no physical evidence of her mitigation efforts. She testified that she lost her day timer and was only able to identify a small fraction of her efforts.</P>
<P>[52] I accept the plaintiff's testimony at trial and conclude that she made reasonable efforts to mitigate her damages by seeking employment as a hygienist. I found her to be credible when she spoke about her intention to stay employed in the profession in which she practiced and excelled at since graduating from her studies in the area.</P>
<P>[53] The defendant submits that the plaintiff is not credible. Most of its submissions stems from the plaintiff's involvement in Max International.</P>
<P>[54] The plaintiff testified that in September 2014, she took over her now ex-husband's business with Max International (&ldquo;Max&rdquo;). Max is a health and wellness company offering specific supplements for sale. The plaintiff's ex-husband had been selling Max products since 2010. The plaintiff supported his effort since 2010 by regularly educating members and prospective members of the Max family with respect to the science of the supplements sold. Her efforts were at times on her own and at times alongside her husband. She also spoke to Dr. Kutcher's patients about Max products from 2010 until her termination.</P>
<P>[55] The plaintiff's evidence is that she did not earn an income from her efforts with Max until she began the transition to take over her ex-husband's account with the company in February 2014. The transition was fully completed by September 2014. The plaintiff did not receive income from Max until 2014 as reflective in a Max printout which showed monies paid by Max to the plaintiff and her husband jointly during February and March 2014. It would appear however from the summary of her ex-husband's 2013 income tax return that he did not claim income from Max from that year either.</P>
<P>[56] The plaintiff testified that Lou Stranges is her bookkeeper. She states that he has never prepared a tax return for her ex-husband. A letter from Mr. Stranges dated November 2017, addressed to both the plaintiff and her ex-husband, suggests that he prepared and filed both of their 2013 tax returns. Mr. Stranges did not testify at trial. While the letter creates pause from the perspective of the plaintiff's ex-husband's income tax reporting obligations and the involvement of Mr. Stranges in this regard, I disagree with the defendant that the plaintiff's evidence with respect to her involvement with Max and the income derived from the business impacts on her credibility at this trial and particularly her testimony as it relates to mitigation and damages.</P>
<P>[57] I accept the plaintiff's testimony that she took over husband's Max account in 2014 and that she began receiving income jointly from Max in February 2014. I further accept that once the transition from her husband to herself was completed in September 2014, she solely began to receive income from Max.</P>
<P>[58] Prior to the commencement of the transition, the plaintiff worked to support her husband's Max account without attributed income as a devoted partner would do. The in come earned by the Max account was family income so that it makes sense to me that the plaintiff would make regular appearances on behalf of her husband's account to encourage the sale of products and the recruitment of further salespeople on behalf of and in the best financial interest of the account.</P>
<P>[59] When the plaintiff assumed her husband's account during the breakdown of the marriage, she also assumed its history. She advertised herself as having been involved with Max since 20 10 and having become a silver status performer within one month of starting with Max. The plaintiff was speaking about the account, however, not about herself or her husband individually. She testified that she did not get into specific personal details of how she took over the account in 2014 and that it was actually her husband's account before that, while she was addressing a crowd on behalf of Max. This makes sense as her efforts were to sell product and recruit people on behalf of the account, not to disclose the particulars of the ownership of the account from the perspective of the breakdown of her marriage.</P>
<P>[60] It is for these reasons that I have concluded that the plaintiff reasonably mitigated her damages.</P>
<P>10. Finally, it should be noted that, other than in regard to the respondents ex -husbands tax fillings, absolutely no evidence was led at trial that directly contradicted the respondent's testimony. Justice Chiappetta carefully weighed all the evidence and rendered a decision with detailed reasons for the holdings therein. The learned trial judge made no errors in deciding this case, let alone palpable and overriding errors in accepting evidence as true that was largely agreed to, coupled with the respondent's evidence that was never directly contradicted. Further, Justice Chiappetta summarized the case law relied upon in great detail. The appellant simply expresses dissatisfaction in its factum and nothing more.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
