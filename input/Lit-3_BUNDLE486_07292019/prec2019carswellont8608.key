<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><UNDER><BOLD>THE APPELLANT</BOLD> amends the Notice of Appeal dated April 27, 2018, from the judgment of Madam Justice Sylvia Corthorn dated March 28, 2018. This Amended Notice of Appeal shall be read in conjunction with the Supplementary Notice of Appeal dated June 6, 2018, seeking leave to appeal the costs endorsement of Madam Justice Sylvia Corthorn, dated May 22, 2018.</UNDER></P>
<P><BOLD>THE PLAINTIFF APPEALS</BOLD> to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Sylvia Corthorn dated March 28, 2018, made at Ottawa.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS</BOLD> that the judgment be varied to include:</P>
<P>1. The Appellant is entitled to reasonable notice at common law of the termination of his employment in the amount of 22 months.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT</BOLD> further requests:</P>
<P>2. The Appellant be granted its costs of the appeal on a substantial indemnity basis;</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The motion judge determined that 22 months is an appropriate reasonable notice period for the Appellant, but concluded that he did not have an entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment.</P>
<P>2. The motion judge erred in law and in mixed law and fact in making the determination that the Appellant did not have an entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment; specifically, she failed to consider in her legal analysis material factual elements and legal arguments that were before her. A summary of these facts is as follows:</P>
<P>3. During the course of his employment as an architect with the Respondent, the Appellant wished to reduce his work to part time hours in or around the spring of 2013.</P>
<P>4. The parties negotiated terms of part time employment for the Appellant, including, at the Respondent's insistence, that the Appellant resign from full time hours and waive his entitlement to termination and severance pay for his previous years of service. They also agreed that his entitlement upon termination would be limited to his <EM>Employment Standards Act (&ldquo;ESA&rdquo;)</EM> entitlements commencing from his part time start date.</P>
<P>5. The Appellant commenced working part time in or around July 15, 2013, having negotiated the above respecting the termination of his employment.</P>
<P>6. To satisfy the Respondent's requirements, on July 17, 2013, the Appellant provided the Respondent a letter resigning from full time employment, indicating that the new employment terms would be in accordance with the Employment Standards Act of Ontario, but that termination, notice and severance for his past employment would not form part of the new terms of employment.</P>
<P>7. After he provided this to the Respondent and had been working under these terms, he was presented with an employment contract dated July 24, 2013, purporting to apply retroactively to July 15, 2013, which indicated that &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.&rdquo;</P>
<P>8. When the Appellant's employment was terminated in January 2016, he was provided with three and a half weeks of working notice, two weeks of benefit continuation, and no severance pay, consistent with the waiver of termination and severance pay for years of service prior to July 15, 2013. He was advised by the Respondent that this was more than his <EM>Employment Standards Act</EM> entitlements.</P>
<P>9. The motion judge determined that the Appellant had nearly 30 years of continuous service at the time of his dismissal and that his <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements at the time were eight weeks of termination pay and 26 weeks of severance pay.</P>
<P>10. <STRIKE>The motion judge erred in mixed law and fact in failing to find that the Respondent intended that the Appellant resign from his employment, thus creating a break in service.</STRIKE> <UNDER>The motion judge erred in law by failing to determine that the agreed upon resignation from his full-time position to take on a part-time position entitled the Appellant to a common law entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment.</UNDER> In any case, she erred in law by failing to determine that the agreed upon waiver of termination and severance pay for previous years of service entitled him to a common law entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment, <UNDER>as did the agreement to provide him with his entitlements under the ESA from the start date of the part-time contract only.</UNDER></P>
<P>11. The motion judge erred in law in considering the parties' intentions to limit to <EM>ESA</EM> minimums <STRIKE>when such intention is void</STRIKE> in the face of an express contracting out of the legislation. <UNDER>She failed to consider their intention to contract out of the legislation.</UNDER></P>
<P>12. The motion judge erred in law in reviewing <UNDER>the historical termination provision</UNDER> <STRIKE>written terms of the contract</STRIKE> to determine the Plaintiff's entitlements, rather than the earlier negotiated terms. Or, in the alternative, the motion judge <STRIKE>erred in reviewing</STRIKE> <UNDER>failed to review</UNDER> the termination provision in the subsequent written contract in <STRIKE>isolation</STRIKE> <UNDER>the context</UNDER> of the waiver of termination and severance pay for previous years of service, and in <STRIKE>isolation</STRIKE> the context of the start date of the contract.</P>
<P>13. <UNDER>Alternatively,</UNDER> the motion judge erred in the determination that consideration was not relevant to the Appellant's termination entitlements. The Appellant was already working under agreed upon terms of part time employment by the time the written contract was presented to him. To the extent that the written contract had less favourable termination entitlements, which limited to statutory minimums only, <STRIKE>as the motion judge found</STRIKE>, <UNDER>which is denied</UNDER>, he received no consideration for accepting those terms.</P>
<P>14. The motion judge erred in allowing the Respondent to rely upon <UNDER>an unlawful contract</UNDER> a <STRIKE>termination provision</STRIKE> that they did not honour or intend to honour, particularly where <UNDER>the</UNDER> outcome was that the Appellant received less than his statutory minimum entitlements.</P>
<P>15. THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:
<P1>(a) Section 6(1)(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990 c.43;</P1>
<P1>(b) Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Order appealed from is final;</P1>
<P1>(d) Leave to appeal is not required.</P1></P>
<P>The Appellant requests that this appeal be heard at the Court of Appeal for Ontario, located at 130 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF CROSS-APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE RESPONDENT CROSS-APPEALS</BOLD> in this appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Justice Corthorn dated March 28, 2018, and asks that the judgment be varied to include the following:</P>
<P>1. The Appellant breached his obligation to mitigate his damages and, if the Appellant is entitled to damages in excess of his statutory entitlement, the damages must be reduced accordingly;</P>
<P>2. Had the Appellant been entitled to notice at common law of the termination of his employment, the reasonable notice period is not 22 months, but a lesser amount to account for the Appellant's failure to mitigate his damages;</P>
<P>3. An Order compelling the Appellant to pay to the Respondent its costs of the appeal and this cross-appeal on a substantial indemnity basis; and</P>
<P>4. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit be granted.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THIS CROSS-APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The motion judge held that the terms of the Appellant's contract of employment with the Respondent do not include entitlement to notice of termination of his employment without cause based on the common law, and that the Appellant was therefore entitled to his statutory entitlement of eight weeks' notice of the termination of his employment;</P>
<P>2. The motion judge erred in fact and in law in finding that, had the Appellant been entitled to common law notice of the termination of his employment, the reasonable notice period would be 22 months;</P>
<P>3. The motion judge erred in law by making a determination on the Appellant's reasonable notice period, had he been entitled to common law notice of the termination of his employment, but failing to address the issue of mitigation;</P>
<P>4. The motion judge erred in law and fact by failing to find that the Appellant breached his obligation to mitigate damages and by failing to reduce the damages to which the Appellant would be entitled to, if the damages exceeded his statutory entitlement; and</P>
<P>5. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>

<P1>Lawyers for the Defendant (Respondent), NORR Limited Architects and Engineers</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS</TI>
<P>1. In her Order dated March 28, 2018 from a summary judgment motion in the Superior Court of Justice, Corthorn J. found that the Appellant, John David Ariss (&ldquo;Ariss&rdquo;) had a statutory entitlement under the <EM>Employment Standards Act</EM> (&ldquo;<EM>ESA</EM>&rdquo;) to eight weeks of termination pay and 26 weeks of severance pay in connection with the termination of his employment with the Respondent employer, NORR Limited Architects and Engineers, (&ldquo;NORR&rdquo;); however, she found the presumption of reasonable notice of termination of employment had been rebutted.</P>
<P>2. In her subsequent Order of May 22, 2018, Corthorn J. awarded costs to Respondent in the amount of $20,390, in accordance with Rule 49.10(2) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> and the March 28, 2018 Order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Machtinger</EM> incorrectly applied</TI>
<P>3. In determining that the presumption of reasonable notice had been rebutted, the motion judge relied upon the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1992</YEAR><CITE>1992 CanLII 102</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Machtinger</EM>]</BOLD> for the principle that a reasonable notice entitlement is rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly specifies some other period of notice, expressly or impliedly. She reiterated reliance upon this decision in her costs endorsement of May 22, 2018.</P>
<P>4. The Appellant states that the motion judge erred in applying <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM></BOLD> by failing to consider the qualifying provisions therein that if the intention of the parties is to make an unlawful contract, no lawful contractual term can be derived from that intention and that if an employment contract fails to comply with the minimum statutory notice provisions of the <EM>ESA</EM>, then the presumption of reasonable notice will not have been rebutted.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Reasonable Notice Entitlement</TI>
<P>5. The Respondent would only move the Appellant from full-time to part-time employment if he: (a) agreed to resign from his full-time position; (b) agreed to waive his entitlement to termination and severance pay for his previous years of service; and (c) agreed to limit his entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM> to those accrued after the start date of the new part-time contract. The Appellant commenced part-time employment on July 15, 2013, and provided a letter confirming those terms on July 17, 2013:
<QUOTE><P>Please accept this letter as notice of my wishes to reduce my work week and resign from my full time position as Senior Architect from the NORR Kingston Office. This is conditional on acceptance of a new offer of employment for part time hours, conditions which have been discussed with and agreed to by Brian Gerstmar.</P>
<P>I understand that the new employment terms will be in accordance with the Employment Standards Act of Ontario. Termination, notice and severance for my past employment will not form part of the new terms of employment.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>6. He was subsequently provided a part-time employment contract with a retroactive start date of July 15, 2013, which stipulated that, &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.&rdquo; He signed on July 31, 2013.</P>
<P>7. The motion judge declined to determine whether the parties had agreed to terms of part-time employment prior to executing the 2013 employment contract and whether the contract had terms of dismissal that differed from the earlier negotiated terms.</P>
<P>8. Accepting the Respondent's evidence that the terms of employment were agreed upon before part-time work commenced, the negotiated terms of dismissal contracted out of the <EM>ESA</EM>. If the subsequent contract is seen to capture the same terms, then it must be read in the light of the start date for <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements being July 15, 2013, the resignation from full-time employment, and waiver of termination and severance pay for previous years of service provided by the Appellant. Both result in a reasonable notice entitlement.</P>
<P>9. If the subsequent contract captured different terms, and successfully rebuts the reasonable notice presumption, which we deny, then there was no consideration for its acceptance.</P>
<P>10. Upon his dismissal in January 2016, Ariss was provided three and a half weeks of termination pay, two weeks of benefits, and no severance pay and advised that he was being provided more than his statutory entitlements. This is consistent with NORR's reliance upon a resignation from his full-time position, waiver of termination and severance pay for years of service prior to July 2013, and the agreement to commence <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements as of July 15, 2013 only.</P>
<P>11. Corthorn J. ruled that he had continuous service with NORR commencing in 1986 and that the Respondent failed to provide him eight weeks' notice and 26 weeks' severance pay in accordance with the <EM>Employment Standards Act</EM>.</P>
<P>12. In her analysis of the parties' intentions, the motion judge reviewed earlier contracts between them as evidence that they wished to rebut the reasonable notice presumption; however this was done in error as she failed to consider the impact of the intention to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> and the act of so doing in 2013. In such case, a reasonable notice entitlement flows.</P>
<P>13. NORR intended to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> with respect to Ariss' entitlements upon dismissal, contracted out of the <EM>ESA</EM> with respect to Ariss' entitlements upon dismissal, provided less than Ariss' <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements upon his dismissal, and the only consequence to NORR was payment of those <EM>ESA</EM> minimum entitlements. This runs afoul of the principles articulated in <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM>.</BOLD></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<P>14. Ariss' service as an employee with NORR and its predecessors commenced in February 1986 and remained continuous throughout a sale of business and his transition from full-time to part-time employment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ariss v. NORR Limited Architects &amp; Engineers</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 620</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Judgment], para 39 and 96 at Appeal Book and Compendium [ABCO] Tab 7, p. 35 and 46.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The parties engaged in lengthy negotiations surrounding Ariss' transition from full-time to part-time employment in 2013. Notably, NORR refused to move Ariss to part-time employment unless he agreed to resign from his full-time position and waive termination and severance entitlements for his past years of employment. This is articulated repeatedly in the Respondent's evidence:
<QUOTE><P>NORR would not have agreed to the part-time employment agreement terms that it did with Mr. Ariss unless he agreed to resign and waive his past years of termination and severance entitlements.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Brian Gerstmar, sworn March 10, 2017, [Gerstmar Affidavit], para 13, at ABCO Tab 15, p. 146 and Exhibit Book [EB] Tab 3, p. 143.</BOLD></P1>
<QUOTE><P>I would never have agreed to the generous terms of his new part-time position if he had not agreed to resign and waive his past years of termination and severance entitlements.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Jacqui Souter, sworn March 10, 2017, [Souter Affidavit], para 24, at ABCO Tab 14, p. 116 and EB Tab 2, p. 68.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. This was relayed to Ariss before he started part-time work:
<QUOTE><P>In my e-mail, I made clear that NORR would only agree to Mr. Ariss' part-time work arrangement if he gave up any of his notice and severance entitlements for his past years of service with NORR, which was from November 2002 until May 2013. I also made clear in my email that, going forward as a part-time employee, Mr. Ariss would accrue notice and severance entitlements in accordance with the ESA.</P></QUOTE>

<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit Exhibit E, at ABCO Tab 14E, p. 122 and EB Tab 2E, p. 98 / Gerstmar Affidavit Exhibit B at ABCO Tab 15B, p. 148 and EB Tab 3B, p. 149.</BOLD></P1>
<QUOTE><P>I asked Mr. Gerstmar to call Mr. Ariss to make clear to Mr. Ariss that his transition to this new position would require his resignation and waiver of his past years' termination and severance entitlements. I believe that in late June 2013, Mr. Gerstmar conveyed this message to Mr. Ariss by phone.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit, para 18, at ABCO Tab 14, p. 114 and EB Tab 2, p. 66</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Judgment, para 57, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 40.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The parties contemplated providing Ariss with his entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM> commencing from the start date of his part-time employment only. While he sought in negotiations to change those terms, NORR was adamant that they were material:
<QUOTE><P>My transition to a reduction in work hours would not interrupt my continuous employment service for the purpose of maintaining company benefit entitlements and government regulated compensation rights, including severance and termination.</P>
<P><BOLD>Not Agreed</BOLD>&mdash;Since you are voluntarily retiring from your full time employment, you will no longer be eligible for any notice or severance pay for your years of service from November 2002 to May 2013. You will accrue years of service for notice and severance in accordance with the Employment Standards Act, as of your casual start date of July 1<SUP>st</SUP> 2013.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit Exhibit E, at ABCO Tab 14E, p. 122 and EB Tab 2E, p. 98 / Gerstmar Affidavit Exhibit B at ABCO Tab 15B, p. 148 and EB Tab 3B, p. 149.</BOLD></P1>

<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 55 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 39.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Ariss understood that NORR would not do a deal to allow him to work part-time unless he started &ldquo;fresh:&rdquo;
<QUOTE><P>Q. That was the position that NORR was taking. They said, &ldquo;We're not prepared to continue to honour your service. You had to start fresh if you were going to go to part-time.&rdquo; The service entitlements accrual would begin when you started part-time. That was NORR's position, correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. You understood that that position was being conveyed in a way that was not negotiable as of July 4, 2013, correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes</P></QUOTE>

<QUOTE><P>Q. You understood that unless you resigned and agreed that for the purpose of any notice, it started again with the new position starting date, the new part-time position starting date?</P>
<P>A. That was their position.</P>
<P>Q. And you understood, I'm going to put to you one more thing, you understood that they would not agree to do a part-time deal with you unless you agreed to those terms, correct?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Cross, P. 32; Q. 198, 199, at ABCO Tab 11, p. 76 and EB Tab 7, p. 212.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Accepting the Respondent's evidence that all terms of the move to part-time employment were agreed upon by July 11, 2013, including his agreement to resign from his full-time position, Ariss then commenced part-time work on July 15, 2013.

<P>20. Consistent with the parties' agreement, Ariss provided NORR with a letter at their request stating the following on July 17, 2013:
<QUOTE><P>Please accept this letter as notice of my wishes to reduce my work week and resign from my full time position as Senior Architect from the NORR Kingston Office. This is conditional on acceptance of a new offer of employment for part time hours, conditions which have been discussed with and agreed to by Brian Gerstmar.</P>
<P>I understand that the new employment terms will be in accordance with the Employment Standards Act of Ontario. Termination, notice and severance for my past employment will not form part of the new terms of employment.</P></QUOTE>

<P>21. Ariss subsequently was provided a contract with a retroactive start date of July 15, 2013, which he signed on July 31, 2013. It read in part: &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit para 23, 24 at ABCO Tab 12, p. 80, 81 and EB Tab 1, p. 4, 5.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit Exhibit F, at ABCO Tab 12F, p. 92 and EB Tab 1F, p. 26.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit Exhibit H, at ABCO Tab 14H, p. 136 and EB Tab 2H, p. 112.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 68, 69 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 42.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. The motion judge looked at the &ldquo;historical termination provision&rdquo; in contracts that the parties negotiated in 2002 and 2006 to demonstrate an ongoing intention that the reasonable notice presumption be rebutted.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 77, 78, 79, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 43, 44.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Neither the negotiations respecting the move to part-time work, nor the subsequent contract that followed made express reference to the &ldquo;historical termination provision,&rdquo; consisting of a chart of termination entitlements described by the motion judge.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 79 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 44.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit Exhibit F at ABCO Tab 12F, p. 92 and EB Tab 1F, p. 26.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit Exhibit I, at ABCO Tab 14I, p. 140 and EB Tab 2I, p. 116.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. Due to her finding on the clarity of the historical termination provision in limiting to the minimum entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM>, the motion judge did not determine whether the negotiated terms of part-time employment and the subsequent contract contained the same terms. Accordingly, she did not determine which terms governed Ariss' employment upon dismissal, or determine whether consideration flowed if there was a legal waiver of reasonable notice entitlements in the July 31, 2013 contract, which is denied.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 80, 81, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 44.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. Upon his dismissal in January 2016, NORR gave Ariss 3.5 weeks' notice of termination and offered to continue Ariss' benefits for a period of two weeks following the effective date of termination. NORR did not provide Ariss with severance pay.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 11, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 29.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit Exhibit K, at ABCO Tab 12K, p. 96 and EB Tab 1K, p. 30.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. In 2016, NORR was of the view that (a) Ariss was entitled to only two weeks' notice pursuant to the <EM>ESA</EM>, and (b) it had, by giving Ariss 3.5 weeks' notice, exceeded its statutory obligation for notice of termination.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 13 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 30.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit para 30 at ABCO Tab 14, p. 117 and EB Tab 2, p. 69.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Ariss' actual statutory entitlements amounted to eight weeks of termination pay and 26 weeks of severance pay, based on nearly 30 years of continuous service.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 117 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 49.</BOLD></P1></P>

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Standard of Review</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>34. As she looked only at the legal question of whether or not the parties intended to limit the Appellant's entitlements upon dismissal, the motion judge did not look at qualifying legal questions of whether or not the parties intended to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> and whether they did so. In order to determine those qualifying questions of law, facts that were before the judge, and which are not materially in dispute, must be applied. To make the determination of whether the parties contracted out of the <EM>ESA</EM>, the Court may be required to make a legal finding on consideration based on those facts; the motion judge declined to make this determination in light of her findings on the first question.</P>
<P>35. In the context of contractual interpretation, &ldquo;the application of an incorrect principle, the failure to consider a required element of a legal test, or the failure to consider a relevant factor&rdquo; has been characterized as an error of law. The failure to consider relevant factors in the determination of whether or not the reasonable notice presumption has been rebutted, as outlined in <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM>,</BOLD> falls into this category, attracting a correctness standard of review.

<P>36. While this appeal raises questions of mixed fact and law, which standard of review falls on a spectrum between correctness and overriding error, it can be seen as primarily an error of law.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Housen</EM> para 8 and 36.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. The instant matter can be characterized as having extricable errors of law in the failure to consider whether the parties intended to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> and whether the termination entitlements contracted out of the <EM>ESA visa-vis</EM> the facts, confirming the correctness standard.

<P>39. If necessary to determine, the issue of whether the negotiated terms of employment or the subsequent contract applies is a mixed fact and law question; however the question of consideration is a legal one and the motion judge declined to rule on it, rendering it primarily an error of law.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Machtinger summarized</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>40. <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM></BOLD> characterizes the common law principle of termination only on reasonable notice as a presumption, rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly specifies some other period of notice, whether expressly or impliedly. However, the decision clarifies that if the parties intended to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> and / or did so, the reasonable notice presumption will not be rebutted. Such is the case in this matter.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Minimum Entitlements</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>41. Contracting out of the minimum termination entitlements under the <EM>Employment Standards Act</EM> renders those provisions void:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>5.</N><SECP>(1) Subject to subsection (2), no employer or agent of an employer and no employee or agent of an employee shall contract out of or waive an employment standard and any such contracting out or waiver is void.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE>

<P>42. NORR asked Ariss to contract out of his minimum entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM> respecting termination and severance entitlements in multiple ways, as is evident from the language used in the judgment:
<QUOTE><P>Souter asks Gerstmar to call Ariss and tell him that NORR will not agree to the change from a full-time to a part-time position unless Ariss <BOLD><EM>both</EM></BOLD> resigns from his full-time position <BOLD><EM>and</EM></BOLD> waives his past years' termination and severance entitlement. (emphasis added).</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 57, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 40.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. NORR also confirmed the requirement that Ariss had to &ldquo;start fresh&rdquo; if he was going to go part-time and that service entitlements accrual would begin when he started part-time.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Cross P. 28, Q 178, at ABCO Tab 11, p. 75 and EB Tab 7, p. 208.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. Corthorn J. articulated NORR's goal in their requirement for him to resign from his full-time position: &ldquo;to establish an end to Ariss' employment in 2013, breaking his years of continuous service, and beginning new employment on a part-time basis.&rdquo; This demonstrates an intention to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> notice of termination entitlements under s. 57. They attempted to create a break in his service when there was none and only provide notice under the <EM>ESA</EM> from the start date of the new contract in 2013.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment paras 93, 94, 96, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 46.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>ESA</EM>, s. 57 at Appendix B.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>45. A waiver of termination and severance pay for previous years of service has greater consequences upon minimum <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements than the break of service that NORR sought in Ariss' resignation from his full-time position; severance pay flows even in the event of a break in service:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>65.</N><SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>All time spent by the employee in the employer's employ, whether or not continuous and whether or not active, shall be included in determining whether he or she is eligible for severance pay under subsection 64 (1) and in calculating his or her severance pay under subsection (1).</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>ESA</EM>, s. 65 (2), at Appendix B.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>46. By insisting he waive termination and severance pay for previous years of service, NORR was asking Ariss to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM>. Specifically, NORR intended to contract out of s. 57 regarding notice of termination and s. 65 regarding severance pay. Even if Ariss had resigned in the legal sense in 2013, and had no credit for years of service prior to the sale of business, which was not found to be the case, he would still have an entitlement to severance pay at the time. He was asked to waive it.

<P>47. &ldquo;If the intention of the parties is to make an unlawful contract, no lawful contractual term can be derived from their intention.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM> p. 1001.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>48. The Court has the benefit of NORR's evidence that they intended that Ariss' new terms of employment would not include termination and severance pay for years of service prior to July 2013 and that they would not have done the deal to allow him to assume part-time employment in the absence of those terms and a resignation from his full-time position. Effectively, they intended to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM>. No clause limiting their entitlements to the minimums under the <EM>ESA</EM> can arise in the circumstances.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Contracting out of ESA</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>49. Not only did the parties intend to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM>, thus preventing the finding that they are limited to <EM>ESA</EM> minimums only, they did contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM>.</P>
<P>50. &ldquo;In my view, an approach more consistent with the objects of the Act is that, if an employment contract fails to comply with the minimum statutory notice provisions of the Act, then the presumption of reasonable notice will not have been rebutted.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Machtinger p. 1004.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>51. Corthorn J. did not make an express determination about whether the negotiations for part-time work in 2013 or the contract that followed the commencement of that work governed Ariss' employment at the time of his dismissal.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 78, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>52. If the negotiated terms govern, which were determined by July 11, 2013, including the agreement to resign from his full-time position, waive termination and severance pay for previous years of service, and commence <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements as of the start date of part-time work only, then there is a reasonable notice entitlement due to the failure to comply with the minimum statutory provisions of the <EM>ESA</EM>. Ariss met these requirements and confirmed these terms by providing his July 17, 2013 resignation letter.
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit para 20, at ABCO Tab 14, p. 114 and EB Tab 2, p. 66.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit Exhibit E, at ABCO Tab 12E, p. 90 and EB Tab 1E, p. 24.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>53. If the subsequent written contract signed July 31, 2013 governs, then it must capture the negotiated terms. It should be read as providing the minimum notice under the <EM>ESA</EM> from the start date of the contract, which is offside the legislation for failing to recognize previous years of service. It must also be read in the context of the July 17, 2013 letter that Ariss provided, acting upon the negotiated terms, which stipulated that he was resigning from his full-time employment and that termination and severance pay for past years of service would not form part of the terms of his new contract of employment.

<P>54. Corthorn J. found that she need not determine the issue of consideration for rebutting the reasonable notice entitlement on account of her findings of intention to do so based on the historical termination provision. If the negotiated terms and the terms of the written contract differ, then consideration is relevant.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment paras 80, 81, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 44.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>55. The Respondent's evidence is that all terms of Ariss' part-time work were agreed upon by July 11, 2013, including the agreement to resign from his full-time position. Ariss commenced part-time work on July 15, 2013, in consideration for agreeing to those terms. Acting upon the negotiated terms, Ariss provided his July 17, 2013 resignation letter. It is these terms that governed.

<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit Exhibit E, at ABCO Tab 12E, p. 90 and EB Tab 1E, p. 24.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. It wasn't until July 23, 2013, after he had been working under those terms of part-time employment, and after providing his July 17, 2013 resignation letter, that Ariss was presented an employment contract with a retroactive start date to July 15, 2013, that stated, &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.&rdquo; He signed it on July 31, 2013.

<P>57. Though we state it is evident the parties contracted out of the <EM>ESA</EM> and relied upon it, if the employment contract subsequently executed on July 31, 2013 is seen on its face to properly limit termination entitlements, it cannot stand for lack of consideration, as the earlier negotiated terms give rise to a reasonable notice entitlement.

<P>58. Such was the case in <BOLD><EM>Holland</EM>,</BOLD> where a contract purporting to limit termination entitlements to the minimums under the <EM>ESA</EM> was presented to an employee after he had started working on the basis of negotiated terms, including an entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment. The subsequent contract could not limit entitlements to the minimums under the <EM>ESA</EM> for lack of consideration:
<QUOTE><P>Without fresh consideration, the Employment Agreement could not displace the implied term of reasonable notice contained in the Offer Letter. The result is that the appellant was entitled to reasonable notice of termination at common law.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Holland</EM> at para 15.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>59. To the extent that the subsequent contract in isolation is seen to limit to the minimum entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM> and not contract out of those entitlements, which we deny, then there was no consideration for agreeing to less favourable terms of employment that limited entitlements upon dismissal to those under the <EM>ESA</EM>. A reasonable notice entitlement flows.

<P>60. Consistent with their stated intentions and actions, NORR provided less than Ariss' minimum entitlements when they terminated his employment without cause in January 2016.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 11, 117, at ABCO Tab 7, p. 29, 49.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. Upon Ariss' dismissal, NORR believed he had only a two week notice of termination entitlement&mdash;consistent with counting years of service only from July 2013 to January 2016 and waiving termination pay for previous years of service. They believed he had no severance entitlement&mdash;consistent with a waiver of severance pay for years of service prior to July 2013. NORR acted upon the negotiated terms.

<P1><BOLD><EM>ESA</EM>, s. 57, 64, 65, at Appendix B.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>62. NORR took the position upon dismissal that Ariss' years of continuous service ended in 2013 and that he had no severance entitlement, but then in turn obtained the benefit as if they had drafted a valid termination provision that limited to <EM>ESA</EM> only. It was not their intention to provide him his actual <EM>ESA</EM> entitlement and they did not so do.

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Error in Finding Reasonable Notice Presumption Rebutted</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>63. While the intention of NORR may have been to rebut the reasonable notice presumption, they cannot succeed in doing so where they intended to contract out of the provisions of the <EM>ESA</EM> respecting termination and severance pay, did so, and then relied on that contracting out:
<QUOTE><P>In argument, the respondent accepted that the attempt to contract out of the provisions of the Act was &ldquo;null and void&rdquo;, but argued that the documents should be considered as evidence &ldquo;that contracts were entered into which expressed clearly the intention of the parties with respect to notice of termination.&rdquo; I cannot accept this argument.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Machtinger p. 928.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>64. This is where Corthorn J. erred. She looked at the intention of the parties to provide minimum entitlements under the <EM>ESA</EM> by reviewing the &ldquo;historical termination provision&rdquo; in Ariss' earlier contracts with NORR in 2002 and 2006 rather than the terms agreed upon in his negotiations for part-time work in 2013. NORR did not ultimately use the &ldquo;historical termination provision&rdquo; in 2013, but chose different language that did not comply with minimum entitlements.

<P>65. To allow the consequence to NORR for contracting out of the <EM>ESA</EM> to be payment of the <EM>ESA</EM> creates troubling policy issues:
<QUOTE><P>If the only sanction which employers potentially face for failure to comply with the minimum notice periods prescribed by the Act is an order that they minimally comply with the Act, employers will have little incentive to make contracts with their employees that comply with the Act.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Machtinger p. 1004.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>66. It was open to NORR to negotiate terms of part-time employment that limited to the <EM>ESA</EM>, by simply inserting the same &ldquo;historical termination provision&rdquo; that had been in every other contract they had with Ariss into a part-time contract, but they did not do so. They insisted on a resignation from full-time employment and a waiver of termination and severance pay for previous years of service, and a start date for <EM>ESA</EM> entitlements as of the start date of the part-time contract. These terms were offside the legislation and cannot govern:
<QUOTE><P>An employer who wishes to guard against being called upon to give any more notice or severance pay than legislation demands can readily draw a contractual clause which, in effect, converts the statutory floor into a ceiling. But here the employer has authored a contractual term which simply fails to comply with the law. In such circumstances, it is not evident why the employee should be placed in a worse position than if the contract had said nothing at all about notice of termination.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Machtinger p. 1005.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>67. If employers are able to contract out of the <EM>ESA</EM> with minimal consequence, mistakenly or not, the impact on employees is substantial:
<QUOTE><P>Employers can rely on the fact that many employees will not challenge contractual notice provisions which are in fact contrary to employment standards legislation. Employers such as the present respondent can contract with their employees for notice periods below the statutory minimum, knowing that only those individual employees who take legal action after they are dismissed will in fact receive the protection of the minimum statutory notice provisions.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Machtinger p. 1004.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>68. This was the position that Ariss found himself in. Corthorn J. acknowledged as much in her Costs endorsement:
<QUOTE><P>NORR's position is that the approach taken at the time of Ariss' termination was based on its &ldquo;understanding of the duration of Mr. Ariss' employment at the time.&rdquo; NORR's approach was found to be in error. In the context of the determination of costs, NORR cannot rely on an erroneous approach in that regard. It is specifically because of NORR's approach that Ariss was required to pursue the matter as far as he did.</P>
<P>Had Ariss not pursued the matter, he would have been denied the compensation to which he was entitled after a career of several decades at NORR and its predecessor company.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Machtinger Applied</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>69. The Divisional Court in 2016 confirmed the approach in <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM></BOLD> that if s. 5 of the <EM>ESA</EM> (s. 3 at the time <BOLD><EM>Machtinger</EM></BOLD> was decided) is breached with respect to entitlements upon dismissal, then reasonable notice applies:
<QUOTE><P>If the termination provision is not onside with notice provisions and severance provisions (if applicable) of the Act at the outset, then it is void and unenforceable.

<P1><BOLD><EM>Garreton</EM> at paras 18, 27, 28.</BOLD></P1></P>

<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Costs</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>71. As the Respondent's Rule 49 Offer was greater than the amount awarded in the Judgment, Corthorn J. ordered the Respondent to pay partial indemnity to the Appellant to the date of their offer to settle and ordered the Appellant to pay to the Respondent partial indemnity costs thereafter. The net result was an Order for the Appellant to pay $20,390 to the Respondent.

Instead, the Appellant should be entitled to partial indemnity costs to the date of his offer on October 12, 2016, which is $7,652.49, and substantial indemnity costs thereafter in the amount of $46,995.40, for a total costs award in the first instance pursuant to Rule 49.10(1) of $54,647.89.

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANT (RESPONDENT, APPELLANT IN CROSS APPEAL)</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. This appeal and cross-appeal arise from a summary judgment motion brought by the plaintiff, John David Ariss <BOLD>(&ldquo;Ariss&rdquo;)</BOLD> against his former employer, NORR Limited Architects and Engineers <BOLD>(&ldquo;NORR&rdquo;)</BOLD> for determination of his claim of wrongful dismissal.</P>
<P>2. The termination provision in Ariss' contract of employment with NORR limits Ariss' entitlements to the minimums specified by the <EM>Employment Standards Act, 2002</EM>, S.O. 2000, c. 41 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;ESA&rdquo;</BOLD>). The motion judge held, among other things, that the termination provision is sufficiently clear and unambiguous, and rebuts the common law presumption of reasonable notice of the termination of his employment.</P>
<P>3. The motion judge correctly applied the legal principles outlined in <CASEREF><SOC>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 986</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Machtinger</EM>&rdquo;), which provide that the presumption of common law reasonable notice upon termination of employment is rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly specifies some other period of notice that complies with the ESA. The motion judge's findings are entitled to deference and can only be interfered with in cases of palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>4. The motion judge's decision is proper for the following reasons:
<P1>(a) Ariss' written employment contract clearly limits his entitlements upon termination of his employment to the ESA minimums;</P1>
<P1>(b) Ariss' written employment contract does not contain language that purports to waive any entitlements to employment standards protected by the ESA;</P1>
<P1>(c) the enforceability of a termination clause depends only on the wording of the clause itself;</P1>
<P1>(d) the motion judge made a finding of fact that Ariss fully understood, at all times during his employment with NORR, that his entitlements on the termination of his employment would be in accordance with the ESA;</P1>
<P1>(e) the motion judge considered Ariss and NORR's agreement that Ariss would resign in 2013 upon transitioning to part-time hours and held that there was no interruption in the continuity of Ariss' employment with NORR, and that the resignation was not successful; and</P1>
<P1>(f) the alleged &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; of Ariss' termination and severance pay for his past years' of service was a result of Ariss' purported resignation, and, accordingly, was also not successful and has no effect.</P1></P>
<P>5. Ariss has not demonstrated or alleged palpable and overriding error in the motion judge's decision. NORR submits that Ariss' appeal should be denied.</P>
<P>6. If this Court finds that the motion judge erred in finding that Ariss was limited to the minimum ESA entitlements, then NORR cross-appeals and submits that the motion judge erred by failing to consider the issue of mitigation. Ariss has a duty to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his damages and reduce the amount payable by NORR, but his mitigation efforts are minimal and insufficient. In such circumstances, reasonable notice becomes a triable issue that is not appropriate for summary judgment. The motion judge's decision not to consider the issue of mitigation is reviewable on a correctness standard. It is appropriate for this Court to interfere with the motion judge's decision not to consider Ariss' failure to mitigate.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Ariss' Employment With NORR</EM></TI>
<P>7. Ariss was hired as an architect by a company located in Kingston, Ontario in 1986. Upon the sale of the company's business assets to NORR in November 2002, Ariss was hired by NORR as a full-time Senior Architect.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ariss v NORR Limited Architects and Engineers</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 620</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Judgment],</BOLD> paras 4-5, at Ariss' Appeal Book and Compendium <BOLD>[ABCO],</BOLD> Tab 7, p 29.</P1>

<P>8. Ariss' contract with NORR (the <BOLD>&ldquo;2002 Contract&rdquo;</BOLD>) contains terms which limit Ariss' termination entitlements to ESA minimums.
<P1>Affidavit of John David Ariss sworn January 9, 2017 <BOLD>[Ariss Affidavit],</BOLD> Exhibit C, at Compendium, Tab 1-C, pp 14&ndash;16.</P1>

<P>9. In 2006, Ariss requested and receive an increase in hours and signed an amendment to his contract to that effect (the <BOLD>&ldquo;2006 Amendment&rdquo;</BOLD>). As in the 2002 Contract, the 2006 Amendment contains terms which limited Ariss' termination entitlements to ESA minimums. The termination provision states that notice will be provided &ldquo;in accordance with the Ontario Employment Standards Act&rdquo; and includes a chart that specifically lists the notice period for each period of employment.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, paras 9&ndash;11, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 45.</P1>
<P1>Ariss Affidavit, Exhibit D, at Compendium, Tab 1-D, pp 18&ndash;22.</P1></P>
<P>10. On cross-examination, Ariss confirmed that he had read the terms when he signed the 2006 Amendment and that he understood at that time that it limited his termination entitlements to ESA minimums.
<P1>Ariss Cross-Examination, pp 19-20, Q 121&ndash;127, at Compendium, Tab 5, pp 133-134.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Transition to Part-Time Hours</EM></TI>
<P>11. In February 2013, Ariss approached NORR with a desire to transition to part-time hours. On May 31, 2013, Ariss made a written request to NORR to transition to part-time hours and proposed revisions to his contract of employment with NORR.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, paras 13-14 at Compendium, Tab 2, p 46.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit C, at Compendium, Tab 2-C, p 69&ndash;71.</P1></P>
<P>12. NORR considered Ariss' proposal and raised a number of concerns. The primary concern was that Ariss would not be effective in a part-time role. As a Senior Architect, Ariss was responsible for managing projects and communicating with clients. In NORR's view, it would be difficult to satisfy NORR's demanding clients when working part-time hours. Furthermore, NORR had no one to take over Ariss' responsibilities in the office on days when he was not working. Another concern was that the terms of Ariss' proposal were too similar to what full-time NORR employees received.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, paras 16 and 19, at Compendium, Tab 2, pp 47-48.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit D, at Compendium, Tab 2 -D, pp 73-74.</P1>
<P1>Affidavit of Brian Gerstmar sworn March 10, 2017 <BOLD>[Gerstmar Affidavit],</BOLD> paras 3, 5, and 10, at Compendium, Tab 3, pp 108, 110.</P1>
<P1>Gerstmar Affidavit, Exhibit C, at Compendium, Tab 3-C, pp 113&ndash;116.</P1></P>
<P>13. However, NORR thought that Ariss could still make a valuable contribution to its Kingston office. To satisfy the concerns and priorities of both parties, Ariss and NORR agreed that Ariss would resign. Ariss' resignation would mean that his past years of service would not be counted in future calculations of his entitlements should his employment be terminated. However, the motion judge found that the parties were not successful in the attempt to effect a resignation.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, para 17, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 47.</P1>
<P1>Gerstmar Affidavit, paras 10&ndash;13, at Compendium, Tab 3, p .</P1>

<P1>Judgment, paras 93&ndash;96, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 46.</P1></P>
<P>14. Though Ariss submitted a resignation letter to NORR, there was no break in his employment with NORR. The motion judge made a finding of fact that there was no interruption in the continuity of Ariss' employment, and therefore no effective resignation or waiver of his termination or severance entitlements under the ESA for his past years of service.
<P1>Ariss Affidavit, Exhibit E, at Compendium, Tab 1-E, p 24.</P1>
<P1>Judgment, paras 93&ndash;96, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 46.</P1></P>
<P>15. NORR and Ariss agreed on the compensation terms of his transition to part-time hours by July 11, 2013, and Ariss was presented with a written document to that effect on July 23, 2013, which he signed on July 31, 2013 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;2013 Amendment&rdquo;</BOLD>).
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit D, at Compendium, Tab 2-D, pp 73-74.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit E, at Compendium, Tab 2-E, pp 76&ndash;82.</P1>
<P1>Gerstmar Affidavit, para 11, at Compendium, Tab 3, p 110.</P1>
<P1>Gerstmar Affidavit, Exhibit C, at Compendium, Tab 3-C, pp 113&ndash;116.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, paras 25-26, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 50.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit H, at Compendium, Tab 2-H, pp 84&ndash;87.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit I, at Compendium, Tab 2-I, pp 89-90.</P1></P>
<P>16. The termination provision in the 2013 Amendment is consistent with the termination provisions in the 2002 Contract and 2006 Amendment, and states; &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.&rdquo; The termination provision complies with the ESA and does not waive any of Ariss' entitlements to termination or severance pay under the ESA.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit I, at Compendium, Tab 2-I, pp 89-90.</P1>
<P1>Judgment, paras 75 and 77, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 43.</P1></P>
<P>17. The 2013 Amendment also includes the following paragraph:
<QUOTE><P>This offer of employment contains all relevant and material terms of your employment with NORR. If you believe that any oral commitments have been made to you that are not contained herein, you must bring them to the attention of the undersigned representative of NORR without delay. Any such commitments are neither valid nor binding unless confirmed and documented by the undersigned representative of NORR.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit I, at Compendium, Tab 2-I, pp 89-90.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Termination of Ariss' Employment</EM></TI>
<P>18. NORR's Kingston office was primarily focused on correctional and government service projects. In late 2012 or early 2013, NORR lost a standing service agreement that had allowed it to bid or participate in government projects. NORR's efforts to resolve this issue in 20 14 and 2015 were unsuccessful. This had a significant negative effect on the financial health of NORR's Kingston office and it created a severe shortage of work. For these reasons, NORR notified Ariss on January 26, 20 16 that his employment with NORR would be terminated effective February 19, 2016.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, paras 28&ndash;30, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 51.</P1>
<P1>Gerstmar Affidavit, para 15, at Compendium, Tab 3, p 111.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Ariss' Failure to Mitigate</EM></TI>
<P>19. Ariss has not taken reasonable steps to find alternate employment since his dismissal. Ariss has made minimal efforts to find a new position in Kingston (the city where he resides). Ariss has not sought the assistance of a recruitment agency or taken courses to update his skills&mdash;for example, by learning basic architecture software, which he knows would make him more marketable.
<P1>Ariss Cross-Examination, pp 60&ndash;64, Q 379&ndash;401, at Compendium, Tab 5, pp 157&ndash;161.</P1></P>
<P>20. Furthermore, Ariss has almost exclusively searched for jobs in Kingston, which is a very small architecture market. Ariss has acknowledged that by December 20 16, he knew it was unlikely that he would get a job in Kingston as an architect, yet he did not expand his search.
<P1>Ariss Cross-Examination, p 52, Q 318; p 57, Q 354&ndash;359; p 61, Q 385, at Compendium, Tab 5, pp 153-154, 158.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, para 37, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 53.</P1></P>
<P>21. NORR has shown that suitable job opportunities have been available to Ariss in Ottawa. Ariss has admitted to seeing job opportunities that he is likely qualified for, but the opportunities are located outside of Kingston and Ariss has not applied for any of the opportunities. In addition, Ariss did not broaden his search beyond architectural positions.
<P1>Souter Affidavit, para 38, at Compendium, Tab 2, p 54.</P1>
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit L, at Compendium, Tab 2-L, pp 92&ndash;106.</P1>
<P1>Ariss Cross-Examination, pp 57-58, Q 361&ndash;364; pp 64&ndash;66, Q 402&ndash;418, at Compendium, Tab 5, pp 154-155, 161&ndash;163.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Motion Judge's Decision</EM></TI>
<P>22. Ariss commenced an action against NORR for wrongful dismissal and moved for summary judgment. The motion judge concluded that the issues were capable of determination on the motion and a trial was not required. Success on the motion was divided. The motion judge applied the principles outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Machtinger</EM>, and held, among other things, that Ariss' entitlement to notice upon the termination of his employment was restricted to the provisions of the ESA because of the termination provision in his written employment agreement.
<P1>Judgment, para 82, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 44.</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;POSITION ON ISSUES</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>APPEAL ISSUE ONE: The motion judge properly held that Ariss is entitled to notice of termination of his employment in accordance with the ESA.</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</TI>
<P>23. The interpretation of a contractual clause is entitled to deference from an appellate court and should not be overturned absent palpable and overriding error, unless an error of law can be extricated from the motion judge's interpretation of the clause.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Creston Moly Corp v Sattva Capital Corp</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>50, 52</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wood v Fred Deeley</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 158</CITE><PARANUM>43</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Wood</EM>]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. Palpable and overriding error means &ldquo;clearly wrong&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;not reasonably supported by the evidence&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Garreton v Complete Innovations Inc</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 1178</CITE><COURTJUR>Div Ct</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para 13 <BOLD>[<EM>Garreton</EM>]</BOLD>, citing <CASEREF><SOC>L (H) v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2005] 1 SCR 401</CITE><PARANUM>110</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>25. Ariss refers to <EM>Garreton</EM> to argue that the correctness standard is applicable to the issues raised in this appeal. In <EM>Garreton</EM>, the trial judge held that it was not necessary to determine whether the employment agreement was unenforceable and whether the termination clause was void from the outset. The appellate court found that the trial judge erred in law in failing to deal with the issue of whether the employment agreement, and specifically the termination clause, was void and unenforceable. The court applied a correctness standard.
<P1><EM>Garreton</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 24, at paras 14&ndash;17.</P1></P>
<P>26. <EM>Garreton</EM> is distinguishable from Ariss' appeal. In Ariss' case, the motion judge did not fail to consider the enforceability of the termination provision. Instead, the motion judge specifically considered the issue and found that the termination provision is enforceable and rebuts the presumption of common law reasonable notice of the termination of Ariss' employment.
<P1>Judgment, paras 73&ndash;82, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 43-44.</P1></P>
<P>27. NORR submits that there is no extricable legal error in the motion judge's analysis and the standard of review is palpable and overriding error.</P></BLOCK3>

<P>28. The motion judge properly held that Ariss is entitled to notice of termination in accordance with the ESA. The motion judge correctly applied the legal principles out lined in <EM>Machtinger</EM>.</P>
<P>29. <EM>Machtinger</EM> explains that the common law principle of termination only on reasonable notice is a presumption, and is rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly specifies some other period of notice, whether expressly or impliedly. However, if an employment contract fails to comply with the minimum statutory provisions of the ESA, then that portion of the contract will be null and void, and the presumption of reasonable notice will not have been rebutted.
<P1><EM>Machtinger</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 3, at paras 20, 26, 34.</P1></P>
<P>30. The motion judge stated that in the 2002 Contract and 2006 Amendment, the termination and severance provisions referred only to the ESA. The motion judge properly held that the language used in the termination provision is clear and unambiguous in rebutting the common law presumption of reasonable notice. Ariss has not alleged that the motion judge erred in this determination.
<P1>Judgment, paras 28, 46, 69, 74, and 77, at ABCO, Tab 7, pp 34, 37, 42, 43.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Ariss Did Not Waive His Past Years' Termination and Severance Pay</EM></TI>
<P>31. Despite the discussions between the parties when negotiating Ariss' transition to part-time hours, or the language in the emails or in Ariss' purported resignation letter, the motion judge found that:
<P1>(a) NORR was not successful in establishing an end to Ariss' employment, breaking his years of continuous service, or beginning new employment on a part-time basis;</P1>
<P1>(b) Ariss did not resign; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Ariss' service was continuous from 1986 to 2016 with no interruption.
<P2>Judgment, para 93&ndash;96, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 46.</P2></P1></P>
<P>32. These findings are grounded in the evidence and this Court cannot interfere in the absence of palpable and overriding error. No such error has been demonstrated.</P>
<P>33. The motion judge properly found that the events in 2013 were an amendment to the terms of Ariss' employment with NORR. The events in 2013 are similar to the 2006 Amendment, where Ariss increased his weekly hours and modified his compensation and benefits accordingly. After transitioning to part-time hours in 2013, Ariss performed the same role as when he worked full-time hours. It was only the number of weekly hours, compensation, and benefits that were modified. The modifications were outlined in the 2013 Amendment.
<P1>Judgment, para 95, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 46.</P1></P>
<P>34. Even if the intention of a formal resignation and resulting waiver of past years' termination and severance pay was clear, the requested resignation and waiver has no effect and cannot be relied upon. The motion judge correctly referred to <CASEREF><SOC>Riskie v. Sony Canada Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 5859</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Riskie</EM>&rdquo;), to explain that, even if NORR intended that Ariss resign from his employment with NORR, such request would be &ldquo;an entirely artificial attempt to create an interruption in employment when in fact there was none.&rdquo; The motion judge in <EM>Riskie</EM> held that the formal resignation of an employee, who was transitioning from an employment contract of indefinite duration to a fixed-term contract, was a &ldquo;red herring&rdquo; and had &ldquo;no practical effect even if the intention was clear enough&rdquo;.
<P1>Judgment, para 95, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 46.</P1>
<P1><EM>Riskie</EM>, at paras 27, 54.</P1></P>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Terms of Ariss' Contract of Employment</EM></TI>
<P>35. Given that Ariss' years of continuous service were not interrupted in 2013, the motion judge properly found that the terms of employment to which Ariss was asked to agree in 2013 were no different than the terms to which he had agreed in both 2002 and 2006. These terms include the termination provision, which the motion judge found to be clear and unambiguous in rebutting the common law presumption. The termination provision complied with the ESA and did not waive any of Ariss' entitlements to termination or severance pay under the ESA.
<P1>Judgment, paras 74, 77, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 43.</P1></P>
<P>36. Whether or not the 2013 Amendment used the same language for the termination provision as the 2002 Contract and 2006 Amendment is not material. The termination provision in the 2013 Amendment is consistent with the historical termination provisions, and is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to rebut the common law presumption. The provision states: &ldquo;Either party may terminate this agreement by providing the minimum notice required under the <EM>Employment Standards Act of Ontario</EM>.&rdquo;
<P1>Souter Affidavit, Exhibit I, at Compendium, Tab 2-I, pp 89-90.</P1></P>
<P>37. <EM>Machtinger</EM> held that an employment contract can &ldquo;referentially incorporate the minimum notice periods set out in the Act&rdquo; and that this would be &ldquo;sufficient to displace the presumption&rdquo; of a common law reasonable notice period. The termination provision in the 2013 Amendment explicitly directs Ariss to the ESA and complies with the ESA's minimum entitlements. Further, the 20 13 Amendment states that any other terms are &ldquo;neither valid nor binding unless confirmed and documented&rdquo; by NORR. No additional terms were documented. The motion judge did not err in the interpretation of the termination provision or in holding that Ariss was only entitled to notice of termination in accordance with the ESA.
<P1><EM>Machtinger</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 3, at para 35.</P1>
<P1><EM>ESA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 2, at s 57.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Ariss Understood That Termination Entitlements Were Limited to ESA Minimums</EM></TI>
<P>38. Additionally, the motion judge drew an inference and found:
<QUOTE><P>in 2013, when negotiating the terms of his contract for casual employment, Ariss understood that the termination provision in his contract of employment restricted his entitlement to notice and severance pay pursuant to the ESA. It is clear from the contents of Ariss' email in 2013, leading up to the letter signed on July 14, 2013, that he appreciated that the historical termination provision, based on the ESA, continued to apply. I find that Ariss fully understood, both when working full-time and when working part-time, that his entitlements on termination would be in accordance with the ESA.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Judgment, para 78, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 43.</P1></P>
<P>39. This finding is entitled to deference.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Housen</EM>], at para 25.</P1></P>
<P>40. It was clear to the parties, and on the face of the 2002 Contract, the 2006 Amendment, and the 2013 Amendment, that throughout Ariss' employment with NORR, his entitlements upon termination were limited to the ESA minimums.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>NORR's Actions on Ariss' Dismissal Are Not Relevant</EM></TI>
<P>41. The enforceability of a termination clause depends only on the wording of the clause itself. In <EM>Wood</EM>, the employer conceded that it paid the employee less than she was entitled under the ESA, but the Court of Appeal held that what the employer may have paid the employee voluntarily on termination had no bearing on whether the termination clause itself is enforceable. The only relevant factor was what the termination clause required the employer to pay the employee.
<P1><EM>Wood</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 23, at paras 43&ndash;48, 60.</P1></P>
<P>42. Similarly, whether NORR provided Ariss with more or less than the amount required by the ESA or the termination provision is not relevant to whether or not the termination provision is enforceable.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>THE ISSUE OF CONSIDERATION IS NOT RELEVANT</TI>
<P>43. The motion judge correctly held that the issue of consideration is not relevant to the determination of whether Ariss contracted out of common law reasonable notice. The termination provision sufficiently rebutted the presumption of common law reasonable notice, remained unchanged throughout Ariss' continuous employment with NORR, and Ariss clearly understood that it continued to apply following his transition to part-time hours.
<P1>Judgment, para 81, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 44.</P1></P>
<P>44. If this Court finds that the motion judge erred in failing to address consideration, which is denied, NORR submits that there was good consideration for the 2013 Amendment in NORR agreeing to transition Ariss to part-time hours and increase his hourly rate of pay.</P>
<P>45. It was Ariss who sought to make modifications to his contract of employment with NORR by transitioning to part-time hours. NORR's uncontradicted evidence is that it lost contracts for a number of government standing service agreements in late 2012 or early 2013. NORR was unsuccessful in resolving those losses, and sought to be cautious about allowing Ariss to transition to part-time hours. NORR was under no obligation to accommodate Ariss' request. The 2013 Amendment outlined the terms by which NORR agreed to allow that change.
<P1>Judgment, para 91-92, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 45.</P1></P>
<P>46. Though Ariss began working part-time hours on July 15, 2013, he was employed by NORR pursuant to the terms of the 2002 Contract and 2006 Amendment unless and until the parties agreed to modified terms. Ariss could either agree to the 2013 Amendment, remain employed with NORR in accordance with the terms of his full-time position, or resign completely and cease his employment with NORR. Ariss chose to agree to the 2013 Amendment.</P>
<P>47. Further, the parties had agreed to the terms of the 2013 Amendment by July 11, 2013. The terms did not change after Ariss began working part-time hours on July 15, 2013. Signing an employment agreement shortly after beginning work does not render that agreement void.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wallace v Toronto Dominion Bank</SOC><YEAR>1983</YEAR><CITE>41 OR (2d) 161</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>145 DLR (3d) 431</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at para 57.</P1></P>
<P>48. The case relied upon by Ariss, <CASEREF><SOC>Holland v. Hostopia Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 762</CITE></CASEREF>, (&ldquo;<EM>Holland</EM>&rdquo;) is distinguishable. In <EM>Holland</EM>, the employee accepted an offer of employment with an implied term that the employee was entitled to reasonable notice prior to the termination of his employment. Nine months after the employee began working, the employer asked the employee to sign a second agreement that contained a clause limiting the employee's entitlements to the ESA minimums. The Court of Appeal held that, without fresh consideration, the agreement did not displace the implied term of reasonable notice contained in the offer letter.
<P1><EM>Holland</EM>, at paras 1, 11, 49, 50, 55.</P1></P>
<P>49. In Ariss' case, there was no implied term of reasonable notice in his contract of employment with NORR in 2013, or at any other point in time. The parties agreed to rebut the presumption of reasonable notice at the beginning of Ariss' employment with NORR in 2002, and the terms of the 2013 Amendment were agreed before Ariss transitioned to part-time hours. The fact that Ariss began working part-time hours on July 15, 2013, before signing the 2013 Amendment, is not relevant in the circumstances.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>PUBLIC POLICY SUPPORTS NORR'S POSITION</TI>
<P>50. The policy issues outlined in <EM>Machtinger</EM> and referred to by Ariss are not relevant. This is not a case where an employer drafted a termination provision that fails to comply with the ESA and the only sanction faced is an order that the employer comply with the ESA. NORR drafted a termination provision that complied with the minimum notice period prescribed in the ESA. In the motion judge's words, Ariss &ldquo;is not an unsophisticated business person&rdquo;. Ariss agreed to the termination provision, and understood that it applied throughout his employment with NORR. The resulting outcome is an order that NORR provide Ariss with the termination entitlements as agreed between Ariss and NORR and documented in his employment agreement.
<P1><EM>Machtinger</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 3, at para 33.</P1>
<P1>Judgment, para 77, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 43.</P1></P>
<P>51. The motion judge properly held that the presumption of common law notice had been rebutted and Ariss is only entitled to notice of termination in accordance with the ESA. There is no reason to interfere with the motion judge's decision.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>APPEAL ISSUE TWO: Rule 49 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> should govern costs at first instance.</TI>
<P>52. NORR agrees that Rule 49 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, should govern costs at first instance, dependant on the outcome of the appeal and cross-appeal.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ISSUES RAISED IN CROSS-APPEAL</TI>
<P>53. The cross-appeal raises the following issue: if this Court finds that Ariss is entitled to common law notice of the termination of his employment, did the motion judge err by failing to address the issue of mitigation?</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>CROSS-APPEAL ISSUE: If Ariss is entitled to common law notice of the termination of his employment, the motion judge erred in failing to address the issue of mitigation.</TI>
<P>54. If this Court finds that the motion judge erred in holding that Ariss is only entitled to notice of termination in accordance with the ESA, NORR submits that the motion judge erred in law by making a determination on Ariss' reasonable notice period, but failing to address the issue of mitigation.</P>
<P>55. With respect to the issue of Ariss' failure to mitigate, the motion judge stated:
<QUOTE><P>NORR's position is that if Ariss is found to be entitled to common law notice then (a) a finding should be made that Ariss breached his obligation to mitigate his damages, and (b) the damages to which Ariss is entitled must be reduced accordingly. NORR submits that the issue of mitigation is not appropriate for determination by way of a motion for summary judgment. NORR argues that Ariss has not met the onus he must meet to demonstrate that the mitigation issue does not require a trial.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Judgment, para 115, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 49.</P1></P>
<P>56. The motion judge then held that, in light of the finding that Ariss had contracted out of common law notice provisions, it was not necessary to determine the issue of Ariss' alleged failure to mitigate. The motion judge's failure to consider the issue of mitigation is an error of law and the standard of review is correctness.
<P1>Judgment, para 116, at ABCO, Tab 7, p 49.</P1>
<P1><EM>Housen</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 39, at para 8.</P1></P>
<P>57. A wrongfully dismissed employee has a duty to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his or her damages and reduce the amount payable by the employer. Where the plaintiff's efforts to mitigate damages are contested, reasonable notice is a triable issue that is not appropriate for summary judgment.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Michaels v Red Deer College</SOC><YEAR>1975</YEAR><CITE>[1976] 2 SCR 324</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>

<P>58. Ariss made insufficient efforts to mitigate his damages. Ariss claims to have &ldquo;proactively approached some architectural firms&rdquo; in Kingston, but waited until November 2016&mdash;more than eight months after his employment with NORR was terminated&mdash;to contact them.
<P1>Ariss Affidavit, para 57, at Compendium, Tab 1, p 9.</P1>
<P1>Ariss Affidavit, Exhibit Q, at Compendium, Tab 1-Q, pp 33-34.</P1></P>
<P>59. Ariss made minimal efforts to find a new architectural position in Kingston (the city where he resides). Ariss has not sought the assistance of a recruitment agency or updated his skills by learning basic architecture software, which he knows would make him more marketable.</P>
<P>60. A dismissed employee will have failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate where they do not look for jobs outside of a single town that has few employment opportunities in the employee's profession. Ariss has almost exclusively searched for jobs in Kingston, which is a very small architecture market. Ariss has acknowledged that, by December 2016, he knew it was unlikely that he would get a job in Kingston as an architect, yet he did not expand his search for architectural positions. Ariss did not search for non-architectural positions anywhere.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Birnbaum v Lamda Mercantile Corp</SOC><CITE>1977 CarswellOnt 2883</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1977] 1 ACWS 394</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at para 16 (ON HCJ)</P1></P>
<P>61. NORR has shown that suitable job opportunities have been available to Ariss in Ottawa since his dismissal. Ariss has admitted to seeing job opportunities that he is likely qualified for, but the opportunities are located outside of Kingston and Ariss has not applied for any opportunities outside of Kingston.</P>
<P>62. Accordingly, if Ariss is entitled to common law notice, the motion judge erred in failing to address mitigation, including whether or not the issue was appropriate for summary judgment, or whether a trial is required.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P>63. NORR respectfully requests an order:
<P1>(a) that the appeal be dismissed; and</P1>
<P1>(b) for the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal on a substantial indemnity basis.</P1></P>
<P>64. In the alternative, if the appeal is granted, NORR respectfully requests an order:
<P1>(a) that the cross-appeal be granted;</P1>
<P1>(b) declaring that Ariss breached his obligation to mitigate his damages and, if Ariss is entitled to damages in excess of his ESA entitlement, the damages must be reduced accordingly;</P1>
<P1>(c) fixing the reasonable notice period to reflect Ariss' failure to mitigate his damages; and</P1>
<P1>(d) for the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal on a substantial indemnity basis.</P1></P>
<P>65. In the further alternative, if the appeal is granted, NORR respectfully requests an order:
<P1>(a) that the cross-appeal be granted;</P1>
<P1>(b) directing that the issue of mitigation proceed to trial expeditiously, pursuant to Rule 20.05 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194; or</P1>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE RESPONDENT BY CROSS-APPEAL (JOHN DAVID ARISS)</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. Justice Corthorn determined that the Appellant and Respondent by Cross-Appeal, John David Ariss (&ldquo;Ariss&rdquo;), did not have an entitlement to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment, but stated in her decision that, if he did, the reasonable notice period would be 22 months.</P>
<P>2. Since the motion judge did not find a reasonable notice entitlement, she explained that it was not necessary to make a determination of whether or not the Respondent and Appellant by Cross-Appeal, NORR Limited Architects and Engineers (&ldquo;NORR&rdquo;), had demonstrated a failure by Ariss to mitigate his damages and, if so, if any reduction should be made to his common law entitlement.</P>
<P>3. It is not in dispute that the 34 weeks of termination and severance pay that Ariss has already been awarded pursuant to the <EM>Employment Standards Act</EM> is not subject to the duty to mitigate, but any reasonable notice income in excess of that amount is.</P>
<P>4. Fulsome submissions on the issue of mitigation were made to the motion judge by both parties.</P>
<P>5. Ariss has never disputed NORR's assertion that the issue of mitigation must be determined in the event that he is successful in his appeal and is entitled to reasonable notice of the termination of his employment, but states that he has met his mitigation obligations and that he has an entitlement to a full 22 months of lost income, less amounts already awarded.</P>
<P>6. While the motion judge is in a position to decide this matter, given that full submissions are required to respond to this Cross-Appeal, Ariss consents to the Court of Appeal determining the issue, notwithstanding his position that the Cross-Appeal added unnecessary cost to the process.</P>
<P>7. As the 22 month notice period has now passed, Ariss proposes to credit NORR for any mitigation earnings in that reasonable notice period beyond his statutory entitlements.</P>
<P>8. NORR did not raise the issue of the suitability of summary judgment to the determination of mitigation in its Notice of Cross-Appeal, nor did it request a trial of the issue or propose returning this narrow issue to the motion judge for determination. It only raised the question of whether it had proven a failure to mitigate damages and requested the Court of Appeal address the matter.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><TI>Judgment</TI>
<P>9. Justice Corthorn explained, &ldquo;The request for a finding of 22 months' notice is at the low end of the range. I find the request to be reasonable. If Ariss were entitled to common law notice (and I find he is not so entitled), the notice period would be 22 months.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ariss v. NORR Limited Architects &amp; Engineers</SOC><CITE>2018 ONSC 620</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Judgment], para 104 at Appeal Book and Compendium [ABCO] Tab 7, p. 47.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. Respecting mitigation, Justice Corthorn summarized NORR's position in the motion as follows: &ldquo;NORR's position is that if Ariss is found to be entitled to common law notice then (a) a finding should be made that Ariss breached his obligation to mitigate his damages, and (b) the damages to which Ariss is entitled must be reduced accordingly.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 115 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 49.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. Given that Justice Corthorn did not find that Ariss is entitled to common law notice, she found that it was not necessary to determine the question of mitigation. Effectively, she understood that mitigation would be relevant only if there was a common law reasonable notice entitlement. All parties agree this is the case.
<P1><BOLD>Judgment para 116 at ABCO Tab 7, p. 49.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Education and Employment History</TI>
<P>12. Ariss obtained a degree in geography and urban studies from York University in 1976 and a degree in architecture from the University of British Columbia in 1984.

<P>13. After performing a series of short contracts in Toronto, in February 1986, Ariss commenced work with NORR and its predecessors as an architect. He remained there for nearly 30 years until he was dismissed at age 62.

<BLOCK3><TI>Intention to Work</TI>
<P>14. Ariss did not have short-term retirement plans at the time that he was dismissed in January 2016. He expected to work at least as much, if not more, in 2016 and 2017 as he did in 2015.

<BLOCK3><TI>Kingston Job Market</TI>
<P>15. Ariss was left to look for alternative work in Kingston, Ontario, where NORR was one of the largest architectural firms in town.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit para 53 at RXCO Tab 1, p. 9 and EB Tab 1, p. 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>16. Even NORR has admitted that there are few architecture firms in Kington, that existing firms are struggling, and that the market for Mr. Ariss' speciality, being government and correctional buildings, was drying up in the area. NORR has since closed its office there.

<BLOCK3><TI>Job Search Efforts</TI>
<P>17. Ariss disputes that he made minimal efforts to find a new architectural position in Kingston. Ariss prepared a resume and sought reference letters from his NORR colleagues, George Bitsakakis, Vice President, Operations, and David Jefferies, Principal, NORR Kingston.

<P1><BOLD>Ariss Affidavit, para 62, at RXCO Tab 1, p. 10 and EB Tab 1, p. 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. During his work with NORR and its predecessors, Ariss worked with a number of local architects who later moved on to other firms. He also participated in a mentorship program through the Ontario Association of Architects. He has networked with these individuals since his dismissal, along with some former clients and university classmates, who know both him and his work.

<BLOCK3><TI>Beyond Architecture</TI>
<P>30. Ariss learned various skills as an architect including design, project management, and project review. Contrary to NORR's allegation that Ariss did not broaden his search beyond architectural positions, he explored project management opportunities as well:

<BLOCK3><TI>Outcome of Search</TI>
<P>36. Prior to his dismissal from NORR, Ariss was approached by local architect, Al Cromarty, with an offer to take over his business, which he declined.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit para 41 at RXCO Tab 4, p. 74 and EB Tab 4, p. 166.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. In May 2016, Mr. Cromarty called Ariss and suggested that he use his name as a lead architect in a proposal. Ariss learned that it was for full-time work, including very long hours, for up to ten years. This was not an offer of employment.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit, para 44, 45 at RXCO Tab 4, p. 74 and EB Tab 4, p. 166.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>38. Mr. Cromarty was 89 years old at the time. Ariss was concerned about his long term ability to deliver on this project, should the bid be successful, and his own potential obligations should Mr. Cromarty's health decline and he need to retire.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit, para 46 at RXCO Tab 4, p. 74 and EB Tab 4, p. 166.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>39. He truthfully advised Mr. Cromarty that he was looking for part-time employment, comparable to what he had an NORR. Mr. Cromarty did not have anything comparable to offer.

<BLOCK3><TI>Self-Employment</TI>
<P>40. Ariss also was not in a position to take on the financial risk, administrative and accounting roles, and time commitment involved in running a business at this point in his career. He knew the market was not strong.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit, para 47 at RXCO Tab 4, p. 75 and EB Tab 4, p. 167.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. To work on his own would require a Certificate of Practice which would involve more money, more applications and insurance provisions. Nonetheless, he explored these licensing options.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Cross p. 61, Q. 386, 387 at RXCO Tab 5, p. 90 and EB Tab 7, p. 241.</BOLD></P1></P>

<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N><UNDER>1</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Is the determination of mitigation suitable for summary judgment?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>Suitable for Summary Judgment</TI>
<P>60. NORR did not raise the issue of the suitability of summary judgment to the determination of mitigation in its Notice of Cross-Appeal, nor did it seek an order that a trial be required or that the motion judge determine the issue. As such, it should be prohibited from raising the issue or seeking associated relief.

<P>61. Regardless, the determination of common law reasonable notice, as impacted by mitigation, is appropriate in a summary judgment forum. The court in <CASEREF><SOC>Maasland v. City of Toronto</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 7598 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Maasland</EM>],</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Markoulakis v.

Delta Printing Limited</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 182</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Vinette</EM>],</BOLD> amongst others all found this to be an appropriate forum for the determination of reasonable notice. Each considered mitigation.</P>
<P>62. Justice MacLeod in <BOLD><EM>Vinette</EM></BOLD> wrote:
<QUOTE><P>There have now been a series of cases in this court holding that summary judgment is a process that may be particularly suited for determination of notice periods in cases of termination without cause. The law was reviewed by Justice Hackland in <CASEREF><SOC>Beatty v.

<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Vinette v. Delta Printing Limited</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 182</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>63. The cases cited by NORR suggesting that the determination of mitigation requires a trial all pre-date the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>[2014] 1 SCR 87 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, which changed the legal landscape surrounding the suitability of summary judgment. NORR had the opportunity to cross-examine on the Ariss affidavits. There is no reason that the law cannot be applied to the facts. A trial would add a disproportionate amount of additional costs and further delay the determination of this matter.

<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N><UNDER>2</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>What is the standard of review?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>64. The Court of Appeal is being asked to perform the role of the motion judge, who heard and has before her all evidence and argument on the issue of mitigation. The motion judge did not err on the issue of mitigation, but simply did not make the determination on the basis that it was a moot point in the context of her other findings. It is Ariss' position that Justice Corthorn erred on the issue of his entitlement to common law reasonable notice of the termination of his employment, and, as such, the issue of mitigation must now be determined.</P>
<P>65. Given that Ariss was required to respond to the Cross-Appeal, it is most efficient for the Court of Appeal now to determine the issue, however there is no decision to review. Rather, the Court of Appeal is effectively hearing this matter at first instance and standard of review is not applicable. The same effect would be had by sending the issue back to the motion judge for determination; however that may now cause further delay.</P>
<P>66. It is not the reasonable notice determination that would change in the context of a mitigation assessment. Justice Corthorn is correct on the 22 month number, which was not contested in first instance and cannot be contested now. Rather, consideration of mitigation determines if the 22 month damages award should be reduced by a failure to meet those obligations. Ariss states that NORR has failed to demonstrate that a reduction is appropriate.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N><UNDER>3</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Has NORR demonstrated a failure by Ariss to mitigate his damages?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>Onus of Proof</TI>
<P>67. An employer has the burden of proving a failure to mitigate damages.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Markoulakis</EM> at para 7.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>No Work in Kingston</TI>
<P>68. No suitable work opportunities for Ariss arose in Kingston or the surrounding area during the reasonable notice period, though Ariss demonstrated significant efforts to reach out to local businesses and contacts to explore opportunities. Preparing his resume, seeking out reference letters, researching jobs online and in the newspaper, proactively contacting architectural firms and other businesses in the area, networking, and expanding his search to full-time roles and project management roles collectively demonstrated reasonable efforts on his part to mitigate his damages.</P>
<P>69. NORR accepts that architect job opportunities in Kingston were difficult to come by and that existing firms were struggling to maintain their businesses. NORR did not last in the market and closed its doors.
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit para 28, 37 at RXCO Tab 2, p. 39, 41 and EB Tab 2, p. 69, 71</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Gerstmar Affidavit, para 15 at RXCO Tab 3, p. 67 and EB Tab 3, p. 143.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>70. NORR has not suggested or demonstrated that there were any suitable roles in Kingston or the surrounding area for Ariss to apply to and effectively acknowledged that there were none. As such, they have not met the onus of demonstrating a failure to mitigate in Kingston and area.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>Commute Limitations</TI>
<P>71. Rather, by submitting job postings in the area, NORR has suggested that Ariss should either commute or relocate to Ottawa.
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit para 38 at RXCO Tab 2, p. 42 and EB Tab 2, p. 72.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>Souter Affidavit Exhibit L at RXCO Tab 2L, p. 44 and EB Tab 2L, p. 119.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>72. Even if Ariss met the qualifications for the roles in Ottawa proposed by NORR, which he does not, it would not be reasonable for him to apply for them given the distance between Kingston and Ottawa.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit, para 30&ndash;36 at RXCO Tab 4, p.73 and EB Tab 4, p. 165.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. In <BOLD><EM>Maasland</EM></BOLD> the court rejected an employer's argument that an individual should have applied for a job 50 km away. The Court reasoned, &ldquo;It was reasonable for her not to pursue a job that would, if she had got it, have involved a significant daily commute.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>Maasland</EM> at para 43.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>74. Ariss states that he was likewise not obligated to apply for jobs in Ottawa, some 200 km away; Toronto, approximately 250 km away; or Sudbury, approximately 600 km away.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>Relocation Unreasonable</TI>
<P>75. The Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Peet v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 CanLII 24077</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> found that, given an employee's age of 53 and his ties to his community, he could not be expected to move to accept another position with his current employer.</P>
<P>76. Ultimately, the court noted, &ldquo;The respondent's efforts at mitigation cannot be classified as unreasonable simply because his actions did not neglect all other interests while focusing exclusively on his short-term obligation to mitigate damages for the sake of his former employer.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Peet v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2001 CanLII 24077</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>77. The Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Kees Van Schalkwyk v. Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>1995 CanLII 7294</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Kees</EM>]</BOLD> surveyed case law surrounding relocation and mitigation, asking whether an employee is required to take a position that will involve a major relocation. Ultimately, the employee in Kees was not required to take either of two long distance job offers.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kees Van Schalkwyk v. Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>1995 CanLII 7294</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Kees</EM>] para 66.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>78. It cited <CASEREF><SOC>Curry v. Lakeland Library Region</SOC><YEAR>1980</YEAR><CITE>3 Sask. R. 364</CITE><COURTJUR>Q.B</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, where an employee worked in the same community, for the same employer, for 30 years, and had established a family home. Relocation and search elsewhere at the age of 55 was not required.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Kees</EM> para 52.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>79. The Court in <BOLD><EM>Kees</EM></BOLD> noted, &ldquo;certainly family reasons are considered by the court in deciding whether the plaintiff was acting reasonably in refusing to move&rdquo;. They cited David Harris' text, <UNDER>Wrongful Dismissal</UNDER>, 1990 ed. (Toronto: Carswell 1989), at 4-253, which lists the obligation to care for an elderly dependent as one such family reason.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Kees</EM> para 60, 61.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>80. Ariss was 62 at the time of his dismissal. He states that moving would impact his wife's job; his long term ties to Kingston, where they own a home; their ability to care for his wife's elderly father; and their proximity to their daughter. Relocating would be highly disruptive and costly.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N><UNDER>4</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>What reduction in damages is appropriate, if any?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>No Reduction Justified</TI>
<P>81. Ariss states that he has acted reasonably to mitigate his damages. Accordingly, no reduction to the 22 month notice period is justified, particularly where the notice period awarded was determined to be &ldquo;at the low end of the range&rdquo; and he has made considerable efforts to secure alternative employment in a challenging market.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ARGUMENT RE: ISSUES RAISED BY ARISS</TI>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N><UNDER>1</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>How should the Court address the issue of mitigation for the portion of the notice period that occurred after Ariss' Reply Affidavit?</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI>Balance Of Notice Period</TI>
<P>82. Although there is no evidence of Ariss' mitigation efforts between April 2017 and November 2017 because his Reply affidavit was due at the end of March 2017, it is appropriate for the Court of Appeal to order loss of income in lump sum for the full notice period, less amounts already paid, and less amounts earned in mitigation between April 2017 and November 2017.</P>
<P>83. The Court of Appeal has demonstrated a willingness and ability to uphold notice awards absent further evidence on mitigation efforts where a summary judgment motion was heard prior to the expiration of the reasonable notice period.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Markoulakis</EM> para 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>84. In <CASEREF><SOC>Bernier v. Nygard International Partnership</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 780 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal affirmed that it was appropriate for the motion judge to order a lump sum in lieu of notice and require that any earnings of the employee during the notice period be placed in a trust for the employer.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bernier v. Nygard International Partnership</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 78 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>6</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>85. The same approach was taken at first instance in <CASEREF><SOC>Paquette v. TeraGo Networks Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 618 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, as summarized in the appeal decision: &ldquo;He found that the appellant had made reasonable efforts to mitigate his damages and directed him to account for any mitigation earnings for the balance of the reasonable notice period, with such earnings subject to a trust in favour of the respondent.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Paquette v. TeraGo Networks Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 618 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>3</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>86. In the instant matter, the notice period had not lapsed to the date of Ariss Reply Affidavit or to the date of the summary judgment motion. As of the Reply Affidavit, Ariss had not earned any mitigation income.
<P1><BOLD>Ariss Reply Affidavit para 50 at RXCO Tab 4, p. 75 and EB Tab 4, p. 167.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>87. There was no opportunity for new or further evidence to be brought to the Court of Appeal respecting Ariss' mitigation efforts between April 2017 and November 2017.</P>
<P>88. It has now been more than 22 months since Ariss' dismissal in January 2016.</P>
<P>89. Given that the notice period has now expired, it is appropriate for NORR to pay Ariss a lump sum equivalent to 22 months of income, less amounts already paid, less any mitigation amounts that Ariss has earned since his Reply Affidavit.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>90. Ariss requests an Order that he is entitled to 22 months of income, less amounts already paid, less any mitigation income earned between April 2017 and November 2017.</P>
<P>91. He seeks costs of the Cross-Appeal on a substantial indemnity basis, as this matter could have been sent back to the motion judge for determination.</P>
