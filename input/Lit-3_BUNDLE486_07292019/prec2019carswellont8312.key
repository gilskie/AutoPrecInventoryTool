<P>1. The Plaintiff claims as against the Defendants, Yao Jun Situ and Yao Feng Situ:

<P>2. The Plaintiffs claim is on a Mortgage (&ldquo;Main Mortgage&rdquo;) made between Yao Feng Situ and Yao Jun Situ, as mortgagors and Benson Custodian Corporation as mortgagee, and registered as Instrument No. [#omitted]on May 1, 2017, in the Land Registry Office for the Land Titles Division of Toronto (No. [#omitted]) under which Mortgage the mortgagors mortgaged the lands hereinafter described for a period of six (6) months commencing May 1, 2017 securing the principal sum of $725,000.00 and interest thereon at the rate of 13.99% per annum calculated monthly, not in advance as well after as before maturity and both before and after default.

<P>4. The mortgage was further secured against another property owned by the Defendant, Yao Jun Sit wherein all payments made under one mortgage would be considered to be a payment under the collateral mortgage and default under one mortgage would be considered a default on the other mortgage. The mortgage provided that upon default the mortgagee could at their sole discretion exercise their rights against any or all properties in order to recover all sums due on the mortgage.</P>
<P>[location omitted]</P>
<P>5. The Plaintiff's further claim is on a collateral mortgage made between Yao Jun Situ as mortgagor and Benson Custodian Corporation as mortgagee and registered as Instrument No.[#omitted]on May 1, 2017, in the Land Registry Office for the Land Titles Division of Toronto (No.[#omitted] under the same terms and provisions as the Lewiston Property.

<P>6.

<P>7. The taking of a Judgment or Judgments on any of the covenants herein contained shall not operate as a merger of the said covenants or affect the mortgagee's right to interest at the rate and times herein provided.</P>
<P>8. Each mortgage provides that upon default of payment of monies hereby secured or payable, the principal and interest owing shall immediately become due and payable at the option of the mortgagee.</P>
<P>9. Each mortgage provides that on default the mortgagee shall have quiet possession of the said lands free from all encumbrances.</P>
<P>10. The mortgage was renewed from time to time and the most recent renewal particulars are as follows:

<P>1. The Defendants deny the allegations set out in the Statement of Claim except as hereinafter admitted.</P>
<P>2. The Defendants admit that the mortgage in question came due on November 1, 2017 but state that they have always made all payments required under the mortgage and that the mortgage should be deemed to have been renewed on the same terms for a further period in accordance with the discussions between the Defendants and the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>3. The Defendants deny that the Plaintiff is entitled to late discharge fees or administration fees but state instead that the Defendants have always been willing to continue to make the monthly interest payments required under the mortgage and have continued to do so, and so no such fees should be payable.</P>
<P>4. The Defendants deny that the Plaintiff is entitled to possession of the properties as the Defendants are not in default of the mortgage and as the mortgage should be deemed to have been renewed.</P>
<P>5. The Defendants deny that any amount is outstanding for accrued interest and further deny that the Plaintiff is entitled to any legal costs given the fact that there has been no default.</P>
<P>6. The Defendants state that this claim should be dismissed as against them with costs.</P>

<P>I, Egor Ivandaev, of the City of Richmond Hill in the Province of Ontario, <BOLD>MAKE OATH AND SAY:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. I am a Senior Fund Manager employed by the Plaintiff and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to.</P>
<P>2. On May 1, 2017 the defendants granted the plaintiff a mortgage (&ldquo;main mortgage&rdquo;) over a property municipally known as [location omitted] (Lewison Property&rdquo;). This was a mortgage for a period of six (6 months) commencing May 1, 2017 securing the principal sum of $725,000.00 and interest thereon at the rate of 13.99% per annum calculated monthly. The mortgage provides for payment by monthly instalments of $8,452.30 to be paid on the first day of each month including June 1, 2017 and the balance, if any, of the said principle sum and interest shall become due payable on November 1, 2017. <BOLD>Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a true copy of the mortgage/charge dated May 1, 2017</BOLD>.</P>
<P>3. The mortgage was secured against another property owned by the Defendant, Yao Jun Sit wherein all payments made under one mortgage would be considered to be payment under the collateral mortgage and default under one mortgage would be considered a default on the other mortgage. The mortgage provided that upon default the mortgagee could at their sole discretion exercise their rights against any or all properties in order to recover all sums due on the mortgage. The collateral property is municipally known as [location omitted] (&ldquo;Lathan Property&rdquo;). <BOLD>Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a true copy of the mortgage / charge dated May 1, 2017</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. Each mortgage provides that upon default of payment of monies hereby secured or payable, the balance of the principal and interest shall immediately become due and payable at the option of the mortgagee. Each mortgage provides that upon default that the mortgagee shall have quiet possession of the said lands free from all encumbrances. <BOLD>Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a true copy of the mortgage / charge dated May 1, 2017</BOLD>.</P>
<P>5. The mortgage was renewed from time to time and the most recent renewal particulars are as follows:

<P>6. When the mortgage was set to mature on May 1, 2018 the plaintiff demanded a full payout or steps would be taken to enforce same as set-out in a letter dated April 25, 2018. <BOLD>Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; is a true copy of a letter from counsel for the plaintiff dated April 25, 2018 addressed to the defendants.</BOLD></P>
<P>7. Shortly after receiving the April 25, 2018 letter the defendants requested that the plaintiff grant another short term renewal in order that they be able to secure alternative financing in order to payout the plaintiff's mortgage in full. The plaintiff agreed to same provided that the defendants paid down the principle balance which they did. There is no obligation for the plaintiff to grant renewals. Once a mortgage has matured it is up to the lender to decide whether or not to grant a renewal.</P>
<P>8. The mortgage matured on November 1, 2018 at which time the full balance became due and payable in full. From my review of the file, the plaintiff contacted a representative for the defendants by email on July 11, 2018, July 26, 2018 and October 30, 2018 to inquire about the status of the defendant obtaining refinancing and that a discharge request has not been received yet. On September 17, 2018 counsel for plaintiff wrote to the defendants advising them that the plaintiff is not willing to renew the mortgage on maturity. The defendant was advised that they must payout the mortgage in full on or before November 1, 2018. <BOLD>Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; is a true copy of the letter dated September 17, 2018</BOLD>.</P>
<P>9. As of November 1, 2018 the mortgage balance had not been paid and is currently in default and such default has not been cured to date. At the request of counsel for the defendants, the plaintiff provided a statement effective February 28, 2019 advising as to how much is owed as of that day. As per the February 28, 2019 statement the amount owed is as follows:

<P>10. The defendants are liable to pay these sums and subsequent interest at the rate of 14.5% per annum.</P>
<P>11. On November 29, 2018 a Notice of Sale Under Mortgage was commenced and all interested parties were notified that unless the sums were paid on or before January 9, 2019 that the plaintiffs advised that they would sell the property. Since that time, nothing has been paid towards the property. The defendants continue to reside in the property and it has not been listed to be sold yet.</P>
<P>12. I have reviewed the statement of defence and I do not believe that any viable defence has been raised by the defendants. The defendants are in default and the mortgage has become due and payable in full.</P>
<P>13. Section 16 of the mortgage addresses &ldquo;default of payment and issuing of notice of sale and statement of claim&rdquo;. Two of the consequences of the default of payment within that section include: (a) the calculation of administrative charges (which in this case amount to $3,000) and (b) liquidated damages from the mortgagor(s) a sum equal to the payment of three (3) months interest on the principal amount outstanding.</P>
<P>14. Based on the premise that the defendants continue to not make any payments on the mortgage the total amount owing with respect to interest as of November 1, 2018 equals $600,000 plus a per diem of $238.36 everyday thereafter. As of the motion scheduled for May 13, 2019 the amount due and owing for interest totals $46,003.48 (193 days).</P>
<P>15. I make this affidavit in support of a motion for summary judgment and for no other purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF YAO JUN SITU</TI>
<P>I, Yao Jun Situ, of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a Defendant herein and, as such, have knowledge of the matters herein after deposed to.</P>
<P>2. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a copy of the Statement of Defence that has been filed to this action. The facts set out in the Statement of Defence are true.</P>
<P>3. [location omitted] is a property owned by my brother and I. The property was purchased by my brother and I in 1993 to provide a place for our parents to reside. My mother, who is currently 85 years of age, continues to reside in this property. I purchased[location omitted]in 2009 and reside in that property with my family.</P>
<P>4. In May 2017, my brother and I took out a mortgage from the Plaintiff to be secured as against [location omitted]and[location omitted] for the purpose of paying property taxes that had come due with respect to a commercial property in which I have an interest at [location omitted] [location omitted]</P>
<P>5. The Mortgage of the Plaintiff was renewed and subsequently came due on November 1, 2018. All mortgage payments were made by myself during the currency of the mortgage.</P>
<P>6. I offered to renew the mortgage of the Plaintiff prior to its expiry, however, the Plaintiff refused. Commencing on or about November 1, 2018 the Plaintiff refused to accept any further mortgage payments and indicated that they sought a discharge of their mortgage.</P>
<P>7. Since that time I have actively been attempting to obtain replacement financing so that I may discharge the Plaintiff's mortgage. I have obtained replacement financing from the Equitable Trust Company in an amount which should be sufficient to discharge the Plaintiff's indebtedness.</P>
<P>8. Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a copy of an email from Axess Law, the solicitors for myself and the Equitable Trust indicating the amounts that are available to discharge the mortgages as against 20 Latham Avenue and the collateral property which is [location omitted] [location omitted]</P>
<P>9. Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a copy of a discharge Statement that has been received from the Plaintiff. I dispute the entitlement of the Plaintiff to the amounts claimed for a three (3) month interest penalty and also for their administrative fees.</P>
<P>10. I was at all times willing to pay the monthly interest amounts and accordingly I contend that the Plaintiff is not entitled to a three (3) month interest penalty nor to their administrative fees nor to their legal fees herein.</P>
<P>11. I am willing to pay the principal amount outstanding, together with the interest to the date of payment in return for a discharge of the mortgage. The balance of the matter may be tried in the normal course. Alternatively, I am willing to proceed to Trial on all issues.</P>
<P>12. No Order for Possession should issue as I have been always willing to pay the Plaintiff's mortgage and neither my mother nor myself should not be inconvenienced by being forced to relocate given my willingness to pay the amounts properly outstanding.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE PLAINTIFF</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE MOTION</TI>
<P>1. This is a motion for summary judgment as against the defendants for defaulting on their mortgage. The defendants defaulted on payment of the mortgage on November 1, 2018 and have not made any payments since that time.</P>
<P>2. There is no genuine issue requiring a trial arising from the statement of defence, or indeed, at all.</P>
<P>3. The defendants are in non-compliance with a consent court order timetable as they have failed to serve a responding affidavit.</P>
<P>4. Granting the plaintiff the summary judgment it seeks will secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of this proceeding on its merits.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Mortgage Default</TI>
<P>2. On May 1, 2017 the defendants granted the plaintiff a mortgage (&ldquo;main mortgage&rdquo;) over a property municipally known as [location omitted] (Lewison Property&rdquo;). This was a mortgage for a period of six (6 months) commencing May 1, 2017 securing the principal sum of $725,000.00 and interest thereon at the rate of 13.99% per annum calculated monthly. The mortgage provides for payment by monthly instalments of $8,452.30 to be paid on the first day of each month including June 1, 2017 and the balance, if any, of the said principle sum and interest shall become due payable on November 1, 2017. <BOLD>Plaintiff's Motion Record Ivandaev Affidavit (Ivandaev Affidavit) paragraph 2</BOLD>.</P>
<P>3. The mortgage was secured against another property owned by the Defendant, Yao Jun Sit wherein all payments made under one mortgage would be considered to be payment under the collateral mortgage and default under one mortgage would be considered a default on the other mortgage. The mortgage provided that upon default the mortgagee could at their sole discretion exercise their rights against any or all properties in order to recover all sums due on the mortgage. The col lateral Property is municipally known as [location omitted](&ldquo;Latham Property&rdquo;). <BOLD>Ivandaev Affidavit paragraph 3</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. Each mortgage provides that upon default of payment of monies hereby secured or payable, the balance of the principal and interest shall immediately become due and payable at the option of the mortgagee. Each mortgage provides that upon default that the mortgagee shall have quiet possession of the said lands free from all encumbrances. <BOLD>Ivandaev Affidavit paragraph 4</BOLD>.</P>
<P>5. The mortgage was renewed from time to time and the most recent renewal particulars are as follows:

<P>6. The plaintiff contacted a representative for the defendants by email on July 11, 2018, July 26, 2018 and October 30, 2018 to inquire about the status of the defendant obtaining refinancing and that a discharge request has not been received yet. On September 17, 2018 counsel for plaintiff wrote to the defendants advising them that the plaintiff is not willing to renew the mor tgage on maturity. As of November 1, 2018 the mortgage balance had not been paid and is currently in default and such default has not been cured to date. At the request of counsel for the defendants, the plaintiff provided a statement effective February 28, 2019 advising as to how much is owed as of that day. As per the February 28, 2019 statement the amount owed is as follows:

<P>7. On November 29, 2018 a Notice of Sale Under Mortgage was commenced and all interested parties were notified that unless the sums were paid on or before January 9, 2019 that the Plaintiffs advised that they would sell the property. Since that time, nothing has been paid towards the property. The defendants continue to reside in the property and it has not been listed, to be sold yet. <BOLD>Ivandaev Affidavit paragraph 11</BOLD>.</P>
<P>8. The statement of defence does not provide any viable defence to the issue of the non-payment of the mortgage. The defendants are in default and the mortgage has become due and payable in full. <BOLD>Ivandaev Affidavit paragraph 12</BOLD>.</P>
<P>9. On March 26, 2019 a timetable was set on consent in this matter. The defendant has failed to comply with the timetable as they have not provided a responding motion record.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES, LAW AND ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Issues</TI>
<P>10. This motion raises the following issues:
<P1>(a) Is this matter amenable to summary judgment?</P1>
<P1>(b) If so, what is the amount owing under the unredeemed mortgage?</P1>
<P1>(c) Is the plaintiff entitled to possession of the lands as set-out in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;?</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Law</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Test on a Motion for Summary Judgment</EM></TI>
<P>11. A plaintiff may, after the defendant has delivered a statement of defence, move with supporting affidavit material or other evidence for summary judgment. The Court <EM>shall</EM> grant judgment if it is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to the claim.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, Rules 20.01(1) &amp; 20.04(1)(a).</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. In light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, the motion judge without using the new fact-finding powers, determine whether there is a genuine issue requiring a trial based only on the evidence before the Court. There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when the summary judgment process: &ldquo;(1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (1) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><PARANUM>49 and 66</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Plaintiff's Book of Authorities, Tab 1</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>13. In response to affidavit material or other evidence supporting a motion for summary judgment, the defendant may not rest solely on the allegations in the statement of defence but, rather, must set out, in affidavit material or other evidence, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial. The court will assume that the parties have placed before it, in some form, all of the evidence that will be available for trial.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, Rule 20.02(2)</BOLD>.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sweda Farms Ltd v. Egg Farmers of Ontario</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 1200</CITE><PARANUM>33-34</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2014 ONCA 878</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF><BOLD>, Plaintiff's Book of Authorities, Tabs 2&amp;3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. The standard for fairness to be applied when determining whether the summary judgment process is appropriate in the circumstances is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as trial, but whether it gives the judge confidence that they can find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve the dispute.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE><PARANUM>50</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Plaintiff's Book of Authorities, Tab 1</BOLD>.</P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>There is no Genuine Issue Requiring a Trial</TI>
<P>15. This matter is suitable for summary judgement. The Court can confidently find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles on the record before it.</P>
<P>16. The statement of defence does not provide a viable defence to statement of clam. The defendants have not provided a responding motion record to assert the substance of their defence as per the court mandated timetable.</P>
<P>17. The defendants may not rest solely on the allegations in the statement of defence but, rather, must set out, in affidavit material or other evidence, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial. The defendants have failed to do so.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>18. The plaintiff therefore respectfully requests an order as follows:
<P1>(a) summary judgment against the defendants for $631,326.13 plus a per diem of $238.36 multiplied by 196 days between November 1, 2018 to May 13, 2019 (motion date) which equals $46,718.56 in accordance with the Statement of Claim for payment under a mortgage made between the plaintiff and the defendants for a total of $678,044.69;</P1>
<P1>(b) possession of the lands as set-out in motion materials;</P1>
<P1>(c) post-judgment interest at the rate of 14.5% per annum from May 1, 2019 to the date of payment or Judgment;</P1>
<P1>(d) the costs of this action and motion on a substantial indemnity basis.</P1></P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMTTED.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. In this mortgage matter, the Plaintiff refused to renew a mortgage which had been fully up- to-date and then refused to accept ongoing payments from the Defendants commencing November 1, 2018 placing the mortgage in default.</P>
<P>2. The Defendants have replacement financing to replace the outstanding principal and interest of the Plaintiff's mortgage but dispute the entitlement of the Plaintiff to claim a three-month interest penalty and administration fees which are claimed solely based on the Plaintiff's refusal to accept payments.</P>
<P>3. The Defendants further dispute the Plaintiff's entitlement to legal costs in the circumstances.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<P>4. The Defendants took out a mortgage from the Plaintiff to be secured as against two residential real estate properties in May, 2017. The mortgage was subsequently renewed and came due on November 1, 2018.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of Yao Jun Situ, sworn April 26, 2019 [&ldquo;Situ Affidavit&rdquo;] at paras 4-5, page 2 of the Responding Motion Record</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. All mortgage payments were made on time during the currency of the Mortgage.
<P1><BOLD>Situ Affidavit at para 5, page 2 of the Responding Motion Record</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. Following the renewal date for the mortgage, the Plaintiff refused to accept ongoing payments. The Defendants actively attempted to obtain replacement financing and have now obtained that replacement financing from the Equitable Trust Company.
<P1><BOLD>Situ Affidavit at paras 6-7, page 2 of the Responding Motion Record</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. The Defendants dispute the entitlement of the Plaintiff to claim a three -month interest penalty and administrative fees and their legal fees as all of these were generated by the Plaintiff's action in refusing to accept ongoing payments.
<P1><BOLD>Situ Affidavit at paras 10&ndash;12, page 3 of the Responding Motion Record</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE LAW</TI>
<P>8. The mortgage clause under which the Plaintiff claims entitlement to a three-month interest penalty and administrative fees is the following:
<QUOTE><P>Upon default of any payment of any fees due under the mortgage and/or any interest and/or principal secured by the Charge/mortgage the principal amount secured by the Charge/mortgage shall, at the option of the Mortgagee(s), immediately become payable and/or interest under the Charge/mortgage, while in default, shall be calculated at 28% per annum. Upon default of payment of the Principal Due at maturity the balance of the principal and interest secured by the Charge/mortgage shall, at the option of the Mortgagee(s), immediately become due and payable.</P>
<P>The Mortgagee(s) may in writing at any time or times after default of payment of principal, interest, and/or fees due may waive such default and any such waiver shall apply only to the particular default waived and shall not operate as a waiver of any other or future default.</P>
<P>For each Notice of Sale under Mortgage issued by the Mortgagee(s) there shall be an administration charge of Fifteen Hundred Dollar ($1,500.00) payable by the Mortgagor(s) to the Mortgagee(s). In addition of each Statement of Claim under Mortgage issued by the Mortgagee(s) there shall be an additional administration charge of Fifteen Hundred Dollar ($1,500.00) payable by the Mortgagor(s) to the Mortgagee(s). in addition, on the issuing of a Notice of Sale or filing a Statement of Claim, the Mortgagee(s) shall be entitled to collect as liquidated damages from the Mortgagor(s) a sum equal to the payment of three (3) months' interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Mortgagee(s) shall also be entitled to charge a monthly charge equal to any late payment charge provided for in this mortgage from the date of default until the date that the Mortgagor(s) otherwise redeems the mortgage or the date that the property is sold under Power of Sale.</P>
<P>In addition, for each Notice of sale under Mortgage issued by the Mortgagee(s) there shall be a charge of Fifteen Hundred Dollar ($1,500.00) plus GST/HST &amp; Disbursements payable by the Mortgagor(s) to the Mortgagee(s)'s lawyer for the preparation and issuing of the Notice of Sale under Mortgage. For each Statement of Claim under Mortgage issued by the Mortgagee(s) there shall be a charge of Fifteen Hundred Dollar ($1,500.00) plus GST/HST &amp; Disbursements payable by the Mortgagor(s) to the Mortgagee(s)'s lawyer for the preparation and issuing of the Statement of Claim under Mortgage. These fees shall be in addition to any legal fees or other costs associated with the Mortgagee(s) herein asserting its rights under this mortgage upon any default by the Mortgagor(s). the Mortgagor(s) shall also be liable for the Mortgagee(s)'s legal fees, disbursements and GST/HST on a solicitor-client basis for any steps taken after the issuing of the Notice of Sale including but not limited to any negotiations, court applications, eviction proceedings, listing and sale of the property.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. It is submitted that the three-month interest penalty clause in this mortgage is similar to the one that was considered by the Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Ialongo v. Serm Investments Limited</SOC></CASEREF> and in <CASEREF><SOC>58 Cardill Inc. v. Rathcliffe Holdings Limited</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>10. The three-month interest clause is derived from section 17 of the <EM>Mortgages Act</EM> which is intended to provide a remedy to mortgagors in default.</P>
<P>11. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ialongo v. Serm Investments Limited</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court confirmed
<QUOTE><P>the rights afforded by section 17 of the <EM>Mortgages Act</EM> are options made available to the mortgagor on default: it can give notice or pay the bonus prior to the expiry of the notice period. Once, however, the mortgagee takes steps to realize on its security such as by issuing a notice of sale, it cannot convert the rights of the mortgagor under section 17 of the <EM>Mortgages Act</EM> into obligations under the mortgage</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Caroline Luce Ialongo et al. v. Serm Investments Limited</SOC><CITE>2007 CanLii 6242</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>at para 30, page 8 of the Brief of Authorities</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM> provides as follows:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>8.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>No fine, penalty or rate of interest shall be stipulated for, taken, reserved or exacted on any arrears of principal or interest secured by mortgage on real property .... that has the effect of increasing the charge on the arrears beyond the rate of interest payable on principal money not in arrears.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Interest Act</EM>, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-15, section 8</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. The Courts have found that a three-month interest penalty does not offend the <EM>Interest Act</EM> where it provides the option to the mortgagor of either providing three-months' notice or paying the three-month interest penalty.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mastercraft Properties Ltd. et al. v. El Ef Investments Inc.</SOC><CITE>1993 Canlii 8545</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>pages 16-17 of the Brief of Authorities</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Justice Sanfilippo in <EM>58 Cardill Inc</EM>. noted as follows:
<QUOTE><P>I accept the respondent's submission that the Three-Month Interest Provision does not constitute a penalty or fine, because it requires only the payment of three month's interest when this interest is not paid during the notice period, and is therefore a valid and enforceable mortgage term. This is clear from <CASEREF><SOC>Mastercraft Properties Limited v. EL EF Investments Inc.</SOC><YEAR>1993</YEAR><CITE>14 O.R. (3d) 519</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, wherein it was determined that a mortgage clause substantively similar if not identical to the Three-Month Interest Provision does not offend s.8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I&ndash;15, which prohibits that payment of a fine, penalty or rate of interest on arrears of principal or interest that increases the charge on the arrears beyond the rate of interest payable under the mortgage.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>58 <CASEREF><SOC>Cardill Inc. v. Rathcliffe Holdings Limited</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 6828</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>page 29 of the Brief of Authorities</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. Here, however, the mortgagee is refusing to accept payments forcing the Defendants into arrears. Clearly the effect of the three-month interest clause and the administrative fees are to increase the rate of interest on the arrears. They are in the nature of a penalty, which is prohibited under section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM>.</P>
<P>16. It is well-established that the intent of section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM> is to prevent punitive interest on default. The Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the purpose of section 8(1) was to relieve against penalties in any form for default, whether or not any principal not in arrears remains unpaid.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Beauchamp v. Timberland Investment Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1983 Canlii 1816</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <BOLD>pages 40-41 of the Brief of Authorities</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>P.A.R.C.E.L. Inc. v. Acquaviva</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 311 (Canlii)</CITE><PARANUM>48 and 51</PARANUM></CASEREF>, <BOLD>pages 58&ndash;60 of the Brief of Authorities</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. It is submitted that in these circumstances where the Defendants have been forced into default by the refusal of the Plaintiff to accept ongoing interest payments that they are not entitled to recover the three-month interest penalty nor the administrative fees they seek to charge.</P>
<P>18. It is further submitted that the Plaintiff should not be entitled to his legal costs given its behaviour in this matter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>19. The Defendants seek an Order permitting them to pay the outstanding principal and interest due to the Plaintiff, but otherwise requiring the Plaintiff to provide a discharge of mortgage.</P>
<P>20. The Motion of the Plaintiff should be otherwise dismissed with costs to the Defendant.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</TI>
<P>1. By way of a consent court ordered timetable dated March 26, 2019 the parties agreed to a schedule regarding the exchange of materials for the herein summary judgment motion. The defendants were ordered to serve its responding motion record on April 12, 2019 but did not do so until nearly three weeks later on April 30, 2019. The defendants were ordered to serve its responding factum by April 26, 2019 but did not do so until May 6, 2019. The plaintiff submits that the defendants materials should be found inadmissible as they are in breach of a court order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">REPLY TO DEFENDANTS RESPONDING MATERIALS</TI>
<P>2. The Defendants asserted in paragraph 6-7 of the Defendants' affidavit of Yao Jun Situ that they offered a new mortgage to the Plaintiff and that the Plaintiff refused. The Defendants have asserted that they have been actively attempting to obtain replacement financing in order to discharge the mortgage. This is a private mortgage and there is no obligation by the Plaintiff to agree to renew same.</P>
<P>3. In fact, as set-out at paragraph 8 of the Plaintiff's affidavit of Egor Ivandaev, the Plaintiff contacted / reminded the Defendants on four occasions in writing (including a lawyer's letter) before the expiry of the mortgage that the Plaintiff was not willing to renew the mortgage. The defendants were advised that they must payout the mortgage in full on or before November 1, 2018. The defendants failed to do so and are therefore in default.</P>
<P>4. According to the affidavit of Yao Jun Situ at paragraphs 9-10 the Defendants dispute the (a) three month interest amount (b) administrative fees and (c) legal fees. The Defendants have not submitted any law to dispute the administrative fees that are set-out in the mortgage contract as agreed between the parties. The Defendants have not disputed the amount of the legal fees in dispute; only that the Plaintiff should not be entitled to legal fees in general.</P>
<P>5. The Defendants have asserted that Plaintiff is not entitled to three months' worth of interest based on the legal interpretation of section 17 of the <EM>Mortgages Act</EM> (&ldquo;section 17&rdquo;). In particular, they have asserted that section 17 is intended to provide a remedy to mortgagors in default and not primarily for the benefit of the mortgagee. It has been submitted that once the mortgagee takes steps to realize on its security such as by issuing a notice of sale, it cannot convert the rights of the mortgagor under section into obligations under the mortgage.</P>
<P>6. The cases cited by the Defendants to support this proposition all specifically address situations in which the mortgagee is solely relying on section 17 in order to seek relief to obtain the three-month interest obligation. The crux of these decisions is that the mortgagee is not entitled to seek the relief sought specifically under section 17. The decisions relied upon by the Defendants do not address or invalidate the contractual rights as set-out by the parties as it pertains to three months interest clauses. In many of the decisions in which this issue was litigated, there was not a specific provision in the contract that addressed a mortgagee's right to three month's worth of interest upon default of the mortgage. The mortgagee had been relying solely on section 17.</P>
<P>7. The Defendants have asserted that the three-month interest provision in these circumstances would be considered a penalty prohibited under section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM> on the basis that the mortgagee forced the Plaintiffs into arears. The Defendants have agreed that in general that the three-month interest provision does not offend the <EM>Interest Act</EM>.</P>
<P>8. The Defendants have not cited any case law that supports their proposition that the three month interest provision in the herein case violates section 8 the <EM>Interest Act</EM>. The cases cited by the Plaintiffs in their materials address factual scenarios in which it was found that there is an excessive escalation of the interest rate as follows: (a) in <CASEREF><SOC>P.A.R.C.E.L Inc v.

The defendants took issue with a default/pre-payment charge in the amount of $9,843.75 included on the discharge statement. That sum is based upon the following clause in the Standard Charge Terms under the mortgage:
<QUOTE><P>The Chargor agrees that should this Charge not be discharged on the &ldquo;Balance Due Date&rdquo; or if the Chargor fails to renew/extend this Charge on or before the &ldquo;Balance Due Date&rdquo; together with the applicable renewal/extension fees or if the Chargees commence an action due under any default of the Charge, that the Chargees, in additional to all the revenues available, at their options shall be entitled to charge an additional amount equal to the payment of three months interest on the principal then outstanding.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>10. The court found that the bonus payment is not a &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; or a &ldquo;rate of interest&rdquo; charged on the interest arrears, but rather a payment the mortgagor is required to make for the privilege of retiring the mortgage without providing three months' notice. The court found that the terms of the mortgage are enforceable as it relates the three-month interest charge. There was no violation of section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM> and no finding that there was any violation of section 17 of the <EM>Mortgage Act</EM>. The plaintiffs were found to be entitled to claim the three months' interest payment upon default.</P>
<P>11. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Piesok v. Johnson</SOC></CASEREF> (2010)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Piesok v. Johnson</SOC><YEAR>2010</YEAR><CITE>ONSC 1284 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>20&ndash;30</PARANUM></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the court found a clause in the mortgage contract allowed for the imposition of a charge of three months of interest in the event of realization by the mortgagee.</P>
<P>12. In the Court of Appeal decision of <CASEREF><SOC>1220510 Ontario Inc v. Radium-O</SOC></CASEREF> (2017)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1220510 Ontario Inc v. Radium-O</SOC><YEAR>2017</YEAR><CITE>ONCA 490 (Can LII)</CITE></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the motgagee 1220510 Ontario Inc. lent $6,000,000 to the mortgagor in a vendor take back mortgage. The mortgage matured on May 7, 2016. The appellant had not paid the principal owing and was in default as of that date. The respondent started an application for the appointment of a receiver. After some negotiations, the respondent made a settlement offer for a total amount of $6,162,950.45. This amount included principal, interest, three months' interest compensation, receivership and legal fees, other fees and, taxes. The mortgagor made the payment and thereafter commenced a counter-application seeking to be relieved of paying the three months' interest compensation and receivership costs.</P>
<P>13. As it relates to the three month's interest compensation, an agreement to settle an action is a contract. The Court of Appeal found that there was offer and explicit acceptance. The requirement to pay the three months worth of interest was upheld on the basis of an enforceable contract. While as the <EM>1220510 Ontario Inc</EM> case deals with a contract that was entered into subsequent to the commencement of litigation, the principles remain the same in relation to there herein case. The parties in the case at bar entered into a mortgage contract and one of the terms was that were the mortgagor to default on the contract that &ldquo;the mortgagee shall be entitled to collect as liquidated damages from the Mortgagor(s)'s sum equal to the payment of three (3) months' interest on the principal amount outstanding&rdquo;.</P>
<P>14. Further, in <EM>1220510 Ontario Inc</EM> the mortgagor contended that the motion judge erred by approving the costs and fees relating to the respondent's steps in pursuit of the appointment of a receiver. The mortgagor argued that these cost and fees were in the nature of a penalty and violated section 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM>. The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments and found that the steps taken to potentially appoint a receiver were entirely reasonable in light of the appellant's default. The Court of Appeal also found that: &ldquo;And the three month's interest compensation did not violate s. 8 of the <EM>Interest Act</EM>: see <CASEREF><SOC>Master craft Properties Ltd. v. EL EF Investments Inc.</SOC><YEAR>1993</YEAR><CITE>1993 CanLII 8545</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>14 O.R.

However, this does prevent the mortgagee having recourse as to the terms of the mortgage. &ldquo;In the present case, and applying the approach taken in <CASEREF><SOC>Ialongo v. Serm Investments Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, once the Defendants issued their Notice of Sale they could rely only on the remedies set out in the mortgage and not on any additional &ldquo;bonus interest&rdquo; said to be owing under s. 17 of the [Mortgage] <EM>Act</EM>.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK2>
