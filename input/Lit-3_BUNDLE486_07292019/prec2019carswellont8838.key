<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS (THE PLAINTIFFS) APPEAL</BOLD> to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court from the appeal decision of The Honourable Justice N. Jane Wilson dated the 4<SUP>th</SUP> day of April, 2018, made at Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANTS ASK</BOLD> that the appeal decision of The Honourable Justice N. Jane Wilson be overturned, and the decision of Master Donald E. Short, dated August 25, 2017, be overturned, as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Respondent's (Defendant's) cross-motion is dismissed, where the Court <UNDER>cannot</UNDER> order separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages, where the Plaintiffs do not consent to bifurcate the trial;</P>
<P>2. Costs of the appeal; and</P>
<P>3. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Honourable Justice N. Jane Wilson:
<P1>a. Erred in law in her interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> to find that the Court could order separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages, where the Appellants (Plaintiffs) do not consent to bifurcate the trial;</P1>
<P1>b. Erred in law in her interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> to find that the Rule limited the Court's jurisdiction to bifurcate <UNDER>jury trials only</UNDER>, despite the fact that the plain reading of the Rule informs that it applies to all trials;</P1>
<P1>c. Erred in law in finding that Master Donald E. Short was not bound by the finding of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al v Potrebic et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF>;</P1>
<P1>d. Erred in relying heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2015] 1 SCR 331</CITE></CASEREF>, despite the fact that the case was not before the Court and neither party was given the opportunity to make submissions on it; and she,</P1>
<P1>e. Erred in upholding Master Donald E. Short's conclusion that the Defendant had satisfied the high threshold to justify bifurcation in this case, despite concluding that bifurcation is appropriate only in the most exceptional cases.</P1></P>
<P>2. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. Clause 19 (1)(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>;</P>
<P>2. Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>; and,</P>
<P>3. Leave to appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court granting leave to appeal, dated October 11, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>FACTUM OF THE APPELLANTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I&mdash;HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This appeal concerns the right of an infant plaintiff and his mother to have the entirety of their trial heard in a single procedure.</P>
<P>2. This action arises out of a incident on September 12, 2010 in which the Plaintiff, [G.D.] [G.D.] then only four years old, opened a defective sliding balcony door of a rental unit owned by the Defendant, climbed up over a balcony railing, and fell 10&ndash;15 feet to the ground below. As a result of this fall, [G.D.] suffered an undisplaced skull fracture and a closed head injury. This head injury has developed into a number of psychological, behavioural and developmental issues, but the full extent of the brain injury sequelae is unclear.</P>
<P>3. The Plaintiffs brought a motion for extension of time to set the within action down for trial from March 21, 2017 to March 21, 2020. The Defendant brought a cross-motion seeking an order bifurcating the trial on the issues of liability and damages, pursuant to Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. Both parties opposed each other's motions, returnable May 8, 2017.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <BOLD>Decision of Master Short</BOLD>, Appellants' Appeal Book and Compendium, at Tab 7.</P1></P>
<P>4. Master Donald E. Short granted each parties' order in his reasons of August 25, 2017.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <BOLD>Decision of Master Short</BOLD>, Appellants' Appeal Book and Compendium, at Tab 7.</P1></P>
<P>5. The Plaintiffs appealed the Order of Master Short. The appeal hearing was heard by Honourable Justice N. Janet Wilson on February 26, 2018. Justice Wilson released her decision on April 4, 2018. She denied the Plaintiffs' appeal but stated that the case law interpreting Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> was inconsistent and confusing. She advised that there was a need for clarification by appellate authority.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <BOLD>Decision of Justice Wilson</BOLD>, Appellants' Appeal Book and Compendium, at Tab 5.</P1></P>
<P>6. The Plaintiffs sought leave to appeal Justice Wilson's decision to the Divisional Court. On October 11, 2018 leave was granted.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <BOLD>Order Granting Leave to Appeal to the Divisional Court</BOLD>, at Tab 2.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P><BOLD>ISSUE 1:</BOLD> What is the standard of review for this appeal?</P>

<P>8. Case law prior to the enactment of Rule 6.1.01 cautioned that the Court's jurisdiction to bifurcate trials be narrowly circumscribed and exercised in only the clearest of cases, where it was in the interest of justice to do so. Jurisprudence noted that the Court should be slow to exercise the power in the face of an objection by one of the parties.

<P>9. in November 2007, former Associate Chief Justice Coulter Osbourne made recommendations to the Rules Committee regarding changes to be made to the civil justice system. Regarding bifurication, the following recommendation was made:
<QUOTE><P>The Civil Rules Committee should consider addressing bifurcation in a rule that would permit an order for bifurcation to be made on motion by any party or on the court's own initiative, after hearing from the parties. Any rule permitting bifurcation could reference some or all of the 14 factors listed in <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>9. <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF> was a case where the plaintiff's motor vehicle and a train collided. There were numerous defendants and third parties - including the Canadian National Railway Company and two municipalities. In Justice Tobias' 1993 decision, bifurcation was denied. The following factors were considered:
<P1>i. are the issues to be tried simple;</P1>
<P1>ii. are the issues of liability clearly separate from the issues of damages;</P1>
<P1>iii. is the factual structure upon which the action is based so extraordinary and exceptional that there is good reason to depart from normal practice requiring that liability and damages be tried together;</P1>
<P1>iv. does the issue of causation touch equally upon the issues of liability and damages;</P1>
<P1>v. will the trial judge be better able to deal with the issues of the injuries of the plaintiff and his financial losses by reason of having first assessed the credibility of the plaintiff during the trial of the issue of damages;</P1>
<P1>vi. can a better appreciation of the nature and extent of injuries and consequential damage to the plaintiff be more easily reached by trying the issues together;</P1>
<P1>vii. are the issues of liability and damages so inextricably bound together that they ought not to be severed;</P1>
<P1>viii. if the issues of liability and damages are severed, are facilities in place which will permit these two separate issues to be tried expeditiously before one court or before two separate courts, as the case may be;</P1>
<P1>ix. is there a clear advantage to all parties to have liability tried first;</P1>
<P1>x. will there be a substantial saving of costs;</P1>
<P1>xi. is it certain that the splitting of the case will save time, or will it lead to unnecessary delay;</P1>
<P1>xii. has there been an agreement by the parties to the action on the quantum of damages;</P1>
<P1>xiii. if a split be ordered, will the result of the trial on liability cause other plaintiffs in companion actions, based on the same facts, to withdraw or settle; and,</P1>
<P1>xiv. is it likely that the trials on liability will put an end to the action.

<P>19. The Defendant seeks to have separate hearings for liability and damages. The Plaintiffs do not consent.</P>
<P>20. This is not a case where Rule 5.05 applies - there is only one Defendant, one proceeding, and one cause of action. When considering bifurcation, the Court <UNDER>must</UNDER> consider Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P>
<P>21. Bifurcation is the extreme exception to the rule against multiplicity of proceedings.</P>
<P>22. The following is an exhaustive list of cases where motions were brought, pursuant to Rule 6.1.01, and bifurcation was denied:
<P1>i. <CASEREF><SOC>Trinity Anglican Church v. Janeiro</SOC><CITE>[2012] OJ. No. 3791</CITE></CASEREF>, BOA Tab 9.</P1>

<P>23. Where the parties consent to bifurcation of the trial, a motion is still required for the Court to consider whether the bifurcation order should be granted. The Court may chose not to bifurcate the trial, even if the parties consent. Such an Order would be similar to the Court refusing to grant an adjournment of a trial or refusing to transfer the location of a trial, even where the parties consent to the remedy sought. The wording of Rule 6.1.01 maintains the Court's inherent jurisdiction to deny bifurcation if it is not in the inter est of justice to do so.</P>
<P>24. In this way, the wording of Rule 6.1.01 clearly stipulates that the consent of the parties is a condition precedent to the Court considering whether or not bifurcation should be ordered. Crucially, there is no distinction drawn between jury and non-jury proceedings in the language of the Rule, which is plain and unambiguous on its face.</P>
<P>25. Only after the parties consent to bifurcation does the Court apply the factors set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>. It does not have inherent jurisdiction to make the determination where the condition precedent of consent is not present.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para. 30. BOA, Tab 5.</P1></P>
<P>26. The Rules Committee expressly narrowed the Court's jurisdiction to order bifurcation of trials in enacting Rule 6.1.01. The Court can exercise its inherent jurisdiction in a manner that does not conflict with the Rules or Statute. Further, a court's authority to invoke its inherent jurisdiction is to be used sparingly, and only in a clear case in which justice and fairness compel such recourse.

<P>30. In drafting Rule 6.1.01, the Rules committee specifically required the consent of the parties prior to bifurcation. Explicit wording informs the Court that consent of all parties is required under Rule 6.1.01, especially in comparison to Rule 5.05, which provides the Court with broader jurisdiction to bifurcate where the joinder of multiple claims or parties in the same proceeding may unduly complicate or delay the hearing or cause undue prejudice to a party.</P>
<P>31. The ordinary meaning of a statutory provision is important. Use of different words implies a legislative intention to express different meanings. As noted in <CASEREF><SOC>Teal Cedar Products Ltd. v.

<P>33. Master Short and Justice Wilson both concluded that <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, caused a fundamental shift in the parameters of how civil litigation is to be conducted. This interpretation of <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF> is too broad. The Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, found that the summary judgment motion judge correctly applied his powers pursuant to Rule 20.04 (2.1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. The Court concluded that Rule 20 was amended in 2010 to improve access to justice. The issue to be determined on a summary judgement is whether or not there is a genuine issue requiring a trial. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the summary judgment rules must be interpreted broadly, favouring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely and just adjudication of claims.

The Court was not asked to consider bifurcation or Rule 6.1.01 in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>. The Regulation changing the summary judgment Rule that was upheld and interpreted in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, is the same Regulation that enacted Rule 6.1.01 - O.

<QUOTE><P>The majority of the Divisional Court held, at paras. 37-38, that a judge did not have inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate a <UNDER>trial</UNDER> into a determination of liability and a damage assessment without the consent of the parties. [Emphasis in Original]</P></QUOTE>

<P>35. At paragraphs 25 and 26, this Honourable Court's majority decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF> stated:
<QUOTE><P>...the clear intent of the Rule was to require consent before any trial could be bifurcated, whether jury or judge alone. The Rule itself makes no distinction between a jury trial and a non-jury trial. If the effect of the new Rule is that there can be bifurcation of a jury trial, but only on consent of all parties, that effect must apply equally to all trials, whether jury or non-jury.</P>
<P>In my view, such an interpretation is also consistent with a plain and ordinary reading of the Rule. The Rules Committee clearly intended to impose a Rule as to when a judge has the power to exercise a discretion with respect to bifurcation of a trial. That discretion, according to the Rule, only arises where the parties consent.</P></QUOTE>

<P>37. In writing for the panel, Justice Blair provided clarity on the newly enacted Rule 6.1.01. Justice Blair's direction on the Rule does not differentiate between jury and non jury trials. In fact, Justice Blair specifically stated that Rule 6.1.01 includes a judge's ability to bifurcate jury trials, on consent of the parties, despite the fact that pervious case law stood for the proposition that jury trials could never by bifurcated:
<QUOTE><P>Rule 6.1.01&mdash;effective January 1, 2010&mdash;is the first time a rule speaking to bifurcation has been promulgated. It signals that, in the opinion of the Rules Committee at least, the bifurcation of a trial, jury or non-jury, is not generally a good idea unless the parties consent. To repeat, rule 6.1.01 states:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>6.1.01</N><SECP>With the consent of the parties, the court may order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>This new rule may well permit the bifurcation of issues of fact or of mixed fact and law even where a jury notice has been filed, where the parties consent, thus surmounting the jurisdictional impediments previously in place.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>

<P>40. <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF> was a unanimous decision. Leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused.

<P>41. Justice Blair's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF> must be found to be persuasive, if not binding, on all lower courts. Justice Blair's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 occurred in the framework of the Court's simultaneous consideration and analysis of all bifurcation case law dating back to 1979.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>. BOA Tab 1.</P1></P>
<P>42. Justice Molloy's majority decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF> is similarly binding on all lower courts. Justice Molloy's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 is correct. This is particularly evidenced by the fact that Chief Justice Strathy quoted the majority's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 written by Justice Molloy, verbatim, in the Court of Appeal's decision of in <CASEREF><SOC>Mars Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash &amp; Carry Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>

<P>43. Since the decision of Master Donald E. Short in this case, Justice Akbarali released her decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Robichaud et al v. Constantinidis et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, where she found that the Court was bound by the decisions of <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF>, notwithstanding <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>.
<P1><UNDER>Ref:</UNDER> <CASEREF><SOC>Robichaud v. Constantinidis</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, BOA Tab 10.</P1></P>
<P>44. Justice Wilson incorrectly applied <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (AG)</SOC></CASEREF>, in making her conclusion that she and Master Short did not need to follow the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF>. Justice Wilson was also notably silent on whether she and Master short were bound by the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF>.

<P>45. <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (AG)</SOC></CASEREF> is a 2015 Supreme Court of Canada decision in which the Court found that lower Courts were not necessarily bound by <EM>stare decisis</EM> where there has been a change in the law. The Court acknowledged that there had been a fundamental societal shift surrounding the issues of assisted suicide since it's 1993 decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>. The Court found that lower Courts are not bound by <EM>stare decisis</EM> if there is a new legal issue at bar, and if circumstances or evidence have &ldquo;fundamentally shift[ed] the parameters of the debate.&rdquo;
<P1>Ref: <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 5 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF>. BOA Tab 22.</P1></P>
<P>46. In this case, Rule 6.1.01 is not a recent and fundamental change in the law. This Honourabl e Court, as well as the Court of Appeal, have interpreted Rule 6.1.01 in the decisions of <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF>. There has been no change in the law regarding bifurcation since <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC></CASEREF> were released. This is not an appropriate case for a lower court to circumvent <EM>stare decisis</EM> pursuant to <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v. Canada (AG)</SOC></CASEREF>.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V"><UNDER>PART V&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. The Appellant therefore respectfully submits that the Honourable Justice Wilson erred in finding that the Court could exercise its inherent jurisdiction to Order bifurcation of the trial in relation to the issues of liability and damages, where Rule 6.1.01 requires the consent of both parties as a condition precedent.</P>
<P>48. The Appellant submits that these are appropriate circumstances to reverse Master Short's Order bifurcating the liability and damages of this action on the basis that Master Short made an error in his interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, and he did not have jurisdiction to make this Order where the Appellants do not consent to the bifurcation.</P>
<P>49. The Plaintiffs also request costs of this motion on a partial indemnity basis fixed and payable by the Defendant.</P>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW STATEMENT</TI>
<P>1. The Appellants/Plaintiffs appeal the decision of Justice Wilson dated April 4, 2018 upholding the August 25, 2017 decision of Master Short wherein he granted, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the Respondent's motion to bifurcate the trial on the issues of liability and damages.</P>
<P>2. The Appellants have been granted leave to appeal Justice Wilson's order on the issue of jurisdiction only.</P>
<P>3. The Respondent opposes the appeal as it takes the position that Master Short had jurisdiction to grant the bifurcation order.</P>
<P>4. The within action arises from injuries sustained by the then four-year old Plaintiff/Appellant [G.D.] when he fell 10&ndash;15 feet after climbing over a balcony railing of a unit leased to his mother by the Defendant/Respondent Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corporation on September 12, 2010.</P>
<P>5. On May 8, 2017, the Appellants brought a motion seeking to extend the time to set the within action down for trial to from March 21, 2017 to March 21, 2020. The Respondent opposed that motion and brought a cross-motion seeking bifurcation of the trial on the issues of liability and damages.</P>
<P>6. Both motions were heard by Master Short who granted:
<P1>a) The Respondent's motion to bifurcate the trial on the issues of liability and damages; and</P1>
<P1>b) The Appellants' motion for an extension of the deadline to set the action down for trial to March 31, 2020.</P1></P>
<P>7. On April 4, 2018, Justice Wilson dismissed the Appellant's appeal from the Order of Master Short on the basis that bifurcation was in the interests of justice. In doing so, she found that Master Short was correct and not bound by contrary precedent in finding that he had jurisdiction to make the bifurcation order.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>8. The Respondent accepts as correct the facts set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the Appellants' Factum.</P>
<P>9. The Respondent disagrees with the facts as they are characterized in paragraphs 1, 2 and 6 of the Appellants' Factum.</P>
<P>10. The within action arises from injuries sustained by the then four-year old Plaintiff/Appellant [G.D.] on September 12, 2010, when he fell 10&ndash;15 feet after climbing over a balcony railing of a unit leased by the Defendant/Respondent to [G.]'s mother Jessica Knight.
<P1><BOLD>Statement of Claim issued March 21, 2012, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 11, p. 64, para. 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. The Respondent accepts the contention that the extent and long-term effects of [G.]'s head injury are presently unknown.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, para. 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. The key liability issues are the reasonableness of the Respondent's inspection and maintenance of the unit and the adequacy of the supervision provided by Ms. Knight in view of [G.]'s past history of climbing onto furniture and fixtures. Relevant expert reports and records have been exchanged and relevant witnesses have been identified.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 10, p. 54, para. 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. The Respondent's employees with knowledge of the liability issues are elderly and have long been retired. Additionally, the former superintendent who carried out all of the unit inspections and repairs before and after [G.]'s fall was in poor health the last time he was seen by the Respondent's property manager.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 10, p. 57, paras. 20-21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. On May 8, 2017, the Appellants brought a motion seeking to extend the time to set the within action down for trial from March 21, 2017 to March 21, 2020. The Respondent opposed that motion and brought a cross-motion seeking bifurcation of the trial on the issues of liability and damages.

<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Master Short, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7, p. 27, paras. 7-8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. Both motions were heard by Master Short who granted:
<P1>a) The Respondent's motion to bifurcate the trial on the issues of liability and damages; and</P1>
<P1>b) The Appellants' motion for an extension of the deadline to set the action down for trial to March 31, 2020.
<P2><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Master Short dated August 25, 2017, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7, p. 40, para. 85.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>16. Master Short found that bifurcation was in the interests of justice and would furthermore have the significant advantage of potentially rendering unnecessary a lengthy and complex damages trial.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Master Short dated August 25, 2017, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 7, p. 31, para. 36 and p. 36, para. 59.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. On April 4, 2018, Justice Wilson dismissed the Appellant's appeal from the Order of Master Short on the basis that bifurcation was in the interests of justice. In doing so, she found that Master Short was correct and not bound by contrary precedent in finding that he had jurisdiction to make the bifurcation order.

<P>18. On October 11, 2018, the Appellants were granted leave to bring the within appeal of Justice Wilson's decision but only with respect to the issue of whether the Master had jurisdiction to bifurcate. Leave to appeal the issue of whether bifurcation ought to have been ordered, leaving aside the issue of jurisdiction, was specifically dismissed.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>19. The Position of the Respondent with respect to each issue raised by the Appellant is as follows:</P>
<P><BOLD>ISSUE 1:</BOLD> What is the standard of review for this appeal?</P>
<P>Respondent's Position: The Respondent agrees that the applicable standard of review is correctness.</P>
<P><BOLD>ISSUE 2:</BOLD> Did the Honourable Justice Wilson err in law in her interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 to find that the Court could exercise its inherent jurisdiction to order separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages, even where the Appellants (Plaintiffs) do not consent to bifurcate the trial?</P>
<P>Respondent's Position: No</P>
<P><BOLD>ISSUE 3:</BOLD> Did the Honourable Justice Wilson err in her interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 to find that the Rule was intended to limit the Court's jurisdiction to bifurcate jury trials only?</P>
<P>Respondent's Position: No</P>
<P><BOLD>ISSUE 4:</BOLD> Did the Honourable Justice Wilson err in law in finding that Master Short was not bound by the finding of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al v. Potrebic et al.</SOC></CASEREF>, and the Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach v. Linn</SOC></CASEREF>?</P>
<P>Respondent's Position: No</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Issue"><N>1:</N><TI>The Standard of Review is Correctness</TI>
<P>20. The Respondent agrees that the standard of review for an appeal of a judge's order on pure questions of law is that of correctness. On questions of mixed fact and law and factual findings, the standard of review is palpable and overriding error, in which case considerable deference should be given and the lower court's decision should not be overturned unless there is evidence of &ldquo;overriding and palpable error&rdquo;.

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Issue"><N>2:</N><TI>The Correct Interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 is that the Rule does not oust the Court's Inherent Jurisdiction in relation to Bifurcation</TI>
<P>21. Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> provides that:
<QUOTE><P>With the consent of the parties, the court may order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> RRO 1990, Reg 194, R. 6.1.01, Appellants' Factum, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1></P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Law Regarding Bifurcation prior to the Enactment of Rule 6.1.01</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. It was universally accepted prior to the enactment of Rule 6.1.01 that the court had inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate a proceeding in accordance with the 14 factors set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>. That jurisdiction was generally not exercised where one of the parties had served a jury notice. In non-jury cases, the court's inherent jurisdiction was exercised in exceptional cases.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Elcano Acceptance Ltd. v. Richmond, Richmond, Stambler and Mills</SOC><CITE>(1989) 55 OR (2d) 56</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 2.</BOLD></P1>

<P>23. The inherent jurisdiction of the court has been described as follows:
<QUOTE><P>As a superior court of general jurisdictions, the [Superior] Court of Ontario has all the powers that are necessary to do justice between the parties. Except where provided specifically to the contrary, the Court's jurisdiction is unlimited and unrestricted to substantive law in civil matters.</P></QUOTE>

Bahlieda</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 138</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 17, p. 11, para. 48.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. The inherent jurisdiction of the court is a residual source of power derived from the very nature of the court as a superior court of law which the court may draw upon as necessary to prevent its process from being obstructed and abused and to secure a fair trial between the parties.

<P>25. The Court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction in substantive matters, e.g., ordering a defence medical examination outside the authority for same provided in the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, as well as of procedural matters, .e.g., the manner in which an examination mandated by the Act is carried out.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ziebenhaus v. Bahlieda</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 138</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appellant's Book of Authorities, Tab 17, p. 14-15, paras. 64-65.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. In <CASEREF><SOC>Woodbury (Litigation Guardian of) v. Woodbury</SOC></CASEREF>, Master Muir considered the factors set out <EM>Bourne</EM> in separating the issue of liability from the issue of damages. In concluding that the proceeding ought to bifurcated, Master Muir considered the complexity of the damages aspects as compared to the relatively simple issues on liability and the fact that there would be a significant saving in time and expense if the defendant was successful on liability. The combination of these factors indicated that a severance of issues for trial was an effective way to facilitate a more just, expeditious and less costly disposition of the trial process. Master Muir's decision was upheld on appeal by Justice Morgan who agreed with Master Muir's decision finding that the conclusion was consistent with the principle set out in Rule 1.04 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> in that bifurcation was the only way &ldquo;to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.&rdquo;

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Enactment of Rule 6.1.01</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. In 2006, former Attorney General, Michael Bryant, asked then Ontario Associate Chief Justice Coulter Osborne to lead the Civil Justice Reform Project (&ldquo;CJRP&rdquo;) to propose options that would reform the civil justice system to make it more accessible and affordable for Ontarians. In developing its recommendations, the CJRP was instructed to take into account four guiding principles:
<P1>1. Access: Recommendations should promote access to justice for both represented and unrepresented litigants;</P1>
<P1>2. Proportionality: Recommendations should reflect the principle that the time and expense devoted to civil proceedings should be proportionate to the amount in dispute and the importance of the issues at stake;</P1>
<P1>3. One size does not fit all: Recommendations should recognize diversity and the different issues facing different jurisdictions, particularly larger urban centres such as Toronto; and</P1>
<P1>4. Culture of litigation: Recommendations should recognize that rule and other regulatory reform alone might not adequately respond to problems in the system. Ways to foster &ldquo;cultural change&rdquo; among the bench and bar should be considered.

<P>28. Rule 6.1.01 was a recommendation of the CJRP. In Justice Osborne's report of recommendations to the Civil Rules Committee, he touched upon the issue of having a rule that would address power to order bifurcated proceedings. On this topic, Justice Osborne stated:
<QUOTE><P>The power to order issues in an action to be split into two or more trials is not expressly conferred by statute or the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. The power to order bifurcated proceedings appears to exist as part of the inherent jurisdiction of the court. In the leading case, the Court of Appeal held that it is a &ldquo;basic right&rdquo; of a litigant to have all issues in dispute resolved in one trial and that bifurcation must therefore be regarded as &ldquo;a narrowly circumscribed power.&rdquo;<SUP>96</SUP> In a later case, <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court (General Division) listed fourteen criteria that the court should consider when evaluating the merits of a motion to sever liability from damages. The catalogue of factors set out in <EM>Bourne</EM>, though not an exhaustive list, is generally taken into account in determining whether bifurcation should be allowed. A decision of the Divisional Court suggests that a party's inability to fund the litigation is an &ldquo;extraneous&rdquo; factor that should not be considered when deciding whether to bifurcate a trial.<SUP>98</SUP></P>
<P>While I view bifurcation to be the exception, cost considerations militate in favour of bifurcation in some cases. In commercial litigation, for example, when dealing with damages will expose a party and sometimes all parties to significant costs, it may make sense to separate the issues of liability and damages and deal with liability first. Upon the determination of one issue, parties may be inclined to settle the balance of the issues in dispute. This can result in a significant savings of time, money and judicial resources. It would also be of particular benefit to those litigants who cannot afford a trial of all issues.</P>
<P>The Civil Rules Committee should consider addressing bifurcation in a rule that would permit an order for bifurcation to be made on motion by any party or on the court's own initiative, after hearing from the parties. Any rule permitting bifurcation could reference some or all of the 14 factors listed in <CASEREF><SOC>Bourne v. Saunby</SOC></CASEREF>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Osborne Report, ibid</EM> at Pre-Trials and Trial Management.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. Justice's Osbourne's commentary suggests that the recommendation to allow bifurcated civil proceedings is predicated on principles of proportionality, flexibility and affordability of the civil justice system. Allowing bifurcated proceedings recognizes that there are cases where the issues of liability and damages are so disproportionate in terms of time, cost, complexity that separating the issues would, in fact, result in the most just, cost-effective and expeditious use of time and resources.</P>
<P>30. The Appellants contend that Rule 6.1.01 ousted the inherent jurisdiction the court previously exercised in relation to bifurcation.
<P1><BOLD>Appellant's Factum, paras. 19&ndash;34</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. The law on this issue is that the ousting of the court's inherent jurisdiction has to be &ldquo;clear and precise&rdquo;. As stated by the court in <CASEREF><SOC>Ziebenhaus v. Bahlieda</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>Characterizing the issue by reference to whether legislation has &ldquo;occupied the field&rdquo; is either conclusory or misleading. The more appropriate, and precise, characterization of the scope of the court's inherent jurisdiction was addressed in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Rose</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 768</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1998] 3 S.C.R. 262</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> where it is stated that, if the court's inherent jurisdiction is to be removed, that can only be accomplished by &ldquo;clear and precise language&rdquo;. This statement is also reflected in the decision of L'Heureux-Dube in Rose at para. 64 who, in affirming that Parliament can exclude the court's inherent jurisdiction by &ldquo;clear and precise statutory language indicating the contrary&rdquo;, cited and affirmed the following passage in I.H. Jacob, &ldquo;The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court&rdquo; (1970) 23 Curr. Legal Pubs. 23 (the &ldquo;Jacob Article&rdquo;), at p. 24:</P>
<P>As a common law concept, the inherent jurisdiction is subject to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. In I. H. Jacob, &ldquo;The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court&rdquo; (1970), 23 Cum Legal Probs. 23, the author states at p. 24:</P>
<P>Moreover, the term &ldquo;inherent jurisdiction of the court&rdquo; is not used in contradistinction to the jurisdiction conferred on the court by statute. The contrast is not between the common law jurisdiction of the court on the one hand and its statutory jurisdiction on the other, for the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction even in respect of matters which are regulated by statute or by rule of court, so long as it can do so without contravening any statutory provision.</P></QUOTE>

<P>33. Justice Corbett's dissenting opinion <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> accords with Justice's Osbourne's vision of Rule 6.1.01. In speaking on the origins of the Rule, Justice Corbett made the following comments:
<QUOTE><P>While it would have been possible, of course, for the Rules Committee to reject the Osborne Report's recommendations outright and decide that the court's inherent jurisdiction to order separate trials was too broad as it was, this would have been a rather strange thing to do. There is no contemporary jurisprudence raising concern about overuse of, or difficulties caused by, improper use of the inherent jurisdiction to order separate trials. There is no academic commentary calling for scaling back of this power. There is no &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; at which Rule 6.1 was aimed if it is read as Molloy J. does. <BOLD>In this context, in my view, the common sense conclusion is that the Rules Committee decided to implement a portion of Justice Osborne's recommendations on this issue and not that the Rules Committee rejected the recommendations outright and narrowed the court's jurisdiction to order bifurcation.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Bondy-Rafael, ibid</EM> at p. 18-19, para. 74.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>34. Justice Corbett found that the plain meaning of Rule 6.1 did not entirely oust the court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own process. He further noted that the language of Rule 6.1 is permissive rather than exclusive.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Bondy-Rafael, ibid at</EM> p. 12&ndash;23, paras. 42&ndash;85.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. Rule 6.1 was intended to enhance the court's ability to fashion flexible and proportionate procedures, not to curtail the reasonable exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction to promote justice.
<P1><EM>Bondy-Rafael, ibid at</EM> <BOLD>p.14, para 51.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>36. Justice Corbett in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v.

Kovach</SOC></CASEREF>, noting that there is nothing in Kovach which concludes that Rule 6.1.01 completely ousts the court's jurisdiction.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Bondy-Rafael, ibid</EM> at p. 14, para. 54.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>37. In <CASEREF><SOC>Elcano Acceptance Ltd. v. Richmond</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal clearly stated that the court has inherent jurisdiction to order bifurcated trials where the interest of justice requires it.

<P>39. Justice Corbett's dissent in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> was cited with approval by Justice MacLeod in <CASEREF><SOC>Campbell v. Campbell</SOC></CASEREF>. MacLeod J. also agreed that Rule 6.1 did not stand for a universal proposition that the court does not have inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate the trial of an action. He noted the &ldquo;powerful dissent&rdquo; of Justice Corbett on the interpretation of Rule 6.1 and noted his preference for his analysis over that of the majority, noting that Corbett J's analysis was not only consistent with the trend of cases following the enactment of the Rule, but also the rationale for enacting the Rule.

<P>40. Further, in <CASEREF><SOC>Aprile Estate v. Aprile</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Molly (who authored the majority reasons in <EM>Bondy-Rafael)</EM> provided the following comments:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>Rule 6.1.01 did not come into force until 2010. The issue of bifurcation under that rule has not been dealt with by the Divisional Court in the context of an oppression case. There was a vigorous dissent in Bondy-Raphael, which was a personal injury action.</BOLD> There are important issues involved with respect to the general principles of: the desirability of finding the most expeditious and least expensive ways of resolving disputes and whether bifurcation frustrates or facilitates that; the desirability of promoting early settlement and whether that can be fully informed without complete disclosure at an early stage; whether different principles for production should be applied in commercial litigation; and the burden on parties of complicated and expensive document production that might prove to be pointless if there is no finding of oppression. These principles have broad impact beyond the issues in this particular case. <BOLD>This is an area of the law that could benefit from appellate guidance, [emphasis added]</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Aprile Estate v. Aprile</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 7898</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 5 at para. 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. The Respondent submits that given the flux in this area of the law, it was open to Master Short to apply the factual matrix of this case to achieve the most just, cost-effective and expeditious use of time and judicial resources as contemplated by Rule 1.04 and by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Hymiak</EM> (which Master Short refers to at paragraph 46 of his Reasons for Decision).

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Appellants Do Not Have an Absolute Right to One Hearing</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. While a plaintiff has a presumptive right to have all issues dealt with in a single trial, the courts have made it clear that this right <BOLD>is not</BOLD> absolute and that bifurcation of issues in an action may be necessary to minimize delay and expense, better serve the interests of justice and result in greater litigation efficiency.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Florence v. Benzaquen</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 132</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 6 at para. 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>43. Courts have repeatedly granted bifurcation orders in &ldquo;exceptional cases&rdquo;. If the Appellants' arguments are to be accepted that such orders could only be granted where the parties consented, there would no need to analyze such requests through the exceptional case lens, as the court would be entirely prevented from granting such orders other than on consent.</P>
<P>44. The fact that jurisprudence has continued to develop in this area since the 2010 amendment clearly signals that the court continues to maintain inherent jurisdiction to make such orders where the interests of justice dictate.</P>
<P>45. Further, there is no explicit requirement in Rule 6.1.01 that bifurcation can only be granted &ldquo;with the consent of the parties&rdquo;. If that were the case, the legislature would have provided language clearly stating that <UNDER>&ldquo;only</UNDER> with the consent of the parties, the court may order a separate hearing...&rdquo;</P>
<P>46. Similarly, there is nothing in Rule 6.1.01 that provides that <EM>even where</EM> the parties consent to bifurcation, the court is <UNDER>required</UNDER> to so order; rather, the Rule provides that &ldquo;the court <EM>may</EM> order a separate hearing on one or more issues in the proceeding, including separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages&rdquo;.</P>
<P>47. Absent clear, unequivocal language, the Respondent submits that the court retains its inherent jurisdiction to undertake the necessary steps outlined in <EM>Bourne</EM>, which Master Short did, to determine whether or not bifurcation should be granted, irrespective of whether the parties consent or not.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Rules 1.04 and 20 can Assist in the Interpretation of Rule 6.1.01</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. Rule 1.04 provides that the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> &ldquo;shall be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 1.0, Appellants' Factum, Schedule B, Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>49. Rule 1.04 has been described as the &ldquo;single most important Rule of Civil Procedure&rdquo; and the rule that &ldquo;guides the interpretation of all the Rules&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Griffioen v. Liao</SOC><CITE>2003 CarswellOnt 5290</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 7 at para. 14.</BOLD></P1>

<P>50. The Rule continues to be in the forefront for allowing courts to dispense with or vary application of the <EM>Rules</EM> provided that the dispensation or varied interpretation results in a just determination of the action on its merits. Courts have justified the application of Rule 1.04 on the basis that procedural rules are the servants of justice, not its masters and importance must be placed on their substance rather than their form.

<P>51. The Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Hymiak</EM> emphasized that a shift away from conventional approaches was necessary to promote the timely and affordable resolution of disputes. In <EM>Hymiak</EM>, the Court stated:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>This shift entails simplifying pretrial procedures and moving the emphasis away from the conventional trial in favour of proportional procedures tailored to the needs of the particular case.</BOLD> The balance between procedure and access struck by our justice system must come to reflect modem reality and recognize that new models of adjudication can be fair and just.</P></QUOTE>

<P>52. The intersectionality of Rule 1.04, Rule 6.1.01 and Rule 20 was addressed in <CASEREF><SOC>Fontenelle v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF> by Justice Price who commented on Master Short's discussion on the court's retention of jurisdiction to determine bifurcation in this case.

<P>53. Master Short applied the spirit and legislative intent of Rule 6.1.01, guided by the principles of Rule 1.04 and <EM>Hryniak</EM>. Master Short noted that:
<QUOTE><P>My reading of the genesis of Rule 6.1 [is that it] was intended to enhance the court's ability to fashion flexible and proportionate procedures, not to curtail the reasonable exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction to promote justice.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Rule 36.01 is Not Appropriate in the Circumstances</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. At paragraph 33 of his decision, Master Short considered and correctly rejected the Appellant's suggestion that the Respondent take the evidence of its witnesses in advance of trial under Rule 36.01. Master Short reasoned that this approach was not satisfactory as &ldquo;viva voce evidence is always to be preferred&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Master Short dated August 25, 2018, Appeal Record and Compendium, Tab 7, p. 31, para. 33.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>56. This position is supported by Justice Murray in <CASEREF><SOC>Paiva v. Corpening</SOC></CASEREF>, who noted that it is a general principle in both civil and criminal cases that, if there is a trial, that evidence at trial should be presented orally in open court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Paiva v. Corpening</SOC><CITE>[2012] O.J. No. 771</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 14, p. 5, para. 23.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>57. It goes without saying that viva voce evidence carries more weight than written records and a witness being in a box, subject to cross-examination and credibility determination is more persuasive to a trial judge that documentary evidence.

<P>58. The only evidence offered by the Appellants in opposition to the Respondent's request for bifurcation was the inconvenience to the Plaintiffs of having to attend at trial twice, a reason which Master Short correctly rejected, at paragraph 36, as insufficient to trump the early consideration of the liability issues.

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Issue"><N>3:</N><TI>Application of Rule 6.1.01 to Non-Jury Trials</TI>
<P>59. The Appellants suggest that with the deliberate inclusion of the condition, &ldquo;with the consent of the parties&rdquo; in Rule 6.1.01, the Civil Rules Committee intended consent as a requirement and limitation on the Court's jurisdiction with respect to bifurcation of <UNDER>all</UNDER> trials&mdash;jury and non-jury.</P>
<P>60. Although the exact recommendation from Justice Osborne's report was not adopted by the Civil Justice Committee, a rule addressing bifurcation was ultimately included in the comprehensive 2010 amendments to the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, in which access to justice, affordability and proportionality were the overarching themes.
<P1><BOLD>Rule 6.1.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, O.Reg. 438/08.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>61. It was never the intention of the Civil Rules Committee to obfuscate the clear and ongoing common law right to bifurcation of a non-jury trial. As noted by Justice MacLeod in <EM>Campbell</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>In the first place, Bondy-Rafael was rendered by a split court with a powerful dissent concurring in the result and it dealt with Rule 6.1 of the Rules. It is a decision that is intentionally restrictive in its application and it does not apply to the case at bar. Insofar as the case stands for the proposition that Rule 6.1 of the Rules of Civil Procedure excludes any inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate an action, for purposes of this motion I do not have to decide whether that conclusion is binding upon me in similar circumstances. I would observe in passing that I prefer the analysis of Corbett J. to that of the majority. Justice Corbett's analysis of the rule is not only consistent with current judicial trends but with the rationale for enacting the rule. <BOLD>As it happens I was a participant in all of the deliberations of the Rules Committee considering the recommendations of the Osborne Report. I am certain that it was never the intent of the Rules Committee to &ldquo;occupy the field&rdquo; or to restrict the inherent jurisdiction of the court. [emphasis added]</BOLD></P></QUOTE>

<P>62. Justice Wilson's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 took into account the fact that Rule 6.1.1 was intended to improve accessibility and affordability to the justice system and ensure that the time and expense spent on a proceeding is proportionate to the amount in dispute or the importance of the issues at stake.</P>
<P>63. The Appellants' characterization of Rule 6.1.01 as completely eliminating the court's inherent discretion to order bifurcation in non-jury trials contradicts the purpose behind the CJRP that enacted the rule.</P>
<P>64. The Appellants contend that Justice Wilson erred in concluding that Rule 6.1.01 did not oust the court's inherent jurisdiction to order bifurcation unless the parties, as a pre condition, consent to separate hearings, and that consent is a precondition before bifurcation can be allowed; however, this argument ignores the principles of accessibility, affordability and proportionality which underlie the intent of the legislature in enacting the 2010 amendments including Rule 6.1.01.</P>
<P>65. Moreover, by imposing the Appellants' literal interpretation of Rule 6.1.01, not only is it inconsistent with the legislature's intention and object behind Rule 6.1.01 but it is also inconsistent with Rule 1.04 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</P>
<P>66. At paragraph 68 of Justice Wilson's Reasons for Decision, she stated:
<QUOTE><P>Alternatively, if I am wrong in my conclusion that the Master was not bound by the <EM>obiter</EM> analysis in in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM>, then I conclude relying on <EM>Carter</EM>, that the principles outlined in <EM>Hymiak</EM> trump the decision of the Divisional Court. The Master's order should be upheld. The parameters of the debate and guiding principles in the conduct of civil litigation dramatically shifted with <EM>Hymiak</EM> and should be applied.</P>
<P>Bifurcation in this case is efficient, and will promote settlement. Bifurcation of the liability and damages issues is in the interests of justice for the parties, consistent with the overarching purpose enunciated in Rule 1.04. This Rule provides that the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> are to &ldquo;be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.</P></QUOTE>

<P>70. A legal pronouncement that is integral to the result or the analysis underlying the determination of the matter in any particular case will be binding. In some cases, the legal pronouncement may only be a narrow point in a specific factual context while in others, the court may set out legal analyses that have application beyond the facts of the particular case. Examples of the latter include the vast majority of Supreme Court of Canada decisions that set out the legal framework for novel issues.

It is clear that Justice Wilson had considered and applied the legal principles cited above in arriving at her conclusion that the discussion in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> respecting the application of Rule 6.1.01 to non-jury cases is non-binding obiter dictum and in this regard, she was not bound by it.
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Justice Wilson, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 3, p. 15&ndash;17, paras. 47&ndash;53.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>73. In <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM>, the motion judge granted the defendants request to bifurcate the jury trial without the plaintiffs consent such that trial for determination of liability would proceed before the assessment of damages. On appeal, the Court stated that &ldquo;the central issue is whether the motion judge had any power to order bifurcation without the consent of all parties.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 3, p. 2, para. 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>74. The facts in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> included:
<P1>a) Two minor Plaintiffs were involved in a motor vehicle accident wherein they sustained catastrophic injuries;</P1>
<P1>b) The minor Plaintiffs, their mother and brother commenced a claim against the driver of the vehicle that struck them as well as the municipality;</P1>
<P1>c) A jury notice was filed;</P1>
<P1>d) The trial was scheduled for eight weeks to commence in Windsor on September 8, 2014;</P1>
<P1>e) A few months prior to the trial date, the defendants learned of a material change in circumstances relevant to damages and, in particular, future care costs; and</P1>
<P1>f) The defendants also proposed using the September 8 trial date to deal only with the issue of liability and sought an order bifurcating the trial, so that the damages assessment would proceed subsequent to the determination of liability.
<P2><BOLD>Ibid.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>75. Ultimately, the motion judge as well as this Court in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> held that a jury trial could not be bifurcated without the consent of all parties as dictated by Rule 6.1.01.
<P1><BOLD>Ibid.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>76. The discussion in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> respecting the application of Rule 6.1.01 to non-jury cases was not integral to the result or the analysis underlying the determination of the issue before the court in that case, which was whether a motion judge can order the bifurcation of a jury trial without the consent of the parties.</P>
<P>77. Further, the underlying theme of the CJRP and which carried over into the post-Rule 6.1.1 cases, was the expansion of the court's ability to order bifurcation of jury trials upon consent of parties (whereas, previously the common law excluded such as an order even with consent). T he aim of the Rule was not, as the Appellants contend, to disrupt the common law inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate non-jury trials.</P>
<P>78. The Respondent concurs with Justice Wilson's conclusion at paragraph 65 of her decision that the ratio decidendi of <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> should be read as applying solely to jury trials.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Shift in Culture</UNDER></TI>
<P>84. Justice Wilson cited the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada</SOC></CASEREF> for the principle that &ldquo;stare decisis is not a straightjacket that condemns the law to stasis. Trial courts may reconsider settled rulings of higher courts where a legal issue is raised or where there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD>Reasons for Decision of Justice Wilson, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 3, p. 18, paras. 60&ndash;62.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 5</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 22, para 44.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>82. The facts and circumstances of this case differ fundamentally from <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> such that Justice Wilson correctly heeded the Supreme Court of Canada's direction in <EM>Carter</EM> that &ldquo;changes in circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters&rdquo; of whether a previous decision of a higher court ought to be restrictively adhered to.</P>
<P>85. It is submitted that Justice Wilson's characterization of the case law surrounding Rule 20 as bringing about a shift in culture towards more expeditious trial and pre-trial procedures, as detailed above, is widely accepted whereas the Appellants' characterization of the Rule 20 jurisprudence as simply case law interpreting a rule change is reflective of an unduly impoverished and narrow vision of the sea change advocated by <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, <BOLD>Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>86. It is therefore submitted that this Honourable Court is not bound by its decision in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM>.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART V&mdash;ORDER REQUESTED</TI>
<P>87. The Respondent respectfully requests that the within appeal of Justice Wilson's decision be denied with costs payable to the Respondent.</P>

<P>The Plaintiffs, moving party on appeal, will make a motion to the Divisional Court of Ontario, at Osgoode Hall, 130 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario for the motion to be heard on a date fixed by the Registrar.</P>
<P>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING: The motion is to be heard orally.</P>
<P>THIS MOTION IS FOR:
<P1>a) Leave to Appeal of the decision of the Honourable Justice J. Wilson, at Toronto, dated April 4, 2018;</P1>
<P1>b) The costs of this motion; and</P1>
<P1>c) Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:
<P1>a) The learned Appeal Judge erred in applying Rules 20 and 50.07 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> and concluding that the Master had jurisdiction to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages;</P1>
<P1>b) The learned Appeal Judge misapplied the purpose of rule 6.1.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure;</P1>
<P1>c) The learned Appeal Judge erred in applying section 138 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> in failing to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings;</P1>
<P1>d) The learned Appeal Judge erred in law in determining that this was not an appropriate case in which to apply Rule 36.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>;</P1>
<P1>e) The learned Appeal Judge erred in law in determining that bifurcation was the only way to secure the just, most expeditious, and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits, as stated in Rule 1.04(1);</P1>
<P1>f) The learned Appeal Judge erred in law in finding that the Defendant met the high burden of proof to justify bifurcation;</P1>
<P1>g) The learned Appeal Judge failed to adequately take into consideration the best interests of the minor Plaintiff, a person under disability, when considering the implications of her Order;</P1>
<P1>h) The learned Appeal Judge created distinctions between jury and non jury matters where no such distinction exists in the Rules of Civil Procedure;</P1>
<P1>i) The learned Appeal Judge misapprehended the applicability of <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> and misapplied <EM>Hyrniak</EM>;</P1>
<P1>j) There is a clear conflict between cases: <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I: OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This Leave to Appeal/appeal concerns the right of a plaintiff in Ontario to have all issues in dispute decided in one trial.</P>
<P>2. This action arises out of a tragic accident on September 12, 2010 in which the Plaintiff, [G. D.] then only four years old, opened a defective sliding balcony door in a rental unit owned by the Defendant. [G.] climbed up over a balcony railing, and fell 10-15 feet to the ground below. As a result of this fall, [G.] suffered an undisplaced skull fracture and a closed head injury. This head injury has developed into a number of psychological, behavioural and developmental issues. Due to [G.]'s age the full extent of the brain injury sequelae is unclear.</P>
<P>3. The Plaintiffs brought a motion for an extension of time to set the within action down for trial from March 21, 2017 to March 21, 2020. The Defendant brought a cross-motion seeking an order bifurcating the trial on the issues of liability and damages. Both parties opposed each other's motions, returnable May 8, 2017.</P>
<P>4. Master Short granted each parties' order in his reasons released August 25, 2017.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II: ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The Plaintiffs submit that the standard of review is that of correctness.</P>
<P>6. The Plaintiffs submit that Justice Wilson made the following errors:
<P1>(a) In her interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> to find that she had jurisdiction to bifurcate the trial without the consent of all parties;</P1>
<P1>(b) In the alternative, if this Honourable Court accepts Master Short's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01, the Plaintiffs submit that Master Short made the following errors in his application of Rule 6.1.01:
<P2>(i) In finding that there was sufficient evidence to determine whether bifurcation was appropriate; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) In finding that the Defendants had satisfied the high threshold to justify bifurcation in these circumstances.</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) In her determination she was not bound by the finding of the Divisional court in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al v Potrebic et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK2>

<P>7. There is no reasoned basis to distinguish between the decision of a master and that of a judge for the purposes of the standards of review on appeal. An appellate court cannot substitute its interpretation of the facts or reweigh the evidence simply because it takes a different view of the evidence from that of the master. On questions of law, the correctness standard applies.

<P>9. In <CASEREF><SOC>Elcano Acceptance Ltd. v Richmond, Richmond, Stambler and Mills</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal held that a judge's inherent jurisdiction to bifurcate a proceeding was a narrowly circumscribed power. This power is a departure from the basic right of litigants to have all issues in dispute decided in one trial and <EM>ought therefore to be exercised only in exceptional cases</EM>.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Elcano Acceptance Ltd. v Richmond, Richmond, Stambler and Mills</SOC><YEAR>1989</YEAR><CITE>55 OR (2d) 56</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab C.</P1></P>
<P>10. After <EM>Elcano</EM>, when the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> were amended in 2010, there were recommendations that bifurcation be available either on motion by the parties or on the Court's own initiative. That recommendation was <EM>not</EM> adopted.

<P>11. In 2010, the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> were amended. Rule 6.1.01 provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P><EM>With the consent of the parties</EM>, the court may order a separate hearing on one or more issues in a proceeding, including separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, RRO 1990, Reg 194 rule 6.1.01 [emphasis added].</P1></P>
<P>12. Provisions in an act are to be interpreted &ldquo;in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v Rex</SOC><CITE>[2002] 2 SCR 559</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab E.</P1></P>
<P>13. The Plaintiffs submit that the language of Rule 6.1.01 is clear. By the deliberate inclusion of the condition <EM>with the consent of the parties</EM>, the legislature intended this as a requirement and limitation of the Court's jurisdiction.</P>
<P>14. Since Rule 6.1.01 came into effect, there has been divided authority on whether a court has jurisdiction to bifurcate a non-jury trial on the issues of liability and damages absent consent of the parties.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>City of Hamilton v Attorney General et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 1043</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab F.</P1></P>
<P>15. The most significant decision that found the Court has jurisdiction is <CASEREF><SOC>Soulliere (Litigation guardian of) v Robitaille Estate</SOC></CASEREF>. Justice Smith held that the wording of Rule 6.1.01 did not remove the inherent jurisdiction of the court to bifurcate a trial, but he declined to do so because the plaintiff was ready for trial and to do so would have caused substantial delay.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Soulliere v Robitaille Estate</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 5073</CITE><PARANUM>27&ndash;31</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab G.</P1></P>
<P>16. However, more recent decisions from the Superior Court found that the Court does not have jurisdiction to bifurcate the trial in the absence of consent. In 2015, Justice Molloy reviewed the case law from the Ontario Superior Court and found that all but one judge found no power to order bifurcation in the face of an objection by one of the parties.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al. v Potrebic, et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE><PARANUM>25&ndash;27</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab H.</P1></P>
<P>17. This was in keeping with the principles set out in the only recent Ontario Court of Appeal decision that considered bifurcation, <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach (Litigation Guardian of) v Kovach</SOC></CASEREF>, although it dealt with pre-2010 <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. The Court of Appeal stated,
<QUOTE><P>The practice in Ontario has long been understood to preclude the bifurcation of trials where a jury notice has been served, in the absence of consent. To reverse that practice, as the appellants seek, would be a major change in the law.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach (Litigation Guardian of) v Kovach</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 126</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab D.</P1></P>
<P>18. Subsequently, on appeal from a motion judge's decision, Justice Molloy of the Divisional Court offered the following guidance,
<QUOTE><P>On a plain reading of Rule 6.1.01, <EM>a motion judge has a discretion to order bifurcation, but only if all parties consent</EM>. Even with the consent of the parties, the court is not required to order bifurcation, but without consent he or she has no power to do so. In other words, <EM>the consent of the parties is a pre-condition to the exercise of the discretion</EM>.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>The case law is clear that the inherent jurisdiction of the court can be removed by the legislature by &ldquo;clear and precise language indicating the contrary,&rdquo; The court's inherent jurisdiction and its power conferred by statute can live side by side, but the inherent jurisdiction can never be exercised in a manner that would contravene a statutory provision.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>There is clear authority from the Ontario Court of Appeal that if a Rule of Civil Procedure can be said to &ldquo;occupy the field&rdquo; to which it relates, it will supersede any inherent jurisdiction to the contrary.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>It seems to me that the Court was of the view that the new Rule would take precedence over previous custom with respect to a judge's inherent jurisdiction, and that the clear intent of the Rule was to require consent before any trial could be bifurcated, whether jury or judge alone. The Rule itself makes no distinction between a jury trial and a non-jury trial. <EM>If the effect of the new Rule is that there can be bifurcation of a jury trial, but only on consent of all parties, that effect must apply equally to all trials, whether jury or non-jury</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al. v Potrebic, et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE><PARANUM>13, 16, 18 and 25</PARANUM></CASEREF> [emphasis added], BOA Tab H.</P1></P>
<P>19. Conversely, if the legislature had intended to create a permissive provision, wherein the consent of the parties was not required, the conditional provision would not have been included.</P>
<P>20. Section 138 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> specifically mandates the overarching principle that &ldquo;as far as possible, a multiplicity of proceedings shall be avoided&rdquo;.

<BLOCK4><N><UNDER>(ii)</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>No overriding provisions or reasons to forego consent requirement</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. In parallel circumstances, where the Court of Appeal had ordered monthly payments, changing the trial judge's award of a lump sum, the Supreme Court of Canada considered whether, in the absence of enabling legislation or the consent of all parties, a court can or should order that a plaintiff forego his traditional right to a lump-sum judgment for a series of periodic payments. The Supreme Court of Canada found that it would be inappropriate for the court to make this order.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Watkins v Olafson</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 SCR 750</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 764</PAGENUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab K.</P1></P>
<P>22. In doing so, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the judiciary is bound to apply the rules of law found in the legislation and in the precedents. In stating the limitations of the court in changing the law, the Supreme Court of Canada provided the following guidance.
<QUOTE><P>The court may not be in the best position to assess the deficiencies of the existing law, much less problems which may be associated with the changes it might make. The court has before it a single case; major changes in the law should be predicated on a wider view of how the rule will operate in the broad generality of cases. Moreover, the court may not be in a position to appreciate fully the economic and policy issues underlying the choice it is asked to make.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Considerations such as these suggest that major revisions of the law are best left to the legislature. Where the matter is one of a small extension of existing rules to meet the exigencies of a new case and the consequences of the change are readily assessable, judges can and should vary existing principles. <EM>But where the revision is major and its ramifications complex, the court must proceed with great caution</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Watkins v Olafson</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 SCR 750</CITE></CASEREF> [emphasis added] at pps. 760-761, BOA Tab K.</P1></P>
<P>23. Changes to rules of court procedure are more easily made than changes to the substantive law, since court procedures fall directly within the domain and expertise of the courts, which are in a good position to know what changes are required to make the court system fairer and what the consequences of the changes will be.

<P>24. Rule 6.1.01 is on its face a procedural provision. The Plaintiffs' right to have their case heard in one hearing is a crucial right of a plaintiff in our court system. By and large, hearing all the evidence and facts of a claim altogether is presumptively the most fair, efficient and least expensive option. Only in exceptional circumstances can and should the Court justify bifurcating the hearing.</P>
<P>25. Justice Wilson found that this was such a circumstance. The Plaintiffs submit that the evidence Justice Wilson relied upon in making her determination was inadequate.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><UNDER>C.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Was Justice Wilson Bound under the Principle of Stare Decisis</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. One of the fundamental principles of our legal system is that prior decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts of the same jurisdiction. The rule provides certainty and allows the orderly development of the law in incremental steps.</P>
<P>27. Justice Wilson at pars 51 to par 63 of her decision states that the Carter decision applies to this situation. Her Honour is relying on par 61 of the Carter decision which references that &ldquo;(1) where a new legal issue is raised; and (2) where there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate&rdquo; a court may not be bound by the doctrine of stare decisis.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015, SCC 5</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2015] 1 SCR 331</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at par 44. Tab R</P1></P>
<P>28. In Carter the Supreme Court of Canada was dealing with, among other issues how s.7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was impacted by the criminal code provisions dealing with assisted suicide. The seminal decision had been <CASEREF><SOC>Rodriquez v British Columbia (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[1993] 3 S.C.R. 519</CITE></CASEREF>. The Carter case was argued in 2015. The Court found it was reasonable for the trial judge to take into account the evolution of the law surrounding s. 7 of the Charter particularly in regard to principle of overbreadth.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Carter v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2015, SCC 5</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2015] 1 SCR 331</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at par 46 Tab R</P1></P>
<P>29. That is not the case here. The Divisional Court decision in Bondy-Raphael dealt with the applicability of R.6.1.01. There was no intervening change in the Rule or approach to the interpretation of R6.1.01. Justice Wilson's reliance on the Carter decision was respectfully misplaced.</P>
<P>30. Justice Wilson determined at par 38 of her reasons that Master Short was &ldquo;bound by the rules of stare decisis to follow the &ldquo;ratio decidendi&rdquo; when a higher court has decided the same or substantially the same issue. Justice Wilson then took a very narrow view of what constitutes the &ldquo;ratio decidendi&rdquo; of the decision in the Bondy-Rafael case.</P>
<P>31. Justice Wilson indicates that in the <CASEREF><SOC>Bedford v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA 186</CITE><PARANUM>57</PARANUM></CASEREF> the Ontario court of Appeal adopted the definition of stare decisis found in Halsbury's Laws of Canada. In fact the court while recognizing the Halsbury definition stated &ldquo;the traditional division between ratio and obiter has become more nuanced. It is now recognized that there is a spectrum of authoritativeness on which the statements of an appellate court may be placed&rdquo;.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bedford v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA</CITE><PARANUM>58</PARANUM></CASEREF> Tab S</P1></P>
<P>32. The court in Bedford indicated that the question to be asked in deciding what constitutes binding obiter and non binding obiter was &ldquo;what did the case decide&rdquo;?
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bedford v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2012 ONCA</CITE><PARANUM>59</PARANUM></CASEREF> Tab S</P1></P>
<P>33. In Bondy-Rafael the court stated the central issue &ldquo;is whether the motion judge had any power to order bifurcation with out the consent of all parties&rdquo;? Bondy-Rafael was dealing with the applicability of the new R6.1.01 and the effect it had on previous cases and custom. In doing so the majority determined it was the clear intent of the Rule to require consent of the parties before any trial could be bi-furcated. The Rule makes no distinction between jury or non jury trials.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael, et al. v Potrebic, et al.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF> BOA Tab H</P1></P>
<P>34. The consideration of the right to bifurcate both jury and non jury cases was a central to the ratio decedendi of the applicability of R6.1.01.</P>
<P>35. In referencing that Carter v Canada (Attorney General) has been applied in the civil context Her Honour notes the OCA decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Black v Owen</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 397</CITE></CASEREF>. This case involved a question of a trust to pay maintenance costs and taxes. On appeal from Justice Wilson's decision the OCA held the Appeal Judge erred in law by failing t follow the majority opinion in Amberwood and she was not entitled to adopt the minority opinion as reflecting current Ontario law.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Black v Owen</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 397</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF> Tab T</P1></P>
<P>36. In <CASEREF><SOC>Black v Owen</SOC></CASEREF> the court appears to caution against the ready applicability of the Carter line of cases. In discussing these cases the court stated &ldquo;First, unlike Bedford and Carter this is not a case involving s.7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Second, no new legal issue concerning the positive covenants rule or the possible exceptions to that rule, that were not addressed in Amberwood, was raised in this case. Third, no significant post Amberwood developments in the law of Ontario had occurred.

<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>In the Alternative Justice Wilson's Application of R6.1.01 was incorrect</TI>
<P>37. If this Honourable Court upholds Justice Wilson's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 and finds that she did have jurisdiction to order bifurcation, the Plaintiffs submit that these were not appropriate circumstances to do so because of the inadequate evidence and high threshold for ordering bifurcation.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><UNDER>(i)</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Inadequate evidence to find that bifurcation was appropriate</UNDER></TI>
<P>38. Justice Wilson states at paragraph 18 of her decision that no challenge was made before the Master as to the adequacy of the evidence. This is simply wrong. The admissibility of the evidence was not challenged but a good deal of argument in front of Master Short did deal with the adequacy of the evidence.</P>
<P>39. In obiter comments in <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach (Litigation Guardian of) v Kovach</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal noted that, practically speaking, it would be impossible for a judge at the motion stage to accurately predict whether or not there would be overlapping evidence in relation to the issues of both liability and damages.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Kovach (Litigation Guardian of) v Kovach</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 126</CITE><PARANUM>38</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab D.</P1></P>
<P>40. This is clearly one of the reasons that Rule 6.1.01 requires the parties' consent to bifurcate the hearing. The parties are in the best position to assess the evidence and determine what is best for their case.</P>
<P>41. Even at first instance Master Short acknowledged these limitations of a motions judge in his reasons at paragraph 41. However, he continued to make findings regarding the potential evidence and arguments of counsel, projecting years into the future. At paragraph 59 of his reasons, Master Short stated:
<QUOTE><P>In my assessment, the witnesses in the two portions of the proceeding are almost entirely different. The issue of damages will require a complex and lengthy trial that can <EM>easily be severed from the issue of liability</EM>, and as a consequence, the parties will all benefit from the potential savings of time and cost entailed in trying the liability issue first [emphasis added].</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>42. Not only was Master Short unable to sufficiently grasp the evidence and issues of the action in order to make this decision at this stage of the action as a result of his role at that time in the proceedings, but he also made this decision based on inadequate evidence.</P>
<P>43. The <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> provide the following guidance with respect to affidavit evidence:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>4.06</N><SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>An affidavit shall be confined to the statement of facts within the personal knowledge of the deponent or to other evidence that the deponent could give if testifying as a witness in court, except where these rules provide otherwise.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC>

<P>44. Generally, an affidavit should not contain hearsay, except as allowed by Rule 39.01(4). In order to include hearsay, an affidavit must specify its source and the fact of the belief. An affidavit should contain facts explaining the role of the deponent in the proceeding and how he or she came to be in possession of information that is contained in the affidavit, so that a judge can assess the veracity of the information and distinguish a deponent's personal information from information received from others.

<P>45. Essentially, it must be possible to test an allegation through cross-examination. Otherwise, there is an incentive to swell the evidence freely with unsupported statements by persons not clearly identified and, therefore, safe from inquisition.

<P>46. Several affidavits were sworn by persons at the Defence counsel's office in support of their cross-motion. These affidavits purported to provide evidence as to the age and health of the proposed liability witnesses: Lorna Ritchie, a Property Manager of the Defendant, and the two superintendants at the time of the accident, John and Sandra Lublinkhof.</P>
<P>47. Tatiana Sanderson, a law clerk at Defence counsel's office, swore an affidavit on May 6, 2017 in support of the cross-motion. She advised the following at paragraphs 2&ndash;4.
<QUOTE><P>Ms. Ritchie testified on behalf of the Defendant in November 2015. At that time, she indicated that she was 59 years old. She is presently 61 years old.</P>
<P>Based on my review of my file, I can advise that John Lublinkhof, who retired from the Corporation in 2012, was born on [date omitted] He is currently 69 years old.</P>
<P>Based on my review of my file, I can advise that Sandra Lublinkhof was born on [date omitted] She is currently 68 years old.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><EM>Attached hereto and referred to as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a copy of the Affidavit of Tatiana Sanderson, sworn May 6, 2017</EM>.</P>
<P>48. There were no supporting documents enclosed or even referred to in Ms. Sanderson's affidavit.</P>
<P>49. David Boghosian, the managing partner at Defence counsel's office, also swore an Affidavit in support of the Defendant's cross motion on May 2, 2017. This affidavit included double hearsay and speculative statements at paragraphs 9,21 and 22:
<QUOTE><P>Lorna Ritchie testified on behalf of the Defendant. At her Examination, at which i was present, she testified that ... Mr. and Mrs. Lublinkhof are elderly. Despite our asking, Mr. Lublinkhof has declined to disclose any aspect of his current health circumstances.</P>
<P>I am advised by Ms. Ritchie and do verily believe that Mr. Lublinkhof is an elderly gentlemen <EM>who was in poor health when she last saw him</EM>. Given his age and the uncertainty of his health, it would be prejudicial to the Defendant if this action is not set down for trial and the liability portion of the action tried as soon as possible.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>Even if Mr. Lublinkhof's heath [<EM>sic</EM>] does not significantly impair his ability to testify at trial, <EM>it is very likely</EM> that his recollection of the events that transpired in 2010, including the interactions that he had with the Plaintiffs, will be <EM>substantially eroded by 2022</EM> or a year or even more, which is the earliest that the trial would likely be scheduled if the action was not set down until March 21, 2022.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P><EM>Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; is a copy of the Affidavit of David Boghosian, sworn May 2, 2017</EM> [emphasis added].

<P>50. Master Short and Justice Wilson relied on these affidavits to determine that the delay in hearing evidence from the elderly witnesses was not reasonable and the likely content of these witnesses' evidence, which was key to a finding that liability and damages could be heard separately.</P>
<P>51. At the motion in front of Master Short, the Plaintiffs did not seek to have this evidence struck. However, given the apparent shortcomings in the evidence and Master Short's own acknowledgement of his limitations at this stage of the proceedings in determining the evidence, it was inappropriate for Master Short and Justice Wilson to rely on this improper evidence.</P>
<P>52. The Plaintiffs submit that, at the very least, less weight should have been accorded by Justice Wilson to this improper evidence, particularly where such a high threshold to order bifurcation is clearly required.</P>
<P>53. In his reasons at paragraph 76, Master Short acknowledged that there has not been an inordinate or inexcusable delay caused by the Plaintiffs. Rather, the Plaintiffs have moved this matter forward appropriately. He found, however, and Justice Wilson accepted that the Defendant had established prejudice relating to the aging of the Defendants fact witnesses by relying on the improper affidavits sworn by Ms. Sanderson and Mr. Boghosian.</P>
<P>54. Pursuant to Rule 36.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, the evidence of a non-party witness may be taken in advance of trial. Master Short found that this would not be appropriate at this stage of the action, but offered no reasons for this finding. Examination under oath prior to the trial remains a possibility at this time.</P>
<P>55. The fact that an examination under oath pursuant to Rule 36.01 is even a possibility is because the Plaintiffs brought the action while [G.] is still a minor. [G.] was born on [date omitted] This accident occurred when he was four years old. Pursuant to section 6 of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM>, 2002, [G.]could have delayed filing the Statement of Claim until just prior to his [date omitted]: two years after his [date omitted]birthday.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <EM>Limitations Act, 2002</EM>, SO 2002, c. 24, Sched. B, section 6.</P1></P>
<P>56. In contemplating dismissals for delay pursuant to Rule 24.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, wide latitude has been permitted as long as the delay is not intentional and contumelious or there is such prejudice from the delay that there is a substantial risk a fair trial might not now be possible.
<P1><BOLD><EM>Ref:</EM></BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Woodheath Developments Ltd. v Goldman</SOC><CITE>[2001] 56 OR (3d) 658</CITE><PARANUM>15 and 29</PARANUM></CASEREF>, BOA Tab Q.</P1></P>
<P>57. In his reasons at paragraphs 76 and 77, Master Short acknowledged that,
<QUOTE><P>The Defendant has not proffered any evidence to suggest the Plaintiffs have caused any undue delay, such that there is no presumption of any prejudice whatsoever to the Defendant.</P>
<P>The only prejudice established relates to the aging of the Defendants fact witnesses which is being addressed by my granting of bifurcation.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>58. These comments clearly indicate Master Short's reliance on the Defendant's evidence regarding the age and health of the Lublinkhofs. The Plaintiffs submit that Master Short failed to provide satisfactory reasons for relying on the Defendant's evidence to find prejudice and for finding that Rule 36.01 was not appropriate at this stage of the action. This was evidence that should not have been relied on by Justice Wilson.</P>
<P>59. The defendant's evidence is that the parties have gathered all the necessary evidence required to deal with the issues of liability. In Mr. Boghosian's Affidavit he swears that:
<ITEM><P>the parties have gathered all the necessary evidence required to deal with the issues of liability including</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>a complete unredacted file of Durham Regional Police Service</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>the Corporation of the Township of Uxbridge records relating to a property standards investigation</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corporation inspection and repair records pertaining to the Unit; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>the Lease Agreement between the Defendant and Jessica Knight</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> Affidavit of David Boghosian sworn May 2, 2017</P1></P>
<P>60. In his Affidavit Mr. Boghosian further swears the defendants have two expert witnesses. Lay witnesses will be Mr. John Lublinkhof and Ms. Sandra Lublinkhof who were the superintendents of the building. Mr. Boghosian's Affidavit indicates that Mr. Lublinkhof carried out various repairs and maintenance to the building. There is no evidence as to Sandra Lublinkhof's necessity as a witness.
<P1><BOLD>Ref:</BOLD> Affidavit of David Boghosian sworn May 2, 2017 at par 20</P1></P>
<P>61. If Mr. Lublinkhof is called to give evidence about maintenance and repairs he will be reliant on the documentary evidence which by the defendants admission has been assembled.</P>
<P>62. If there is such prejudice, which the Plaintiffs deny, then examination under oath prior to the trial under Rule 36.01 satisfies each parties' evidential rights without infringing on any rights. Here, bifurcation infringes on the Plaintiffs' right to one hearing of all the issues. In balancing these two options, the Plaintiffs submit that Rule 36.01 satisfies the requirements of Rule 1.04(1) for the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><UNDER>(ii)</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>High threshold to justify bifurcation was not met in these circumstances</UNDER></TI>
<P>63. According to Master Short's reasons at paragraph 68, bifurcation can only be ordered in &ldquo;exceptional cases&rdquo;. The evidence filed by the moving party in support of bifurcation must be extraordinary, particularly where the other party objects as set out at paragraphs 72&ndash;74 of his reasons.</P>
<P>64. Where the evidence is of little probative value, the Plaintiffs submit this high threshold cannot be considered satisfied. Given the shortcomings of the evidence relied upon and identified above, the Plaintiffs submit that the evidence filed falls far short of &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;.</P>
<P>65. Master Short stated at paragraph 71 of his reasons,
<QUOTE><P>I believe there is a reasonable chance that the result of a separate trial on liability will put an end to the action or facilitate the resolution of the damages claims.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. More than a &ldquo;reasonable chance&rdquo; is required to justify an opposed order for bifurcation.</P>
<P>67. Justice Wilson in relying on Master Short's reasons erred in finding that the Defendant's evidence satisfied the high threshold to order bifurcation, particularly where the Plaintiffs did not consent.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>PART IV: CONCLUSION</UNDER></TI>
<P>68. The Plaintiffs submit that these are appropriate circumstances to reverse Master Short's order bifurcating the liability and damages of this action on the basis that Master Short made an error in his interpretation of Rule 6.1.01 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> and he did not have jurisdiction to make this order.</P>
<P>69. In the alternative, the Plaintiffs submit that, if this Honourable Court accepts Master Short's interpretation of Rule 6.1.01, Master Short erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence to determine whether bifurcation was appropriate and in finding that the Defendant satisfied the high threshold to justify bifurcation.</P>
<P>70. The Plaintiffs also request costs of this motion on a partial indemnity basis fixed and payable by the Defendant.</P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED THIS 11th day of May, 2018</P>

<BLOCK0><TI>FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The Appellants seek leave to appeal the decision of Justice Wilson dated April 4, 2018 wherein she upheld the decision of Master Short released on August 25, 2017. Master Short granted, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the Respondent's motion to bifurcate the trial on the issues of liability and damages.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW STATEMENT</TI>
<P>2. On May 8, 2017, Master Short heard two motions brought by the parties&mdash;the Appellants' to extend the time to set the within action down for trial to March 31, 2020 and the Respondent's motion to bifurcate of the trial on the issues of liability and damages.</P>
<P>3. Master Short granted both motions and ordered that the severed liability portion of the action would have to be set down by June 30, 2018; failing which, that aspect of his order would lapse.</P>
<P>4. The Appellants appealed Master Short order granting bifurcation. That appeal was heard by Justice Wilson on February 26, 2018. Justice Wilson dismissed the appeal finding that Rule 6.1.01 did not displace the court's common law inherent discretion to order bifurcation of non-jury trials. Further, she found that the obiter analysis of this court in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF> was not binding as the issues in that case dealt with the request for bifurcation, without the consent of the parties, of a jury trial.</P>
<P>5. Both Master Short and Justice Wilson correctly interpreted the jurisprudence on Rule 6.1.01, which came into effect after the 2010 amendments to the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. Rule 6.1.01 was not intended to eliminate the long standing common law jurisdiction of the court to order bifurcation of judge-alone trials. The Rule change was only intended to affect jury trials.</P>
<P>6. The Appellants have failed to establish why leave to appeal Justice Wilson's order should be granted.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<P>7. This action arises from injuries sustained by the Plaintiff/Appellant, [G. D.], a minor, who fell from the rear second floor balcony of his mother's residence at [location omitted] [location omitted](hereinafter, the &ldquo;Unit&rdquo;) on September 12, 2010 when he was four years old. At the time of the fall, [G.] was unsupervised.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 44, para. 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. While [G.]'s mother, Jessica Knight was attending to a visitor, [G.] climbed onto a chair on the balcony, climbed over the railing and fell 10&ndash;15 feet, striking the top of a barbeque unit and then the patio of the neighbouring unit.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 44, para. 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. At the material time, Ms. Knight leased the Unit from the Respondent.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 45, para. 4.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. It is alleged that the Respondent failed to install a functioning lock on the screen door to the balcony in the Unit and failed to keep the balcony, including its railing, safe for those using it.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 45, para. 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. The Examinations for Discovery took place on October 29, 2015 and February 22, 2016.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 45, para. 8.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. Lorna Ritchie testified on behalf of the Respondent. At her Examination, Ms. Ritchie testified that:
<ITEM><P>At the time of the fall, she was a Property Manager with the Respondent.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She managed [location omitted]in 2010 and had two superintendents, John and Sandra Lublinkhof.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Both Mr. and Mrs. Lublinkhof retired from the Corporation in 2012 and thereafter moved to Sudbury, Ontario (where they continue to reside). Mr. and Mrs. Lublinkhof are elderly. Mr. Lublinkhof has declined to disclose any aspect of his current health circumstances.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She has also since retired.</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 45, para. 9.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. Ms. Ritchie testified that she conducted the move-in inspection of the Unit with Jessica Knight in August 2008 and that the only deficiency advised by Ms. Knight at that time was a malfunctioning closet door in the master bedroom and bolts that required tightening on the balcony. A few weeks after that inspection, Mr. Lublinkhof changed the lag bolts on the balcony to appease Ms. Knight even though he did not find that they were in fact loose.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 45, para. 10.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. During the Discovery of the Appellant Jessica Knight, she stated that:
<ITEM><P>She moved into the Unit on August 1, 2008;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>She was present during the move-in inspection and she signed off on the acceptability of the Unit;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>In August 2008, she requested repairs to the balcony and sliding glass door in the Unit and John Lublinkhof undertook those repairs;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The Unit was inspected annually by the Respondent and she did not complain about the condition of the balcony or the sliding door, whether glass or screen, during the 2009 or 2010 inspections;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>[G.] frequently climbed on things like furniture before the fall, including, on an occasion a few weeks before the fall, when he pulled up a chair to the refrigerator and climbed on top of the refrigerator. In another incident, which happened approximately 18 months earlier, [G.] climbed on a chair onto the counter in the bathroom, stood on it, took out a Tylenol #3 bottle stored in the cabinet above the sink which was not properly closed and ingested some Tylenol #3;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>[G.] had a lack of safety awareness prior to the fall; ad</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>[G.] has no memory of the circumstances surrounding the fall (and, as such, will not need to testify at the liability portion of the trial).</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 46, para. 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. The parties have gathered all the necessary evidence required to deal with the issue of liability including the following records:
<P1>(a) Complete unredacted file of Durham Regional Police Services;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Corporation of the Township of Uxbridge records relating to a property standards investigation;</P1>
<P1>(c) Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corporation inspection and repair records pertaining to the Unit; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Lease Agreement between the Respondent and Jessica Knight.
<P2><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 47, para. 12.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<P>16. Expert reports on liability have already been exchanged. The Appellants have retained Walters Forensic, whose liability report was served on the Respondent on June 4, 2015, to opine on whether the state of repair of the sliding glass door and balcony met the requirements of the applicable laws and bylaws.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 47, para. 13 and 16.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. The Respondent retained Nancy Reynolds and Orr Brown Consulting Engineers to provide expert opinions with respect to liability.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 47, para. 13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Nancy Reynolds, an expert in child safety and a certified childproof professional, was retained to opine on whether the locks on both the screen and sliding glass doors were adequate child proofing.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 47, para. 14.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. Ms. Reynold opined that:
<QUOTE><P>It is not reasonable to think that latching mechanisms which come in the screen and glass sliding doors are &ldquo;childproofed.&rdquo; It should never be considered that a child at the age of 4 is not able to open any latch that an adult can open. It is up to parents or caregivers to know that children are not able to understand what is hazardous to their safety. They need to take into account that children's lack of prior experience and therefore curiosity to learn what things do, lead them into experiment with everything around them. To keep children safe, parents need to physically take away the hazard. When this is not possible, then they need to take additional measures to make it difficult for a child have the opportunity access the danger as well as supervise them. While it is not humanly possible to supervise at all times, parents should not rely on a product to stop a child from getting hurt. It is important that parents and caregivers understand that products can assist in deterring children but we cannot predict when a child can defeat a device.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 47, para. 15.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Orr Brown Consulting Engineers Ltd. (&ldquo;Orr Brown&rdquo;) was retained to opine on building code requirements of exterior sliding screen doors and to comment on the report of Walters Forensic Engineering Report dated June 2, 2015.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 48, para. 17.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>24. Orr Brown's report is authored by Alison Orr, a former municipal building inspector, property standards inspector and building code consultant. In Ms. Orr's opinion:
<ITEM><P>The <EM>Ontario Building Code</EM> in effect at the time of the construction of the building, and even the Building Code in effect for new construction today, does not require any locking mechanism on an exterior sliding screen door;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The <EM>Ontario Building Code</EM> does not regulate placement of furniture or objects on a balcony that could facilitate climbing;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The lock on the glass patio door would meet the requirements of the Property Standards by-law, which required all exterior doors to have suitable hardware so as to allow locking or otherwise securing from inside the dwelling unit. The purpose of the lock is to prevent unauthorized entry into the dwelling unit. It is not intended to prevent access of a person onto a balcony; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Regarding the condition of the guard, it is notable that requests for repairs were made on September 16, 2009, November 19, 2009, May 3, 2010, and June 3, 2010, and no issues with the balcony guard were raised. A request for repairs was made August 20, 2008, and new lag bolts, washers and nuts were noted to be installed on September 4, 2008. The notch in the top rail would prevent the guard from moving outward.</P></ITEM>
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 48, para. 17.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. The Respondent's two key liability witnesses are John and Sandra Lublinkhof, the former superintendents with the Respondent at the time of [G.]'s fall. Mr. Lublinkhof earned out various repairs to the Unit prior to and after [G.]'s fall. His evidence will be central to the determination of liability in this action. The Lublinkhofs currently reside in Sudbury.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 49, paras. 20-21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. Mr. Lublinkhof is an elderly gentleman who is in poor health. Given his age and the uncertainty of his health, it would be prejudicial to the Respondent if the liability portion of the action is not tried as soon as possible.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 49, para. 21.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>27. Moreover, it is common knowledge that memory fades over time. It has already been over 7.5 years since [G]'s fall in September 2010. Even if Mr. Lublinkhof's health does not significantly impair his ability to testify at trial, it is very likely that his recollection of the events that transpired in 2010, including the interactions that he had with the Appellants, will be substantially eroded by 2022 or a year or even more, which is the earliest that the trial would likely be scheduled if the action was not set down until March 31, 2020.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 49, para. 22.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. The Respondent presently intends to call three lay witnesses (John Lublinkhof, Sandra Lublinkhof and Lorna Ritchie) and two experts witnesses (Nancy Reynolds and Alison Orr) at trial dealing with the issue of liability.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 50, para. 25.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>29. It would be highly prejudicial to the Respondent for the trial judge to receive evidence that may be tainted by severely faded memories which is likely to occur if the parties are forced to wait until 2020 for the action to be set down and an additional 1-2 years before it is actually tried.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 50, para. 28.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>30. A substantial amount of the trial time will be expended on proving damages. Bifurcation of the trial with a trial of liability now and a trial on damages at a later time when the long term effects of his injuries are better known, <EM>if necessary</EM>, will result in a significant savings of time and costs to all the parties and would best serve the overall interests of justice.
<P1><BOLD>Affidavit of David G. Boghosian, Appeal Record of the Plaintiff, Tab 4, page 50, para. 23.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>31. In contrast, it is expected that the Appellants will call medical, rehabilitation specialists and educational witnesses at trial to testify on the issue of damages, particularly how the brain injury which [G.] allegedly sustained as a result of the fall, has and will continue to, impact his life into adulthood, which the Respondent will be required to respond to.

<P>32. The issues of liability and damages require separate hearings. Further, a determination of liability would significantly enhance the settlement prospects of the action.

<P>33. The Respondent submits that the following issues are to be determined on this motion for leave to appeal:
<P1>(a) Have the Appellants met the test for obtaining leave to appeal Justice Wilson's decision?</P1></P>
<P>34. Rule 62.02 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> provides that:
<QUOTE><P>(4) Leave to appeal shall not be granted unless,
<P1>(a) there is a conflicting decision by another judge or court in Ontario or elsewhere on the matter involved in the proposed appeal and it is, in the opinion of the panel hearing the motion, desirable that leave to appeal be granted; or</P1>
<P1>(b) there appears to the panel hearing the motion good reason to doubt the correctness of the order in question and the proposed appeal involves matters of such importance that, in the panel's opinion, leave to appeal should be granted.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> RRO 1990, Reg 194, r. 62.02(4), Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>35. The wording of Rule 62.02(4)(a) and (b) makes it clear that the legislature's intent was to discourage appeals from an interlocutory order of a judge except in extraordinary circumstances. Leave to appeal from an interlocutory order of a judge is onerous and leave should not be granted where the decision is well-reasoned and the issues raised are not of general importance.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The First Test</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>There are no conflicting decisions</TI>
<P>36. The onus is on the Appellants to establish that there is a conflicting decision of another judge or court in Ontario or elsewhere (but not a lower level court) and that it is, in the opinion of the judge hearing this motion, &ldquo;desirable that leave to appeal be granted.&rdquo; A &ldquo;conflicting decision&rdquo; must be with respect to a matter of principle, not merely a situation in which a different result was reached in respect of a particular fact.

<P>37. The Respondent is not aware of any decision of this Honourable Court where the issue of bifurcation of a judge-along trial, without consent of all the parties, was denied.</P>
<P>38. Much of the Appellants' factum is devoted to the general merits of the case and on this Court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebric</SOC></CASEREF>, a case in which the factual matrix was different from the case at bar and where the issue to be decided was the bifurcation of a jury trial.</P>
<P>39. The facts in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> included:
<P1>(a) Two minor Plaintiffs were involved in a motor vehicle accident wherein they sustained catastrophic injuries;</P1>
<P1>(b) The minor Plaintiffs, their mother and brother commenced a claim against the driver of the vehicle that struck them as well as the municipality;</P1>
<P1>(c) A jury notice was filed;</P1>
<P1>(d) The trial was scheduled for eight weeks to commence in Windsor on September 8, 2014;</P1>
<P1>(e) A few months prior to the trial date, the defendants learned of a material change in circumstances relevant to damages and, in particular, future care costs; and</P1>
<P1>(f) The Defendants brought a motion seeking further discovery and medical assessments, which relief was granted by the motion judge. At the same time, they also proposed using the September 8 trial date to deal only with the issue of liability and sought an order bifurcating the trial, so that the damages assessment would proceed subsequent to the determination of liability.</P1></P>
<P>40. The motions judge in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> granted the defendants request to bifurcate the jury trial without the plaintiff's consent. On appeal, this Honourable Court found that in the face of Rule 6.1.01, bifurcation of a jury trial without the consent of the parties was prohibited.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3655</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 5 at para. 3.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>41. This court's discussion in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> respecting the application of Rule 6.1.01 to judge-alone cases was not integral to the result or the analysis underlying the determination of the issue before the court in that case, which is whether a motion judge can order the bifurcation of a jury trial without the consent of the parties.</P>
<P>42. The facts and circumstances of this case differ fundamentally from <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> such that Justice Wilson correctly heeded the Supreme Court of Canada's direction in <EM>Carter</EM> that &ldquo;changes in circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters&rdquo; of whether a previous decision of a higher court ought to be restrictively adhered to.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>It is not desirable for leave to be granted</TI>
<P>43. It is not enough for a moving party to demonstrate that two lower courts have exercised their discretion to produce different results. It is necessary to demonstrate a difference in the principles chosen as a guide to the exercise of such discretion.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Comtrade v. 490300 Ontario Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1992] O.J. No. 652</CITE></CASEREF><BOLD>, Respondent's Book of Authorities, Tab 4 at para 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>44. This motion was first heard before Master Short and then appealed by the Moving Parties and heard by Justice Wilson. The Appellants now seek leave to appeal the decision to Divisional Court after two previous hearings on the issue.</P>
<P>45. It is not desirable to have the same principles applied for a third time in this case by the Divisional Court when these principles have previously been developed, considered and applied by the courts and were correctly applied by Justice Wilson and Master Short in their decisions arising from the appeal and the original hearing of the motion.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Second Test</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision</TI>
<P>46. The test under the Rule 62.02(4)(b) is cumulative, the Appellants must satisfy this Honourable Court that there is good reason to doubt the correctness of Justice Wilson's Order and also that there are matters involving general public importance relevant to the development of the law and the administration of justice, as opposed to merely being of particular importance to these litigants only.</P>
<P>47. It is not necessary that the judge granting leave be satisfied that the decision in question was actually wrong&mdash;the first aspect of the test is satisfied if the judge granting leave finds that the correctness of the order is &ldquo;open to very serious debate&rdquo;.

<P>48. Madam Justice Wilson released her decision after considering a significant volume of materials and extensive submissions from both parties. She reserved judgment on the matter for close to two months and rendered a 75 paragraph, 13 page, single-spaced set of well-reasoned Reasons for Decision.</P>
<P>49. At paragraphs 47 to 53 of Justice Wilson's decision, it is clear that her Honour had considered and applied the legal principles relevant to bifurcation of judge-alone trials in arriving at her conclusion that the discussion in <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> respecting the application of Rule 6.1.01 to judge-alone trials is non-binding obiter dictum and in this regard, she was not bound by it.</P>
<P>50. The Respondent concurs with Justice Wilson's conclusion at paragraph 65 of her decision that the ratio decidendi of <EM>Bondy-Rafael</EM> should be read as applying solely to jury trials.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The matter must be of general importance</TI>
<P>51. Finally, the Appellants must demonstrate matters of importance that go beyond the interests of the immediate parties and involve questions of general or public importance relevant to the development of the law and the administration of justice.

<P>52. The Respondent submits that this case does not meet the threshold of general importance as the determination of whether to bifurcate this trial based on the distinct sets of facts herein will only affect the litigants to this action and not the general public.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>53. The Respondent submits that the Appellants have not met the test to obtain leave to appeal Justice Wilson's decision upholding Master Short's order bifurcating the trial in this action.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>DATE Thursday October 11, 2018</P>
<P>DISPOSITION&mdash;THIS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL</P>
<P>THE DECISION OF Wilson, J.</P>
<P>DATED April 4, 2018 IS</P>
<P>Leave to appeal is granted with respect to the issue of whether the Master had jurisdiction to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages. We agree with Wilson J.'s observation that clarification is required on this issue from an appellate authority. We dismiss the motion for leave with respect to the issue of whether, if jurisdiction did exist bifurcation should have been ordered. Costs of this motion are reserved to the panel hearing the appeal.</P>
