<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>THE APPLICANT GENSTAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP APPEALS to the Court of Appeal from the Judgment of the Honourable Justice A. Poliak dated October 1, 2018, made at Toronto, Ontario.</P>
<P>THE APPELLANT ASKS that the Judgment be set aside and that Judgment be granted as follows:
<P1>1 Directing the Respondent to transfer the Property (as defined below) to the Appellant upon payment of the price calculated by the formula defined in section 5 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale dated August 31, 1998 (the <BOLD>Agreement</BOLD>) between the Respondent and the Appellant's predecessor as of the date the appeal is granted.</P1>
<P1>2 In the alternative, remitting the matter to the Ontario Superior Court and directing that a mini-trial be conducted solely in respect of the issue of succession or assignment, as referred to below;</P1>
<P1>3 Setting aside the costs award in the Application and awarding cost to the Appellant;</P1>
<P1>4 Awarding the Appellant its costs on this appeal; and</P1>
<P1>5 Providing such further and other relief as the Appellant may request and this Honourable Court deem just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL are as follows:</BOLD>
<P1>1 On August 31, 1998, the Appellant's predecessor, Imasco Enterprises Inc. (<BOLD>Imasco</BOLD>), entered into the Agreement with the Respondent to sell to the Respondent the whole of Block 107 on Subdivision Plan 20M-696 in Oakville, Ontario (the <BOLD>Property</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>2 Under the Agreement, if the Respondent failed to develop the Property for a church within 10 years, or if it no longer required the Property for a church, it was required to notify the Appellant. On receiving notice, the Appellant would have the option to repurchase the Property for the original purchase price multiplied by the increase in the Ontario Consumer Price Index (the <BOLD>Repurchase Option</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>3 In 2000, Imasco transferred all assets associated with its real estate business, including its contracts, to Genstar Development Company Limited (<BOLD>Genstar Company</BOLD>) by way of a Transfer Agreement (the <BOLD>2000 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>). In 2001, Genstar Company transferred those assets to the Appellant, Genstar Development Partnership (<BOLD>Genstar</BOLD>) by way of a second transfer agreement</P1>
<P1>4 The Respondent did not develop the Property for a church within 10 years, but it did not notify the Appellant as required under the Agreement.</P1>
<P1>5 In early 2016, the Respondent issued a Request for Proposals soliciting offers to purchase the Property. The Appellant sought to exercise its rights under the Agreement for the repurchase of the Property, including by delivery of funds. The Respondent refused to return the Property.</P1>
<P1>6 The Appellant commenced this Application seeking a remedy of specific performance to compel the Respondent to return the Property in accordance with the terms of the Agreement (and the Repurchase Option specifically).</P1>
<P1>7 The hearing of the Application proceeded on April 11, 2018 before the Honourable Justice Poliak.</P1>
<P1>8 On June 14, 2018, the Application Judge issued an endorsement on her own initiative seeking further submissions on whether &ldquo;the Application should be converted to an Action and a trial of issues&rdquo; on the basis of concerns expressed by the Court over evidentiary gaps and complex legal positions.</P1>
<P1>9 On October 1, 2018, the Application Judge granted Judgment dismissing the Application.</P1>
<P1>10 The Application Judge held that:
<P2>(a) the Court should decide the Application on the existing evidentiary record;</P2>
<P2>(b) on the existing record, it was not possible for the Court to make a finding on whether the Appellant is a successor to Imasco;</P2>
<P2>(c) on the existing record, it was not possible for the Court to make a finding on whether the Appellant is an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option;</P2>
<P2>(d) the Respondent's statement that it was &ldquo;not prepared to sell the Property back to [the Appellant] at this time&rdquo; did not constitute an anticipatory breach of the Agreement, and therefore did not relieve the Applicant from the obligation to tender;</P2>
<P2>(e) the exercise of the Repurchase Option required strict compliance, and the Applicant's errors in calculating the purchase price as stipulated in the Agreement rendered its tenders invalid; and</P2>
<P2>(f) had the Respondent breached the Agreement, specific performance would have been an appropriate equitable remedy in the circumstances.</P2></P1>
<P1>11 The Application Judge made numerous errors of fact and law, and erred in exercising her discretion, as set out below:
<P2>(a) the Application Judge misapprehended the evidence, making a palpable and overriding error in finding that the Appellant has not established its status as a successor of Imasco in the face of clear, uncontradicted and uncross-examined evidence to the contrary;</P2>
<P2>(b) the Application Judge erred in law in misapprehending the test for establishing corporate successorship;</P2>
<P2>(c) the Application Judge exercised her discretion unreasonably and on an improper principle in:
<P3>(i) raising on her own initiative an evidentiary issue which the Respondent had undertaken on cross-examination to take no position on;</P3>
<P3>(ii) inviting supplementary submissions as to the delivery of additional evidence; and</P3>
<P3>(iii) then refusing to hear such evidence,</P3>
resulting in manifest unfairness to the Appellant and the administration of justice;</P2>
<P2>(d) the Application Judge misapprehended the evidence and made a palpable and overriding error in finding that the Appellant had not established its status as an equitable assignee in the face of clear, uncontradicted and uncross-examined evidence to the contrary;</P2>
<P2>(e) the Application Judge erred in law in misapprehending the test for establishing an equitable assignment;</P2>
<P2>(f) The Application Judge erred in law in finding that the Respondent's statement that it was &ldquo;not prepared to sell the Property back to [the Appellant]&rdquo; did not constitute an anticipatory breach of the Agreement, thereby relieving the Appellant of the obligation to tender.</P2>
<P2>(g) The Application Judge erred in law in finding that the Appellant's tender attempts were deficient. In particular, the Application Judge erred in finding that the exercise of the Repurchase Option required strict performance, and that the Respondent &ldquo;was entitled to require a proper tender of the correct purchase price&rdquo;, when in fact only substantial performance was required.</P2></P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD>
<P1>1 This is an appeal of a final decision of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice. Therefore, an appeal lies to this Court as of right, without the necessity to obtain leave to appeal pursuant to section 6(1)(b) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c. 43, as amended.</P1></P>

<P>Lawyers for the Appellant</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The appellant is Genstar Development Partnership (<BOLD>Genstar</BOLD>). Genstar appeals from a decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice dated October 1, 2018 dismissing Genstar's application for specific performance in Superior Court File Number CV-17-570177.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>2. Genstar seeks to enforce its right to repurchase the whole of Block 107 on Subdivision Plan 20M-696 in Oakville, Ontario (the <BOLD>Property</BOLD>) pursuant to an Agreement of Purchase and Sale dated August 31, 1998 (the <BOLD>Agreement</BOLD>) that its predecessor entered into with The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Hamilton in Ontario (the <BOLD>Diocese</BOLD>).</P>
<P>3. The Agreement was executed between Imasco Enterprises Inc. (<BOLD>Imasco</BOLD>) and the Diocese. Through the Agreement, the Property was sold to the Diocese for less than market value due to municipal regulations designating it a &ldquo;place of worship.&rdquo; However, it included a repurchase option: if <EM>either</EM> the Property is not developed for a church within 10 years, <EM>or</EM> if the Property was no longer required for a church, Imasco would be entitled to notification from the Diocese, whereupon it could repurchase the Property.</P>
<P>4. In the early 2000s, through a series of corporate asset transfer agreements, Genstar became the successor to Imasco's real estate business.</P>
<P>5. The Property was not developed for a church. The Diocese failed to notify Genstar though. Instead, in 2016, it put the Property up for sale. When Genstar learned of this, it immediately wrote to the Diocese advising that it intended to repurchase the Property.</P>
<P>6. In response, the Diocese unequivocally refused. In a letter to Genstar dated May 26, 2016, it made its position explicit: &ldquo;...the Diocese <BOLD><UNDER>is not prepared to sell the Property back to [Genstar] at this time</UNDER>.</BOLD>&rdquo;</P>
<P>7. Despite the Diocese's position, Genstar tendered twice. Neither was accepted. The Diocese gave various reasons for its refusal to accept tender, none of which it maintained in the current proceeding. On February 22, 2017, Genstar commenced an application seeking specific performance from the Diocese.</P>
<P>8. On October 1, 2018, the Application Judge dismissed the Application. The grounds for dismissal, at their core, were as follows:
<P1>(a) Genstar had not proven that it was entitled to enforce the Agreement, either as a successor to Imasco or an equitable assignee of the repurchase option; and</P1>
<P1>(b) in any event, Genstar's multiple tenders were deficient on the basis of a minor shortfall of approximately $20,000 in the calculated purchase price, which relieved the Diocese of the obligation to honour the Agreement.</P1></P>
<P>9. These conclusions have no basis in the evidence or law. Rather, Genstar submits that:
<P1>(a) the record firmly establishes that Genstar is both a successor of Imasco and an equitable assignee of the repurchase option, and the Application Judge's finding to the contrary was based on palpable and overriding errors of fact and law; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the Application Judge made clear errors of law in finding that Genstar's deficient tenders prevented it from enforcing the repurchase option, including as follows:
<P2>(i) the Application Judge erred in finding that the Diocese had not committed an anticipatory breach of the Agreement by failing to apply the correct legal test. Any deficiencies in Genstar's tenders were therefore of no import, since the effect of the anticipatory breach was to relieve Genstar from the obligation to tender; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) the Application Judge's erred in holding Genstar to a standard of strict performance in finding that the minor shortfalls in the purchase price calculated by Genstar relieved the Diocese from conveying the Property. In fact, only substantial performance was required of Genstar.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Imasco Sells the Property</TI>
<P>10. As of 1998, Imasco was a North American conglomerate carrying on business as a real estate developer under various trade names, including Genstar Development Company. On August 31, 1998, Imasco and the Diocese entered into the Agreement for the sale of the Property. Imasco sold the Property to the Diocese at a price of $576,000.00 on November 13, 1998.

<P>11. When the Agreement was executed, the Property was designated as a &ldquo;place of worship&rdquo; under municipal planning rules. As a result, Imasco was only permitted to sell the Property to purchasers who planned to use it for its designated purpose. Due to the diminished pool of prospective purchasers, Imasco agreed to sell the Property to the Diocese at significantly below market value. The Agreement explicitly memorialized Genstar's reliance on the Diocese's commitment to develop the Property for such a purpose in electing to proceed with the sale.

<P>12. Under the municipal planning rules, if it became apparent over time that a designated site was no longer required to be used as a place of worship, it could then be used for residential purposes. Accordingly, Imasco and other developers developed a practice of inserting a clause into their sale agreements allowing them to repurchase properties designated as &ldquo;places of worship&rdquo; in the event that the institutional purchaser did not develop the site for a place of worship within a specific time, or no longer intended to use the site for that purpose.
<P1>Koke Affidavit at paras 12-13, ABC, Tab 11, p. 115.</P1></P>
<P>13. Section 5 of the Agreement contained such a clause (the <BOLD>Repurchase Option</BOLD>):
<QUOTE><P>If the Property is not developed for a church within 10 years hereof or if the Property is not required for a church, the Vendor shall be notified thereof and be entitled to repurchase the Property within 90 days of such notification at a price equal to the herein purchase price multiplied by the increase in the Ontario Consumer Price Index between the date of closing hereunder and the date of repurchase.</P></QUOTE>

<P>14. On February 1, 2000, Imasco entered into a Transfer Agreement with Genstar Development Company Limited (<BOLD>GDCL</BOLD>), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada (the <BOLD>2000 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>). Through the 2000 Transfer Agreement, Imasco transferred to GDLC assets related to its business of &ldquo;acquiring, developing and selling real estate&rdquo; (defined in the 2000 Transfer Agreement as &ldquo;the Business&rdquo;).
<P1>Transfer Agreement between Imasco and GDCL dated February 1, 2000 (the <BOLD>2000 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>), Exhibit T to the Koke Affidavit, ABC, Tab 26.</P1></P>
<P>15. The &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; conveyed pursuant to the 2000 Transfer Agreement were defined as follows:
<QUOTE><P>&ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; means all of [Imasco's] right, title and interest in and to its assets, properties, operations and undertaking owned or used solely in connection with the Business, other than the Excluded Assets, including the following:</P>
<P>[...]</P>

<P>&ldquo;Contracts&rdquo; was defined to expressly include, among other things, &ldquo;agreements of purchase and sale&rdquo; such as the Agreement between Imasco and the Diocese.

<P>16. On January 15, 2001, Genstar was formed through a Partnership Agreement between Genstar Development Company, an unlimited liability corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia (as managing partner) and Mr. Stephen Raby (as initial partner). On the same date, GDCL entered into a Transfer Agreement with Genstar (the <BOLD>2001 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>), pursuant to which GDCL transferred all of its assets to Genstar, including the assets it had acquired pursuant to the 2000 Transfer Agreement.

<P>17. &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; was defined in the 2001 Transfer Agreement as follows:
<QUOTE><P>&ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; means all of the [GDCL's] and [Genstar Titleco Limited's] right, title and interest in and to its assets, properties, operations and undertaking, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the following:</P>

<P>(c) the Contracts; [...]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Again, &ldquo;Contracts&rdquo; was defined to expressly include, among other things, &ldquo;agreements of purchase and sale&rdquo; such as the Agreement between Imasco and the Diocese.
<P1>2001 Transfer Agreement at s. 1.1., Exhibit V to the Koke Affidavit, ABC, Tab 27, pp. 397, 399-400.</P1></P>
<P>18. The effect of the Transfer Agreements was to transfer assets held in connection with Imasco's real estate business to Genstar. While the definition of &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; under the 2000 Transfer Agreement carved out certain &ldquo;Excluded Assets&rdquo;, the unchallenged evidence before the Court was that the Agreement was among the contracts conveyed to GDCL.

<P>19. Neither Imasco nor GDLC are currently active in Canada. On February 1, 2000&mdash;the same date on which Imasco transferred its real estate business to Genstar pursuant to the 2000 Transfer Agreement&mdash;Imasco amalgamated with a number of corporations to form Imperial Tobacco Company Limited (<BOLD>Imperial Tobacco</BOLD>).

<P>21. The Property was not developed for a church within 10 years, and indeed still has not been developed for a church. Contrary to section 5 of the Agreement, however, the Diocese did not notify Genstar that it had not developed the Property for a church within the required time.

<P>22. On February 18, 2016, without notice to Genstar, the Diocese issued an RFP soliciting offers to purchase the Property. Genstar was advised of the RFP by a third party in early April 2016. On April 14, 2016, counsel for Genstar wrote to the Diocese enclosing the Agreement and stating that &ldquo;Genstar, as Imasco's successor, is entitled to repurchase the Property.&rdquo;

<P>23. On May 2, 2016, counsel for Genstar advised the Diocese that Genstar would be exercising its right to repurchase the Property and proposed a May 31, 2016 closing date. He provided Genstar's calculation of the purchase price and invited comments from the Diocese:
<QUOTE><P>Without prejudice to Genstar's right to assert that the attached calculation is accurate, <BOLD>if you disagree with the calculation, please advise us immediately as to the basis for that disagreement and your alternative calculation of the purchase price.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>There was no response from the Diocese. In fact, until these proceedings, the Diocese at no time raised any issue regarding Genstar's calculation of the purchase price. Notably, there is no requirement in the Agreement for Genstar to have sole&mdash;or any&mdash;responsibility for conducting the arithmetic.

<P>25. On May 26, 2016, the Diocese responded for the first time, through its solicitor, writing that &ldquo;...the Diocese <BOLD>is not prepared to sell the Property back to [Genstar] at this time.</BOLD>&rdquo; (emphasis added).The Diocese acknowledged that Genstar held a &ldquo;contingent&rdquo; right to repurchase the Property, but took the position that, since the Diocese might still develop the Property for a church at a future date, it was not required to sell the Property to Genstar. In acknowledging Genstar's allegedly &ldquo;contingent&rdquo; interest in the Property, the Diocese did not suggest that Genstar was not entitled to enforce the terms of the Agreement, including the Repurchase Option, as Imasco's successor.
<P1>Letter from N. Claridge to P. O'Donoghue dated May 26, 2016, Exhibit I to the Koke Affidavit, ABC, Tab 16, p. 153.</P1></P>
<P>26. The same day, Genstar's solicitor wrote to the Diocese's solicitor setting out Genstar's continuing intention to repurchase the Property. Counsel also advised of an error in the previous calculation of the repurchase price and enclosed Genstar's revised calculations. Once again, Genstar's counsel specifically identified the calculation in his correspondence and requested that the Diocese advise if it had any disagreement.

<P>27. In response, on May 27, 2016, the Diocese's solicitor wrote to Genstar's solicitor asserting once again that Genstar's right to repurchase the Property had not been triggered. Despite the Diocese's position, Genstar's solicitor responded that Genstar was ready, willing and able to complete the repurchase and would proceed to tender, if necessary, on May 31, 2016.

<P>28. On May 31, 2016, Genstar's solicitor tendered with the required documentation (the <BOLD>First Tender</BOLD>). The tender documentation included a certified cheque in the amount of $804,303.16, and an Acknowledgment and Direction executed by Genstar, authorizing its solicitor, among other things, to correct any incorrect dates, amounts or other information in the Transfer document. However, the Diocese refused to close, claiming that there were three deficiencies in Genstar's tender documentation, none of which had been mentioned prior to the date of the First Tender. None of the purported deficiencies related to the calculation of the purchase price that had been tendered.

<P>29. On June 16, 2016, Genstar's solicitor advised that Genstar believed that the First Tender was not deficient, but would nonetheless take steps to rectify the issues raised by the Diocese and re-tender on June 28, 2016. In the same letter, Genstar's solicitor enclosed calculations of the repurchase price, adjusted to the new proposed closing date of June 28, 2016.

Tlhe Diocese again refused to close. Despite the Diocese's refusal, Genstar continued to be ready, willing and able to complete the repurchase of the Property.

<P>31. During the current proceeding, it became apparent that the First Tender and the Second Tender each included a purchase price of approximately $20,000 less than was required under the Agreement due to an inadvertent error in Genstar's calculations. The difference in the purchase price required under the agreement ($825,389.01) and that tendered by Genstar ($805,100.94) was $20,288.07, or approximately 2.5%.

<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI>The Decision under Appeal</TI>
<P>32. Genstar commenced this Application on February 22, 2017 to enforce its rights under the Agreement. Specifically, Genstar sought a remedy of specific performance to compel the Diocese to return the Property in accordance with the Repurchase Option contained in the Agreement. The hearing of the Application proceeded on April 11, 2018 before the Honourable Justice Poliak.</P>
<P>33. On June 14, 2018, on her own initiative, the Application Judge issued an endorsement seeking further submissions on whether &ldquo;the Application should be converted to an Action and a trial of issues.&rdquo; The Application Judge noted that in appropriate circumstances, the Court could order a trial of an issue rather than a full trial to address a &ldquo;dispute in the evidence&rdquo;.

<P>34. The request for further submissions arose at least in part from a perceived evidentiary gap that the Application Judge had herself identified at the hearing, relating to documentation establishing whether Genstar was a successor of Imasco:
<QUOTE><P>[Genstar] has submitted documentation with respect to the corporate reorganization of Imasco, and urges the Court to find on the basis of such documentation that it is a successor to Imasco. It became apparent to the Court during the hearing of the Application that a significant portion of the relevant documentation with respect to the Applicant's status was missing.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>June Endorsement at para 19, ABC, Tab 3, p. 13.</P1></P>
<P>35. In submissions delivered pursuant to the June 14, 2018 endorsement, Genstar urged the Court not to convert the proceeding to an action. Genstar further submitted that, should the Court require supplementary evidence to determine the issue of Genstar's status as a successor of Imasco, it was prepared to deliver targeted evidence in order to allow the Court to make a determination. Genstar noted that similar approaches have been undertaken recently by the Ontario Superior Court in order to facilitate just, expeditious and cost-effective resolutions to litigation.

<P1>Genstar's Further Submissions dated July 3, 2018, ABC, Tab 44.</P1></P>
<P>36. On October 1, 2018, without reviewing any additional evidence, the Application Judge granted Judgment dismissing the Application. The Application Judge held that:
<P1>(a) the Court should decide the Application on the existing evidentiary record;</P1>
<P1>(b) on the existing record, it was not possible for the Court to make a finding on whether the Genstar is a successor to Imasco or an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option;</P1>
<P1>(c) the Diocese's statement that it was &ldquo;not prepared to sell the Property back to [Genstar] at this time&rdquo; did not constitute an anticipatory breach of the Agreement, and therefore did not relieve the Applicant from the obligation to tender;</P1>
<P1>(d) the exercise of the Repurchase Option required strict compliance, and the Applicant's errors in calculating the purchase price as stipulated in the Agreement rendered its tenders invalid; and</P1>
<P1>(e) had the Respondent breached the Agreement, specific performance would have been an appropriate equitable remedy in the circumstances.</P1>
<P1>Reasons for Judgment of Justice Pollack dated October 1, 2018 (the <BOLD>Reasons</BOLD>), ABC, Tab 4.</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV&mdash;ISSUES AND THE LAW</TI>
<P>37. The Application Judge made numerous errors of both fact and law in holding that:
<P1>(a) Genstar is not a successor of Imasco;</P1>
<P1>(b) Genstar is not an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option;</P1>
<P1>(c) Genstar's &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; tenders foreclosed its ability to enforce the Repurchase Option, including in finding that:
<P2>(i) the Diocese did not commit an anticipatory breach of the Agreement; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) the exercise of the Repurchase Option required strict compliance.</P2></P1></P>
<P>38. Further, the Application Judge erred in failing to exercise her discretion to allow the parties to adduce additional evidence on the issue of whether Genstar was a successor of Imasco, or alternatively, an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The Standard of Review</TI>
<P>39. The standard of review on a question of law is correctness. Questions of law include, among other things, the identification of the appropriate legal test to be applied in the circumstances. Where the correct legal test is identified, the <EM>application</EM> of the correct legal test generally involves questions of mixed fact and law, which attract a standard of palpable and overriding error.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Housen</EM></BOLD>) at para 8, Appellant's Book of Authorities (<BOLD>ABA</BOLD>), Tab 6.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Airia Brands Inc. v. Air Canada</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 792</CITE><PARANUM>38-39</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 1.</P1></P>
<P>40. With respect to an error arising from the failure to consider pertinent evidence, an appellate court is justified in intervening if the omission in the reasons leads to a reasonable belief that the application judge &ldquo;must have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected [his or her] conclusion&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Housen</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 39, ABA, Tab 6.</P1></P>
<P>41. The interpretation of commercial contracts, including the Agreement and the Transfer Agreements at issue in this case, is a question of mixed fact and law and&mdash;absent an extricable error of law&mdash;is also reviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error. That standard is met where a finding was &ldquo;clearly wrong&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsupported by the evidence&rdquo;, or where the appellate court &ldquo;can plainly identify the imputed error, and that error is shown to have affected the result&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Heritage Capital Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co.</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 5.</P1>

<P>42. Finally, a discretionary decision of a lower court will be reversible where that court misdirected itself or came to a decision that is so clearly wrong that it amounts to an injustice. Reversing a lower court's discretionary decision is also appropriate where the lower court gives no or insufficient weight to relevant considerations.

<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Genstar is Imasco's Successor</TI>
<P>43. The Application Judge correctly identified the legal test for corporate successorship, but made palpable and overriding errors of fact in applying it on the record. As held by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>National Trust Co. v. Mead</SOC></CASEREF>, and as correctly stated by the Application Judge, a &ldquo;successor&rdquo; denotes &ldquo;another corporation which, through merger, amalgamation or some other type of legal succession, assumes the burdens and becomes vested with the rights of the first corporation.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>National Trust Co. v. Mead</SOC><CITE>[1990] 2 SCR 410</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Mead</EM></BOLD>) at para 27, ABA, Tab 12.</P1></P>
<P>44. On this test, the record required a finding that Genstar is Imasco's successor. The Application Judge's finding that it was not possible for the Court to make such a determination was based on palpable and overriding errors of fact.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The Application Judge Ignored Key Evidence</TI>
<P>45. The Application Judge held that it was &ldquo;not possible&rdquo; to make a finding on the issue of successorship on the record. Critically, however, the unchallenged evidence before the Court was that Genstar was the successor to Imasco's real estate business. In particular, the evidence before the Application Judge was as follows, as excerpted from the Application Judge's Reasons for Judgment:
<QUOTE><P>... In 1998, Imasco was a North American conglomerate which carried on business in Canada and elsewhere under various trade names including Genstar Development Company. <BOLD>In late 1999 and early 2000, Imasco transferred various assets, including the transfer of assets from Imasco to Genstar in early 2000.</BOLD></P>
<P>On or about February 1, 2000, Imasco and Genstar Development Company Limited (<BOLD>GDCL</BOLD>), a corporation governed by the laws of Canada, entered into a Transfer Agreement pursuant to which Imasco transferred all of the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;, as defined in the Transfer Agreement, to GDCL. <BOLD>Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts...</BOLD></P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>On January 15, 2001, GDCL entered into a Transfer Agreement with Genstar, pursuant to which GDCL transferred to Genstar all of the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;, as defined in the Transfer Agreement...</P>
<P>To summarize, the chain of ownership is as follows:
<P1>Imasco &darr; GDCL &darr; Genstar</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons at para 28, ABC, Tab 3, pp. 22-23. (emphasis added)</P1></P>
<P>46. The Diocese had the opportunity to cross-examine Genstar's affiant on that evidence, but declined to do so. The Diocese also had the opportunity to adduce evidence of its own to dispute Genstar's evidence of its successorship from Imasco. Again, it did not do so. Accordingly, the <EM>only</EM> evidence before the Court relating to Genstar established unequivocally that Genstar is a successor to Imasco.
<P1>Transcript of the Cross-Examination of John Koke dated June 15, 2017, ABC, Tab 8.</P1></P>
<P>47. While the Application Judge reproduced the relevant portions of Genstar's evidence, it is clear that she either ignored or grossly misconceived that evidence in holding that &ldquo;it is not possible for the Court to make a finding on the issue of successor status of the Applicant.&rdquo; The failure to give effect to or otherwise substantively address uncontroverted evidence was a palpable and overriding error of fact. It was also fundamental to the outcome.
<P1>Reasons at para 34, ABC, Tab 4, p. 25.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>The Application Judge Misinterpreted the 2000 Transfer Agreement</TI>
<P>48. Second, the Application Judge erred in interpreting the 2000 Transfer Agreement, and in particular, in determining that the omission of certain schedules from the 2000 Transfer Agreement severed the chain of succession between Imasco and Genstar.</P>
<P>49. As set out above, the Application Judge held that it was &ldquo;not possible&rdquo; to make a finding on the issue of successorship on the record. The Application Judge's rationale was that the record did not include certain schedules to the 2000 Transfer Agreement:
<QUOTE><P>A review of the supporting documentation, which is relied on by the Applicant however, does not disclose which of the &ldquo;burdens and rights&rdquo; have been transferred as schedules to the Agreements defining the &ldquo;assumed assets and liabilities&rdquo; have not been included in the record.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>On examination of the evidentiary record, I find that as it is lacking relevant documents, it is not possible for the Court to make a finding on the issue of successor status of the Applicant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons at para 32, ABC, Tab 4, p. 24.</P1></P>
<P>50. To be precise, the source of the Application Judge's concern appears to have been that the record did not included a schedule (Schedule 2.2) that described &ldquo;Excluded Assets&rdquo; which were assets excluded from the 2000 Transfer Agreement. There was no material documentation omitted from the record relating to the <UNDER>2001</UNDER> Transfer Agreement.
<P1>2000 Transfer Agreement at s. 2.2, Exhibit T to the Koke Affidavit, ABC, Tab 26, p. 189.</P1>
<P1>2001 Transfer Agreement, Exhibit V to the Koke Affidavit, ABC, Tab 28.</P1></P>
<P>51. The Application Judge improperly and unduly fixated on the absence of Schedule 2.2 in rejecting Genstar's arguments with respect to successorship. Notably, no request to see Schedule 2.2 was made on cross-examination. In light of the record as a whole, the absence of Schedule 2.2 was a red herring; Schedule 2.2 was not necessary for the disposition of the matter. Both the direct, uncontested evidence and a contextual interpretation of the Transfer Agreements lead inexorably to the conclusion that Genstar is Imasco's successor, having acquired Imasco's real estate assets through the Transfer Agreements. At its most basic, the Application Judge asked herself the wrong question&mdash;&ldquo;how do I know the Agreement was not an Excluded Asset?&rdquo;&mdash;when the affiant had already given the answer: &ldquo;Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts.&rdquo;</P>
<P>52. Moreover, in interpreting commercial contracts, the overriding concern is to determine &ldquo;the intent of the parties and the scope of their understanding.&rdquo; The Court must read the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, <BOLD>&ldquo;consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of the contract's formation.</BOLD>&rdquo; (emphasis added). The Court is required to avoid interpretations that give rise to commercial absurdities.

<P>53. The evidence of the surrounding circumstances is that:
<P1>(a) Genstar, writ large, was the real estate and development arm of Imasco;</P1>
<P1>(b) Imasco undertook a general program of spinning out non-core assets and amalgamating into Imperial Tobacco;</P1>
<P1>(c) Imasco generally divested its real estate and developmental assets to a new Genstar entity; and</P1>
<P1>(d) on the same day Imasco transferred its assets to Genstar, Imasco amalgamated with Imperial Tobacco.</P1>

<P1>Corporate Profile Report of GDCL, Exhibit G to the Ma Affidavit, ABC, Tab 34, pp. 432&ndash;435.</P1></P>
<P>54. By fixating on the absent schedule and ignoring the evidence before her, the Application Judge came to an unreasonable and highly speculative conclusion: that notwithstanding Imasco's dissolution and general divestitures, the particular contract pertaining to the Diocese could have been somehow left behind, as a stranded asset.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>The Legal Test Required a Finding of Successorship on the Facts</TI>
<P>55. Had the Application Judge correctly apprehended the evidence, including the nature of the transfers undertaken pursuant to the 2000 and 2001 Transfer Agreements, the governing legal test would have required a finding that GDCL and subsequently Genstar was Imasco's successor.</P>
<P>56. As set out above, the Application Judge correctly stated that &ldquo;successor&rdquo; denotes &ldquo;another corporation which, through merger, amalgamation or some other type of legal succession, assumes the burdens and becomes vested with the rights of the first corporation.&rdquo; Critically, the test for corporate successorship from <EM>Mead</EM> does not require that a corporation assume <EM>every</EM> burden, or become vested with <EM>every</EM> right, of another company in order to be a successor. Indeed, in <CASEREF><SOC>Pillar Securitisation S.A.R.L. v. Sinha Estate (Trustee of)</SOC></CASEREF>, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench considered the issue of successorship in the context of new legal entities that had been created through a corporate restructuring. The Court held as follows:
<QUOTE><P>... [the plaintiff] is a &ldquo;successor&rdquo; to [the original corporation], as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada, since through &ldquo;merger&rdquo; (here &ldquo;demerger&rdquo;) or &ldquo;some other type of legal succession&rdquo;, [the plaintiff] &ldquo;assumed the burdens and became vested with the rights of the first corporation&rdquo;. <BOLD>The fact that [the plaintiff] did not assume all of them is not determinative in this situation.</BOLD> (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Mead</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 27, ABA, Tab 12.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Pillar Securitisation S.A.R.L. v. Sinha Estate (Trustee of)</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 355</CITE><PARANUM>16, 19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 14.</P1></P>
<P>57. Therefore, neither the fact that the Transfer Agreements related solely to Imasco's real estate business nor the omission of certain &ldquo;Excluded Assets&rdquo;, is determinative of whether GDCL, and subsequently Genstar, was Imasco's successor. It is sufficient that the Transfer Agreements conveyed Imasco's entire business of acquiring, developing and selling real estate.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iv.</N><TI>The Application Judge Erred in Exercising her Discretion</TI>
<P>58. In the alternative, if the record could not support a finding of corporate successorship, the Application Judge should have exercised her discretion to order a trial of the issue.</P>
<P>59. The omission of documentation related to the 2000 Transfer Agreement was raised for the first time by the Application Judge at the hearing of the Application on April 11, 2018. The issue had not been identified at any time by the Diocese which, as described above, had expressly taken no position on the issue of Genstar's successorship from Imasco.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The issue of successorship first arose in this proceeding slightly earlier on January 29, 2018, when the Diocese served an amended factum that characterized Genstar as a &ldquo;possible assignee&rdquo; of the Agreement rather than a successor. However, this characterization was advanced to support the Diocese's argument that the assignment of the Agreement was ineffective because no written notice had been provided to the Diocese. The Diocese did not assert that the Transfer Agreements were deficient in any regard.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<P1>Long Transcript at q. 13, ABC, Tab 7, p. 31.</P1></P>
<P>60. The emergence of the Court's concern regarding the missing Schedule 2.2 to the 2000 Transfer Agreement was reflected in the June Endorsement in which, as described above, the Application Judge on her own initiative requested written submissions on whether the Application should be converted to an Action and a trial of issues.</P>
<P>61. In submissions dated June 21, 2018, Genstar resisted the conversion of the application to an action with a full trial, arguing that this would be a &ldquo;draconian procedural step&rdquo;. However, Genstar acknowledged that &ldquo;the evidentiary record lacks certain potentially relevant information&rdquo; and suggested that a tailored solution involving the provision of targeted supplementary evidence was appropriate. Genstar submitted that &ldquo;subject to the provision of supplementary evidence in accordance with these submissions, there is no reason that the dispute cannot be fully and fairly determined under the current [application] process.&rdquo;
<P1>Genstar's Further Submissions dated June 21, 2018 at paras 8, 13, 17 ABC, Tab 42, pp. 552, 554&ndash;556.</P1></P>
<P>62. The Application Judge declined to order such an approach, and proceeded to decide the application on a record on which, in her own assessment, &ldquo;it is not possible for the Court to make a finding on the issue of successor status of the [Genstar].&rdquo;
<P1>Reasons at para 34, ABC, Tab 4, p. 24.</P1></P>
<P>63. The Ontario Superior Court has held that where there are material facts in dispute that go to the core of a claim, the interests of justice and procedural fairness require that additional evidence be adduced. As an example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Yip v. Deng</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Superior Court was faced with a dispute in which the record was &ldquo;simply not adequate&rdquo; to permit the Court to make a decision. Justice Dunphy tailored a customized short hearing to address the issue fairly and expeditiously through <EM>viva voce</EM> evidence, despite the parties' desire to proceed on the existing record.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Przysuski v. City Optical Holdings Inc.</SOC><CITE>2013 ONSC 5709</CITE><PARANUM>17-18</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 15.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Yip v. Deng</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 5834</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 22.</P1></P>
<P>64. In the circumstances, it was manifestly unfair to Genstar, and antithetical to the interests of justice, for the Application Judge to decide the application on a record that was in her own assessment so deficient that it precluded the Court from making finding on a key issue. This is particularly so where the gaps in documentation were only identified by the Application Judge herself at the hearing of the application. To the extent that the omissions gave rise to uncertainty with respect to key material facts, it was incumbent on the Application Judge to accept additional evidence in order to permit the Court to make a fair finding.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>Genstar is an Equitable Assignee of the Repurchase Option</TI>
<P>65. For Genstar to be entitled to exercise the Repurchase Option, this Court must find that Genstar was either a successor of Imasco or an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option. As confirmed by this Court, equity &ldquo;does not require a particular form to effect a valid assignment, but whatever form is used must clearly show an intention that the assignee is to have the benefit of the debt or chose in action assigned.&rdquo; While the Application Judge correctly identified this legal test, she ignored or misconceived the evidence of the record in determining that the test was not satisfied, committing palpable and overriding errors of fact.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Nadeau v. Caparelli</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 730</CITE><PARANUM>19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 11.</P1></P>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The Application Judge Ignored Key Evidence</TI>
<P>66. The critical question for the Court to consider in determining whether there was an equitable assignment of the Repurchase Option was simply whether there was an intention to transfer the Agreement pursuant to both the 2000 and 2001 Transfer Agreements. Mirroring her finding on successorship, the Application Judge found that &ldquo;it is not possible for the Court to properly consider whether the corporate documents relied on support a finding of an equitable assignment of the [Repurchase Option].&rdquo;</P>
<P>67. Once again, this finding failed to account for uncontested evidence on the record establishing that &ldquo;[i]n late 1999 and early 2000, Imasco transferred various assets, including the transfer of assets from Imasco to Genstar in early 2000&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<BOLD>Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts.</BOLD>&rdquo; (emphasis added) The evidence plainly supported a finding that Imasco and GDCL, respectively, intended to assign the Agreement and Repurchase Option therein. The evidence of the surrounding circumstances, as set out above, is to the same effect.
<P1>Reasons at paras 28, 38, ABC, Tab 4, pp. 22-23, 25.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>There Was No Requirement to Join the Assignor</TI>
<P>68. While it was not considered by the Application Judge, there was no requirement in the circumstances for Genstar to join either Imasco or GDCL as assignors of the Repurchase Option or give notice, as argued by the Diocese below. While Rule 5.03(3) requires <EM>prima facie</EM> that an &ldquo;assignor shall be joined as a party unless ... notice in writing has been given to the person liable in respect of the ... chose in action that it has been assigned&rdquo;, the requirement is subject to the Court's ability to grant relief, and this Court has confirmed that the joinder requirement must be interpreted purposively:
<QUOTE><P>The joinder requirement is intended to guard the debtor against a possible second action by the assignor and to permit the debtor to pursue any remedies it may have against the assignor without initiating another action. Where the assignee's failure to join the assignor does not prejudice the debtor, the court may grant the relief in rule 5.03(6).</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Landmark Vehicle Leasing Corp. v. Mister Twister Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 545</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> (citations omitted), ABA, Tab 8.</P1></P>
<P>69. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gentra Canada Investments Inc. v. Lipson</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court held that an assignor need not be joined as a party in circumstances where &ldquo;it is clear that the assignor, a company, had no interest in the chose and had ceased to exist.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gentra Canada Investments Inc. v. Lipson</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 331</CITE><PARANUM>62</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 3.</P1></P>
<P>70. In this case, the record definitively establishes that Imasco and GDCL are not active entities and could not possibly assert an interest in the Repurchase Option. There is therefore no prejudice to the Diocese in allowing Genstar to enforce the Repurchase Option on its own.

<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>The Application Judge Erred in Exercising her Discretion</TI>
<P>71. In the alternative, if the record did not support a finding that Genstar is an equitable assignee of the Repurchase Option, then the Application Judge erred in failing to exercise her discretion to accept additional evidence, for the reasons set out above in the context of successorship.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>Genstar's Tenders Did Not Preclude Enforcement of the Repurchase Option</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The Application Judge Erred in Failing to Find an Anticipatory Breach</TI>
<P>72. Anticipatory breach (sometimes called anticipatory repudiation) occurs &ldquo;if the words and conduct evince an intention to breach a term of the contract which, if actually breached, would constitute repudiation of the contract.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Remedy Drug Store Co. v Farnham</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 576</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Remedy Drug Store</EM></BOLD>) at paras 42, 43, ABA, Tab 16.</P1></P>
<P>73. The Application Judge found no anticipatory breach. Her reasons were as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The evidence is that the position of the Diocese throughout was that it had no obligation to sell the property to the Applicant. There were numerous email exchanges between the parties with respect to the issue of whether the Diocese accepted the Applicant's position that it had the authority to exercise the Right pursuant to the Agreement. I do not find that the statement relied on by the Applicant, when considered in the context of the numerous communications between the parties with respect to the respective rights of the parties, establishes an anticipatory breach as argued by the Applicant.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons at para 42. ABC, Tab 4, p. 25..</P1></P>
<P>74. The Application Judge erred in failing to identify or apply the test for anticipatory breach. In assessing whether an anticipatory breach has occurred, &ldquo;the court is to ask <BOLD>whether a reasonable person would conclude</BOLD> that the breaching party no longer intends to be bound by [the contract].&rdquo; (emphasis added).
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Spirent Communications of Ottawa Ltd. v. Quake Technologies (Canada) Inc.</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 92</CITE><PARANUM>37</PARANUM></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 20.</P1></P>
<P>75. Arguably the Diocese had already committed a clear and ongoing breach of the Agreement in failing to give notice to Genstar to allow it to exercise the Repurchase Option. Regardless, the Diocese was clearly stating it was not going to perform. Even if the Diocese believed it had a valid excuse for non-performance under the Agreement, the assessment of whether an anticipatory breach has occurred depends on the interpretation of the Agreement, not the Diocese's self-interested view of its rights: to the extent that Genstar was entitled to exercise the Repurchase Option, the Diocese's statement that it would refuse to close was a anticipatory breach.
<P1><EM>Remedy Drug Store</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 42, 43, ABA, Tab 16.</P1></P>
<P>76. The effect of the Diocese's anticipatory breach was to relieve Genstar of any obligation to tender. This Court has accepted the proposition that &ldquo;[w]here the obligee has manifested to the obligor that tender, if made, will not be accepted, the obligor is excused from making tender...&rdquo;. In <CASEREF><SOC>Silverberg v. 1054384 Ontario Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Strathy, as he then was, confirmed that &ldquo;the law does not require what would be a meaningless or futile gesture.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McCallum v Zivojinovic</SOC><YEAR>1977</YEAR><CITE>16 OR (2d) 721</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at paras 15-16, 23, ABA, Tab 10.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Silverberg v. 1054384 Ontario Ltd</SOC><CITE>[2008] OJ No 4585</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2009 ONCA 698</CITE><PARANUM>102</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, ABA, Tab 19A, citing Paul M. Perell and Bruce H. Engell, <EM>Remedies and the Sale of Land, 2nd ed.</EM>, (Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1998).</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>Genstar was Not Required to Meet a Standard of Strict Compliance</TI>
<P>77. Contrary to the Application Judge's finding, Genstar's tenders were not so deficient as to relieve the Diocese from performing its obligations. It was an error of law for the Application Judge to require strict performance with the terms of the Repurchase Option in the circumstances. On the correct standard of substantial performance, the shortfall of approximately 2.5% of the purchase price did not have the effect of rendering Genstar's tenders invalid.</P>
<P>78. Historically, courts have required options to be strictly performed to give rise to liability on the part of the optionor. The rationale for this standard, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Sail Labrador Ltd. v. Navimar Corp</SOC></CASEREF>, was the unilateral nature of options. In contrast, the doctrine of substantial non-performance applies to bilateral contracts, requiring a defect to attain a minimum degree of seriousness before the non-offending party is entitled to rescind a contract. As the Supreme Court made clear in <EM>Sail Labrador</EM>, not all options are unilateral contracts; some options are elements of bilateral contracts in which they are contained. Indeed, the Diocese readily acknowledged that the Repurchase Option was part of a bilateral contract in the Agreement, through which the Diocese received a clear benefit in acquiring the Property for below market value. As a result, the Diocese was <EM>prima facie</EM> only entitled to resile from its obligations in the event of &ldquo;substantial nonperformance&rdquo; by Genstar.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Sail Labrador Ltd. v. Navimar Corp.</SOC><CITE>[1998] SCJ No 69</CITE></CASEREF> (<BOLD><EM>Sail Labrador</EM></BOLD>) at paras 31, 37&ndash;39, ABA, Tab 17.</P1></P>
<P>79. The corollary to the requirement of substantial performance by the purchaser is the vendor's duty to act in good faith and to take all reasonable steps to complete a transaction of purchase and sale. This includes a duty of flexibility in cases involving minor omissions or defects, such as the shortfall in the purchase price calculated by Genstar. In such circumstances, requirements of precision will not be imposed.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Leung v Leung</SOC><YEAR>1990</YEAR><CITE>75 OR (2d) 786</CITE><COURTJUR>Gen Div</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras 42&ndash;45, ABA, Tab 9.</P1></P>
<P>80. Critically, the Agreement does not specify which party bore the responsibility of calculating the purchase price in respect of the Repurchase Option. Given that Genstar provided the Diocese with its draft calculations and explicitly sought its input, it was incumbent upon the Diocese to review and advise Genstar of any deficiencies. It did not do so.</P>
<P>81. Finally, a vendor cannot refuse to close as long as the purchaser indicates a willingness to provide any additional amount owing. Genstar has always been willing to provide the amounts necessary to complete the transaction: indeed, it executed an undertaking to allow its solicitor make any necessary adjustments at the time of each tender, and continues to be ready, willing and able to repurchase the Property at the correct price.

<P1>Koke Reply Affidavit at paras 3-4, ABC, Tab 36, p. 443.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>E. Specific Performance is Appropriate in the Circumstances</TI>
<P>82. The Application Judge correctly found that specific performance was appropriate in the circumstances. The Application Judge rejected the Diocese's argument that there was the requirement to show uniqueness of the Property, holding instead that specific performance was warranted based on &ldquo;uncontradicted evidence surrounding the circumstances of the sale of the property to the Diocese supports the finding that it was the intent of the parties that specific performance be awarded if the property was not developed for use as a church.&rdquo;
<P1>Reasons at para 51, ABC, Tab 4, p. 27.</P1></P>
<P>83. In reaching this conclusion, the Application Judge appropriately relied on <CASEREF><SOC>Kahlen v Vogel Construction Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, in which the Ontario Superior Court of Justice considered whether an order directing the reconveyance of land for a sum specified under an agreement was appropriate. The Court held that specific performance was appropriate because the parties had specifically contracted for reconveyance in the event of a breach: &ldquo;[t]he parties, by their agreement, established the appropriate remedy for non-compliance. It is not appropriate for the court to alter the contract. ...&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kahlen v. Vogel Construction Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2006] O.J. No. 521</CITE><COURTJUR>SCJ</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 69, ABA, Tab 7.</P1></P>
<P>84. In any event, the Property is also unique: a substitute for the Property is not available since the subdivision where the Property is located was fully developed and sold by 2008.

<P>1. This appeal concerns an application brought by the appellant, Genstar Development Partnership (&ldquo;<BOLD>Genstar</BOLD>&rdquo;), for specific performance (only) of an Option (defined below). Genstar is not a party to the Option, yet seeks to enforce it in circumstances where Genstar, as the purported purchaser, failed to meet the most basic terms of the Option, being the payment of the full Purchase Price (defined below), on time.</P>
<P>2. In an endorsement released October 1, 2018, the Honourable Madam Justice Poliak dismissed Genstar's application, finding that Genstar failed to establish that it was a successor to Imasco (defined below) and, having failed to notify The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Hamilton in Ontario (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Diocese</BOLD>&rdquo;) of multiple assignments of the Option, Genstar was not entitled to exercise it. It was also found that even if Genstar was entitled to exercise the Option, Genstar's purported tender thereunder was materially deficient.</P>
<P>3. Having found that Genstar was not entitled to exercise the Option, it was unnecessary for the application judge to determine whether Genstar was entitled to specific performance. Nonetheless, it was found that if there had been a breach of the Option, it was the &ldquo;intent of the parties that specific performance be awarded if the property was not developed for use as a church. There [was] therefore no requirement for [Genstar] to show specific uniqueness of the property&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Endorsement of Justice Poliak dated October 1, 2018 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Decision</BOLD>&rdquo;), para 51, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Diocese respectfully disagrees with that conclusion, which was incorrect at law.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Overview</TI>
<P>4. On August 31, 1998, Imasco Enterprises Inc. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Imasco</BOLD>&rdquo;) agreed to sell (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Sale Contract</BOLD>&rdquo;) the Property (defined in the appellant's factum) to the Diocese.</P>
<P>5. The Sale Contract contained a <EM>bare</EM> option (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Option</BOLD>&rdquo;) allowing <EM>Imasco</EM> an ability to repurchase the Property, if the Property was not developed for a church within 10 years (i.e. by August 31, 2008) or if the Property was not required for a church (individually, a &ldquo;<BOLD>Triggering Event</BOLD>&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Triggering Events</BOLD>&rdquo;). The Property was not developed for a church within 10 years, and the Option crystallized on August 31, 2008, or the next day. If the Option was exercised within a reasonable time, the sole performance of the optionee was to pay the proper purchase price for the Property, on time.</P>
<P>6. Genstar's appeal suffers from a fundamental problem: Genstar has no legal or equitable entitlement to exercise the Option. Genstar is, <EM>at best</EM>, a possible (second) assignee of the Option in which case notice had to be given to the Diocese to make the assignment valid. Genstar, and its purported assignors, failed to give the Diocese any notice of the alleged assignments (including the assignment to Genstar).</P>
<P>7. To avoid this problem, Genstar presents itself as a &ldquo;successor&rdquo; of Imasco. However, the application judge rightly found that the evidence produced by Genstar, which included an incomplete record of the corporate transfers relied upon by Genstar, was insufficient to support a finding that Genstar is Imasco's successor. Notably, Genstar decided not to produce schedules to the relevant transfer agreements that describe the assets <EM>excluded</EM> from that transfer. Taken at its highest, the evidence tendered by Genstar supports the conclusion that Genstar is an indirect assignee of some of the assets of Imasco (which assets do not necessarily include the Option). The application judge rightly found that it was not possible for the court to determine whether Genstar was the successor of Imasco.</P>
<P>8. Genstar further sought to avoid its failure to give notice of the assignment of the Option by calling itself an &ldquo;equitable assignee&rdquo;. However, just as it failed to produce evidence of its purported status as successor, the application judge rightly found that Genstar's evidence did not support a finding that it was an equitable assignee of the Option. Genstar's conduct as described below is also not equitable.</P>
<P>9. Genstar also appeals the application judge's exercise of her discretion declining Genstar's request to <EM>attempt</EM> to shore up its incomplete evidentiary record by submitting new evidence, which Genstar suggested should be tendered, if necessary, after it submitted its case on the existing record. The application judge rightly found that it would be improper to allow Genstar to introduce new evidence at such a late stage, after receiving comments and a ruling from the court.</P>
<P>10. Incredibly, Genstar now complains about process, despite choosing the original method of proceeding, insisting that its application continue as such and not be converted to a trial, and after failing to request an adjournment to provide the court with the necessary documents or additional evidence on this issue. Having made all of the foregoing choices, Genstar's complaints are hollow, and unjustified. The proceeding at first instance &ldquo;is not a dress rehearsal&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lo v Ho</SOC><CITE>2010 ONSC 662</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Respondent (&ldquo;<BOLD>Respondent's Authorities</BOLD>&rdquo;), Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Whatever Genstar's stratagem was in not submitting the material documents, it is now not open to Genstar to ask for review. Moreover, Genstar's argument on appeal wrongly assumes that the documents it chose not to file will be resolved in its favour.</P>
<P>11. The application judge found that Genstar's attempt to exercise any right under the Option was deficient. Specifically, the Option provides that Imasco must pay the price stipulated therein (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Purchase Price</BOLD>&rdquo;), on time. Section 9 of the Sale Contract provides, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that &ldquo;[time] shall in all respects be of the essence hereof...&rdquo;. The proper Purchase Price was not tendered on time, and was deficient by more than $20,000.00. The sole performance required to exercise the Option did not occur.</P>
<P>12. The dismissal of Genstar's application is well-reasoned, grounded in evidence, and applies the correct legal tests Genstar's appeal is an attempt to reargue its case. Its appeal should be dismissed. No reversible error has been identified.</P>
<P>13. In the alternative, should the decision of the application judge be reversed, then it is submitted that she erred at law in finding that uniqueness of the Property was not necessary for the appellant to obtain specific performance. The application judge also failed to consider at all the issue of delay (of 8 years) in seeking such remedy.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(a)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Option</EM></TI>
<P>14. The Sale Contract between Imasco and the Diocese closed on November 13, 1998 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>1998 Transfer</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transfer, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 6, p. 42; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. The Option allowed a repurchase of the Property from the Diocese, if either of the Triggering Events occurred. The Option provides:
<QUOTE><P>5. ...</P>
<P>If the Property is not developed for a church within 10 years hereof or if the Property is not required for a church, <BOLD>the Vendor</BOLD> shall be notified thereof and <BOLD>be entitled to repurchase the Property within 90 days of such notification at a price equal to the herein purchase price multiplied by the increase in the Ontario Consumer Price Index between the date of closing hereunder and the date of repurchase.</BOLD> [Emphasis added.]<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 5, Agreement of Purchase and Sale, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 6, pp. 37&ndash;45; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 14&ndash;22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. As for Imasco's rights under section 5 of the Option, it had the right to be notified of a Triggering Event, and it also had the ability to purchase the Property. However, the latter was not condition al on the former.</P>
<P>17. The right of notice and right to purchase in the Option are not co-dependant. In 2016, Genstar asserted the right to purchase the Property, although no notice was given to it by the Diocese (which did not know of Genstar). The same was true in September 2008, when the Diocese did not give notice that the 10 years to develop a church had elapsed. The right to purchase crystalized at the time, independently of any notice. Indeed, whether it was Imasco or Genstar, no notice was needed to inform either of the passage of 10 years.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(b)</EM></N><TI><EM>Property Value in 1998</EM></TI>
<P>18. Genstar's witness John Koke (&ldquo;<BOLD>Koke</BOLD>&rdquo;) proclaims circumstances existing in 1998, which made the sale of the Property to the Diocese a sale at less than market value.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit (defined below), paras 8&ndash;13, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 28-29; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 3-4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, Koke was not with Imasco or Genstar in 1998. Koke only joined Genstar in September 2010. He was never with Imasco.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, para 1, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, p. 26; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Koke professes significant experience in the land development industry; but he does not suggest any particular qualifications as an appraiser of land value.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, para 1, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, p. 26; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Although uninformed by experience or qualification, Koke asserts that the sale of two neighbouring properties in Oakville inform the market value of the Property in 1998. However, those sales, one and two years afterwards, respectively, were upon different terms for lands zoned differently, as shown in Schedule &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and are not good comparables.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, paras 10-11, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 28-29; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 3-4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. Although exhibited to his affidavit, Koke's evidence also omits reference to the Affidavit of Residence and of Value of Consideration attached to the 1998 Transfer which notes the &ldquo;[moneys] paid or to be paid in cash&rdquo; is $576,000.00. The affidavit cites no undervalued consideration. To the contrary, it sets out that the &ldquo;VALUE OF LAND, BUILDING FIXTURES AND GOODWILL SUBJECT TO LAND TRANSFER TAX&rdquo; is $576,000.00.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Emphasis in original; Affidavit of Residence and of Value of the Consideration, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 6, p. 44; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>24. In any event, in the ensuing 15 years (plus) from the closing of the Sale Contract to April 2016, no one at Imasco or anyone else kept the Diocese apprised of the disposition and purported transfers of the Option. Koke's February 10, 2017 affidavit (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Koke Affidavit</BOLD>&rdquo;) for Genstar describes the complex corporate steps at Imasco, and subsequently, respecting Imasco's assets:
<QUOTE><P>35. As stated at paragraph 2 of my Affidavit, <BOLD>Genstar [Partnership] is Imasco's successor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke's characterization of a succession is incorrect. In fact, in his affidavit, Koke proceeds to discuss what would be assignments of the Option, as opposed to any succession.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In 1998, Imasco was a North American conglomerate which carried on business in Canada and elsewhere under various trade names including Genstar Development Company. In late 1999 and early 2000, Imasco transferred various assets, including the transfer of assets from Imasco to Genstar in early 2000.</BOLD></P>
<P>36. <BOLD>On or about February 1, 2000, Imasco and Genstar Development Company Limited (GDCL),</BOLD> a corporation governed by the laws of Canada, <BOLD>entered into a Transfer Agreement pursuant to which Imasco transferred all of the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;, as defined in the Transfer Agreement, to GDCL. Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts.</BOLD> Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo; is a copy of the February 1, 2000 Transfer Agreement <BOLD><UNDER>without the schedules which have been omitted due to volume</UNDER>.</BOLD></P>
<P>37. <BOLD>On or about January 15, 2001, Genstar Development Company (GDC), an unlimited liability corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Stephen G. Raby, pursuant to which GDC, as managing partner, and Mr. Raby, as initial partner, acknowledged and confirmed the formation of a general partnership under the Partnership Act of Alberta to carry on business under the name Genstar Development Partnership (as referred to herein as Genstar). Under the Memorandum of Agreement, the business of Genstar [Partnership] was stated to be the acquisition of the GDCL shares and assets and the winding up of GDCL,</BOLD> among other things. Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo; is a copy of the January 15, 2001 Partnership Agreement.</P>
<P>38. <BOLD>On January 15, 2001, GDCL entered into a Transfer Agreement with Genstar [Partnership], pursuant to which GDCL transferred to Genstar [Partnership] all of the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;, as defined in the Transfer Agreement.</BOLD> Attached as Exhibit &ldquo;V&rdquo; is a copy of the January 15, 2001 Transfer Agreement.</P>
<P>39. To summarize, the chain of ownership is as follows:
<P1>Imasco &darr; GDCL &darr; Genstar [Partnership]</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>As such, Genstar [Partnership] is the legal successor to Imasco's contracts including the Sale Agreement.</BOLD><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit, paras 35&ndash;39, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 34&ndash;36; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 9&ndash;11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke's characterization of a succession is incorrect. In fact, in his affidavit, Koke describes what would be assignments of the Option, as opposed to any succession.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added, bold and underlining.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. An affidavit of a law clerk of the appellant's counsel&mdash;provided eight months after the cross-examinations and just two weeks before the hearing&mdash;shows through a review of Exhibits &ldquo;D&rdquo; - &ldquo;E&rdquo; that Imasco Enterprises Inc. amalgamated on February 1, 2000 to form Imasco Limited (Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;) which further amalgamated, also on February 1, 2000, to form Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Catherine Ma sworn March 29, 2018, paras 6-7 and Exhibits D-E, Respondent's Compendium, Tabs 26&ndash;28, pp. 299&ndash;308; Exhibit Book, Tab 5, pp. 445-446 and 461&ndash;468.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appellant figures in none of those successions. Genstar asserts a novel theory of dual successions (i.e. to Imperial Tobacco and to itself), out of a unitary entity.</P>
<P>26. On the question of notice of the purported assignments (addressed further below), it is evident that the Diocese could not have followed the above-noted private transactions through Nova Scotia and Alberta to discover Genstar, which Koke asserts is Imasco's &ldquo;successor&rdquo;.</P>
<P>27. On the other hand, Imasco or Genstar, could easily have found the Diocese, and provided notice of assignment. Neither did so, in the more than 15 years from 2000/2001. Genstar's preemptive complaint of lack of notice by the Diocese concerning the Property's disposition seeks to reverse the actual equities.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(d)</EM></N><TI><EM>Is Genstar a Successor or a (Purported) Assignee?</EM></TI>
<P>28. While Koke claims that Genstar is the &ldquo;legal successor to Imasco's contracts&rdquo;, what Koke in fact describes in his affidavit, and what the 2000 and 2001 transfer agreements at Exhibits &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;V&rdquo; (collectively, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Transfer Agreements</BOLD>&rdquo;) to his affidavit demonstrate, is that, if anything, Genstar is a possible, indirect, assignee of assets of Imasco, but it is not Imasco's successor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sections 2.1 and 7.2, Transfer Agreement, February 1, 2000, (the &ldquo;<BOLD>2000 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;), Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, pp. 53 and 59; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 108 and 114; sections 2.1 and 7.2, Transfer Agreement, January 15, 2001, (the &ldquo;<BOLD>2001 Transfer Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;), Respondent's Compendium, Tab 8, pp. 199 and 205; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 319 and 325.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. The Court of Appeal has emphasized the distinction between the concepts of succession and assignment:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>.... When used in reference to corporations, a &ldquo;successor&rdquo; generally denotes another corporation which, through merger, amalgamation or some other type of legal succession, assumes the burdens and becomes vested with the rights of the first corporation....</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>The word &ldquo;assign&rdquo; has, of course, a broader meaning. An &ldquo;assign&rdquo; is anyone to whom an assignment is made and presumably, but for the specific reference to &ldquo;successors&rdquo;, would include both individuals and corporations.</BOLD> As between mortgagors, an assignment would be an agreement between the original mortgagor and his purchaser by which the latter would assume the mortgage debt in exchange for valuable consideration.</P>
<P>The definition of &ldquo;successor&rdquo; and &ldquo;assign&rdquo; that Wilson J. used are taken from Black's Law Dictionary (see, e.g., 6th ed. (1990), at pp. 118 and 1431.) She used them to assist her in interpreting a section of the Saskatchewan Limitation of Civil Rights Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. L-16. I think that they also assist in construing the appellants' guarantee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Montreal Trust Co of Canada v Birmingham Lodge Ltd</SOC><YEAR>1995</YEAR><CITE>24 OR (3d) 97</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>125 DLR (4th) 193</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>Montreal Trust</EM>] at paras 12-13, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. In the result, Genstar is not a successor of Imasco. If anything, it is an (indirect) assignee, the consequence of which is discussed farther below.</P>
<P>31. In any event, as noted at the end of paragraph 36 of his affidavit (quoted and underlined above), Koke failed to provide the schedules to the Transfer Agreements that he purports to rely on to demonstrate that Genstar is a successor of Imasco. Importantly, the schedules included the list of assets said to be excluded from the transfer to Genstar.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 1.2, 2000 Transfer Agreement, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, p. 52; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 107.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The application judge rightly concluded that, absent those schedules, it was not possible to determine whether Genstar was the successor of Imasco or its equitable assignee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at paras 34&ndash;39, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, pp. 7-8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is apparent from the Decision that the application judge was not satisfied that Koke's sole, unsubstantiated statement that &ldquo;the Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit, para 36, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 34-35; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 9-10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> was sufficient to establish that Genstar received the benefit of the Option.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at paras 28 and 34&ndash;39, Tab 1, pp. 5&ndash;8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This finding is particularly reasonable given the surprising omission of such a relevant schedule.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(e)</EM></N><TI><EM>Knowledge of Status of the Property</EM></TI>
<P>33. Genstar prefers to focus only on events in the Spring of 2016. However, the events in 2000/2001, described above, and from the Fall of 2008, described below, bear on the matters at issue, i.e. notice and delay, respectively.</P>
<P>34. The recitals to the 2000 Transfer Agreement declare Imasco carried on the &ldquo;business of acquiring, developing and selling real estate.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2000 Transfer Agreement, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, pp. 47-48; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 102-103.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. At the time, Imasco held a significant number of interests in lands in eastern and southern Ontario, and Oakville in particular.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>2000 Transfer Agreement, Schedule 1.1(A), Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, pp. 61&ndash;193; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 116&ndash;248.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. According to Koke, Genstar also &ldquo;carries on the business of acquiring, developing and selling real estate&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit, para 2, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, p. 27; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. Koke professed to know, albeit without any foundation, proof or production thereof, the municipal planning rules in Oakville from 1998 onwards including for the West Oak Trails Community, where the Property is situate in Oakville.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, paras 8&ndash;13, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 28-29; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 3-4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. However, Koke did not start with Genstar until September 2010, and nothing in his background suggests any knowledge of Oakville's municipal planning rules from 1998. His evidence on those rules is inadmissible.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, para 1, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, p. 26; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Nonetheless, Koke's affidavit demonstrates that Genstar is a sophisticated real estate development business, with the resources and ability to ascertain the status of its assets.</P>
<P>40. Despite this, neither Koke nor anyone else for Genstar, explains why Genstar did not act on the Option in September 2008 when it would have been clear that 10 years had elapsed and the Property was &ldquo;not developed for a church&rdquo;, in the wording of the Option. Certainly Koke does not depose that he or anyone else at Genstar had forgotten about the Option (unlike the Diocese which acknowledges that it had forgotten about the Option).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Cross-examination of James Long, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 2, p. 13; Exhibit Book, Tab 8, pp. 524, q. 55, lines 14&ndash;23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. Koke would know if the Option was or was not forgotten. He describes his role at Genstar as being &ldquo;responsible for overseeing all of Genstar Development Company's [the managing partner of Genstar] operations in Ontario, including financial projections, development approvals, lot and block sales, land acquisition and dispositions.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit, para 1, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, p. 26; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, p. 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. Despite his extensive role, Koke offers no explanation as to why Genstar from August 31, 2008, or why he from September 2010, did not act on the Option. Certainly the effect of this inaction is that the Diocese bore the carrying costs of the Property in the meantime, to its prejudice.</P>
<P>43. To explain Genstar's inaction at the time, he does set out Genstar's information on the Property in 2008 disclosing the &ldquo;subdivision where the Church Block was located, known as Westmount, had been fully developed and sold off by 2008.&rdquo; Ironically, Genstar offers this up as evidence of the Property's uniqueness (which it is not),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See paragraph 51 of Genstar's factum.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> by-passing the issue of delay in exercising the equitable remedy of specific performance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke Affidavit, para 15, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 5, pp. 29-30; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 4-5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. In any event, to explain Genstar's lead-footed conduct, Koke proceeds with some convoluted thoughts, explaining that &ldquo;[as] a result, prior to becoming aware of the contemplated sale by the Diocese of the Church Block in April 2016, neither I nor anyone else at Genstar [Partnership] that I am aware of,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Koke does not say who he asked at Genstar, or even if he asked anyone.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> knew that the Church Block had remained undeveloped.&rdquo; The problem with Koke's explanation is that he does not deal with the passage of the 10 year Triggering Event, which required nothing more than a calendar and a drive-by to determine.</P>
<P>45. A church is commonly known as a building used for public Christian worship. It is implausible and not credible that Genstar did not know that there was <EM>not</EM> a church building on the Property as of August 2008, given the professed knowledge of the Oakville subdivision. Genstar simply did not act, but does not explain why. Delay defeats equities.</P>
<P>46. The Court of Appeal has confirmed that where there is no outside date or time specified for the exercise of an option (as is the case here), a reasonable time limit for the option's exercise is implied. In <EM>Di Millo</EM>, it was found that the option in question had been exercised by the appellant in a reasonable time, being one and a half years after it became exercisable. In this case, Genstar <EM>purported</EM> to exercise the Option nearly eight years after it would have been exercisable. This delay is clearly not reasonable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Di Millo v 2099232 Ontario Inc</SOC><CITE>2018 ONCA 1051</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Di Millo</EM>] at paras 5, 10, 38 &amp; 41, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>

<P>47. In the face of Genstar's silence and delay, nearly fifteen years passed from the purported assignments, and nearly eight years from the deadline in the Option for the non-development of the Property for a church. Then, on or about February 18, 2016, James Long (&ldquo;<BOLD>Long</BOLD>&rdquo;), on behalf of the Diocese, publicly circulated a Request for Proposal (&ldquo;<BOLD>RFP</BOLD>&rdquo;) regarding the Property.

Under the RFP, the Diocese was under no obligation to accept any offers, and it had only remembered the Option when Koke telephoned Long, concerning a potential interest in the Property.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 3, p. 15; Exhibit Book, Tab 8A, p. 538.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. There is no disagreement that the Diocese did not notify Imasco before issuing the RFP; however, it is clear that no sale of the Property proceeded as a result of this innocent error by the Diocese. No prejudice to Genstar was occasioned.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(g)</EM></N><TI><EM>Genstar's Complaint Re Lack of Notice</EM></TI>
<P>50. Despite the evidence above, Genstar complains of a lack of notice by the Diocese of the Triggering Events in the Option. However, Genstar's submission is to be juxtaposed with the relief it now seeks, which is to <EM>enforce</EM> purported rights under the Option, regardless of the issue of notice.</P>
<P>51. As can be seen from the Transfer Agreements, two purported assignments of the Option took place: (a) the first in or about February 2000 from Imasco to Genstar Limited (the &ldquo;<BOLD>First Assignment</BOLD>&rdquo;); and (b) the second in or about January 2001 from Genstar Limited to Genstar (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Assignment</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sections 2.1 and 7.2. 2000 Transfer Agreement, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, pp. 53 and 59; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 108 and 114; sections 2.1 and 7.2, 2001 Transfer Agreement, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 8, pp. 199 and 208; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 319 and 325.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. In order for Genstar to enforce the purported First and Second Assignments of the Option as against the Diocese, notice of the assignments had to be given to the Diocese, as required by section 53(1) of the <EM>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c C.34, Factum of the Respondent, Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. None of Imasco, Genstar Limited or the appellant gave any notice to the Diocese of the First Assignment. As for the Second Assignment, it is also disputed that due notice was given. It is a safe inference that in 2000 and 2001, the parties had the relevant schedules to the Transfer Agreements, and that notice of assignment was not given to the Diocese because of the content of those schedules (i.e. because the Property was an excluded asset). In any event, as discussed below, confusing and contradictory documents were issued to the Diocese by Genstar and apparently related entities, commencing in April 2016.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(h)</EM></N><TI><EM>Genstar Asserts it is a Successor</EM></TI>
<P>54. By letter dated April 14, 2016, a law firm, Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP, wrote to the Diocese enclosing a notice under the <EM>Land Titles Act</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Section 71 Notice</BOLD>&rdquo;), registered that day on title to the Property. The registrant was not Genstar but &ldquo;Genstar Titleco Limited&rdquo;. Koke was one of the authorized signing officers on the Section 71 Notice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>April 14, 2016 Letter and Section 71 Notice, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 9, pp. 211&ndash;218; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 45&ndash;52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. The Section 71 Notice states that &ldquo;Genstar Titleco Limited is registering this [Section 71] Notice on behalf of <BOLD>Imasco Enterprises Inc. and its successors</BOLD>&rdquo;. [Emphasis added.] The letter itself is copied to Koke at &ldquo;Genstar Titleco Limited&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;Genstar [is] Imasco's successor&rdquo;. The reference to &ldquo;Genstar&rdquo; is presumably to Genstar Titleco Limited, the only Genstar entity referenced therein. The letter and the Section 71 Notice do not constitute notice of an assignment of the Option by Imasco to Genstar Limited, or by Genstar Limited to Gensta and indeed are to the contrary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 9, pp. 211&ndash;218; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 45&ndash;52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. On May 2, 2016, Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP again wrote to the Diocese, attaching a caution that had been registered on title to the Property on April 28, 2016 (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Caution</BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 2, 2016 Letter and Caution, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 10, pp. 219&ndash;223; Exhibit Book, Tab 1,pp. 53&ndash;58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>57. This time Koke asserts in the Caution that another entity, Genstar by its managing partner, Genstar Development Company, was registering the Caution because the &ldquo;nature of the interest is that the applicant [i.e. Genstar] has a proprietary interest in the land pursuant to the [Sale Contract] executed by the applicant's <BOLD>predecessor,</BOLD> Imasco Enterprises Inc...&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 10, pp. 219&ndash;223; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 53&ndash;58.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Emphasis added.] Again, no notice is given of the First Assignment, and the letter and Caution are hardly notice of the Second Assignment. Instead, the Caution asserts that Genstar's rights arise because Imasco is a predecessor&mdash;which it is not.</P>
<P>58. After May 2, 2016, Genstar Titleco Limited is dropped from the correspondence; however, things become no more clear. By letter dated May 24, 2016, Joseph &amp; O' Donohue LLP wrote again to the Diocese attaching a draft transfer describing Genstar as a company. Normally this would only be a technical issue, but not in these circumstances. In any event, no reference to any assignment is made.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 24, 2016 Letter and Draft Transfer, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 11, pp. 224&ndash;229; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 59&ndash;64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. On May 26, 2016, the Diocese responds by its lawyers Carters Professional Corporation. Disagreement ensues between the parties' lawyers as to whether the Triggering Events have occurred, which unfolds in the correspondence that follows. Ultimately, these are questions of law or mixed fact and law for this court to determine, regardless of the lawyers' positions<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 26, 2016 Letter from N. Claridge to P. O'Donoghue, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 12, pp. 230-231; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 65-66.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP replies the same day, disagreeing over the Triggering Events, and their impact. Of more importance, no correction is made to the position that Genstar was a successor of Imasco, as opposed to an assignee.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 26, 2016 Letter P. O'Donoghue to N. Claridge, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 13, pp. 232&ndash;235; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 67&ndash;70.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On May 30, 2016, the Diocese's lawyer writes to the lawyer for Genstar that the Diocese &ldquo;does not recognize the validity of the right to repurchase...&rdquo;. At that date, there had been no notice of the assignments, only the assertion of a succession. Also, nearly eight years had passed from the August 31, 2008 Triggering Event.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 30, 2016 Letter, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 14, pp. 236-237; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 76-77.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. By letter dated May 31, 2016, Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP reiterates that Genstar is &ldquo;Imasco's successor&rdquo;, and they tender closing documents which, among other things, have the incorrect Purchase Price and misdescribe the transferee for registration purposes. The former issue, the price, is a material matter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>May 31, 2016 Letter and Documents, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 15, pp. 238&ndash;240; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 78&ndash;80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By letter dated June 3, 2016, the Diocese's lawyers reply to the May 31, 2016 letter and to an attempted tender that day by Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP. At the time, Genstar is maintaining that it was still a successor of Imasco.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>June 3, 2016 Letter, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 16, pp. 241-242; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 81-82.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. Joseph &amp; O'Donoghue LLP proceeds to correct a number of deficiencies in the documents they had tendered previously and, by letter dated June 16, 2016, they tendered revised closing documents correcting, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the name of the transferee for registration purposes. As with all prior correspondence, no notice is given of any assignment, or correction made to the assertion that Genstar is Imasco's successor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>June 16, 2016 Letter, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 17, pp. 243&ndash;248; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 83&ndash;88.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On June 22, 2016, the Diocese's lawyers reply reiterating that the Diocese &ldquo;does not recognize the validity of your client's rights to repurchase...&rdquo;. Whether or not known, that position was fair in view of the factors noted above.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>June 22, 2016 Letter, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 18, pp. 249-250; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 89-90.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. The correspondence ends on June 28, 2016, with Genstar's lawyers repeating the assertion that Genstar is Imasco's successor. That statement is never retracted or corrected, and no notice is given of any assignments. Thereafter, the 90-day period for paying for the Purchase Price expires, and the only amount tendered was substantially short of the Purchase Price, by more than $20,000.00.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>June 28, 2016 Letter and Documents, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 25, pp. 279&ndash;297; Exhibit Book, Tab 3, pp. 370&mdash;388; Long Affidavit, paras 11-15 and 17, and Exhibits B-F, Respondent's Compendium, Tabs 20&ndash;25, pp. 257&ndash;297; Exhibit Book, Tab 3, pp. 339&ndash;341 and 351&ndash;388.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Deficient Tender</EM></TI>
<P>64. Even if due notice of the assignments had been given, the attempts by Genstar to exercise the Option on each attempt at tender (which requirement was never waived by the Diocese) during the 90-day timeframe set out in the Option was deficient, as the correspondence between legal counsel for the parties confirms. There was not, however, any anticipatory breach, as Genstar maintains. Moreover, even if there were an anticipatory breach (which is denied) Genstar elected not to accept that purported breach. Instead, Genstar proceeded to attempt a tender.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Long Affidavit, paras 11&ndash;15 and 17, and Exhibits B-F, Respondent's Compendium, Tabs 20&ndash;25, pp. 257&ndash;297; Exhibit Book, Tab 3, pp. 339&ndash;341 and 351&ndash;388.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. In every attempt at tender, Genstar incorrectly calculated the Purchase Price, and did not use the Ontario Consumer Price Index. Legal counsel, on behalf of the Diocese, communicated a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies in her correspondence with respect to the tenders. Only after the time period for exercise of the Option had elapsed, and after the Diocese had submitted its responding affidavit in the application, did Genstar indicate one year later in June <BOLD>2017</BOLD> that it was willing to purchase the Property for the correct amount.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Long Affidavit, paras 11, 12, 15, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 20, pp. 257-258; Exhibit Book, Tab 3, pp. 339-340; Reply Affidavit of John Koke, sworn June 8, 2017, para 4, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 19, p. 252; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 3.33; Cross-Examination of John Koke, June 15, 2017, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 4, pp. 23&ndash;25; Exhibit Book, Tab 9, pp. 557&ndash;559, qq. 18&ndash;20, lines 6 (p. 557) - 14 (p. 559).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES AND LAW</TI>
<P>66. The issues that Genstar raises on appeal are as follows:
<P1>(a) Did the application judge err in finding that Genstar is not the successor of Imasco?</P1>
<P1>(b) Did the application judge err in finding that Genstar is not an &ldquo;equitable assignee&rdquo; of the Option?</P1>
<P1>(c) Did the application judge err by declining Genstar's request to adduce new evidence once the hearing of the application had begun?</P1>
<P1>(d) Did the application judge err in finding that Genstar's tender was deficient?</P1></P>
<P>67. The Diocese submits that if Genstar is successful in the above grounds, the following issue must be decided: Is Genstar entitled to the remedy of specific performance?</P>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(a)</EM></N><TI><EM>Standard of Review</EM></TI>
<P>68. In its factum, Genstar begins by stating that the standard of review on a question of law is correctness. However, Genstar has not raised <EM>any</EM> ground of appeal that is a pure question of law. To the contrary, the grounds of appeals raised by Genstar stem from findings of fact.</P>
<P>69. The application judge found as matters of fact on the substantive issues that:
<P1>(a) Genstar's evidentiary record contained incomplete documents that made it impossible for the trier of fact to find that Genstar was either a successor or equitable assignee in the circumstances;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at paras 34 and 39, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, pp. 7-8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(b) without having proved its status as either a successor or equitable assignee, Genstar did not prove that it had the right to exercise the Option pursuant to the agreement;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 40, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>(c) the evidence relied on by Genstar failed to establish that the Diocese had committed an anticipatory breach of the Option, when that evidence <BOLD><EM>was considered in the context of numerous communications between the parties</EM></BOLD>;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 42, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>(d) Genstar calculated the wrong purchase price by a not insignificant amount and it did not advise the Diocese that it was willing to pay the correct Purchase Price until after this application was commenced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 43, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>70. Each of these findings of fact ought to be afforded deference. They should only be overturned if they are proven to be &ldquo;clearly wrong&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsupported by the evidence&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Heritage Capital Corp v Equitable Trust Co</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 19</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Appellant (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appellant's Authorities</BOLD>&rdquo;), Tab 5; <CASEREF><SOC>HL v Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 25</CITE><PARANUM>55-56</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>71. Similarly, to the extent that the issues on appeal consist of mixed fact and law, such as whether strict compliance with the Option is one of its requirements, the record must be reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE><PARANUM>36</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 6; <CASEREF><SOC>Airia Brands Inc v Air Canada</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 792</CITE><PARANUM>39</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. Finally, a discretionary decision (in the present case, the decision not to permit Genstar to submit new evidence after the hearing of its application) will only be overturned in limited circumstances, including where it is so clearly wrong that it amounts to an injustice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Penner v Niagara Regional Police Service Board</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 19</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Penner</EM>] at para 27, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That is not the case here.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(b)</EM></N><TI><EM>Genstar is Not Imasco's Successor</EM></TI>
<P>73. At paragraph 43 of its factum, Genstar accurately states that the application judge identified the correct legal test for corporate successorship. Specifically, Her Honour referred to <CASEREF><SOC>National Trust Co. v. Mead</SOC></CASEREF> wherein the Supreme Court of Canada held that the term &ldquo;successor&rdquo; &ldquo;generally denotes another corporation which, through merger, amalgamation or some other type of legal succession, assumes the burdens and becomes vested with the rights of the first corporation.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 30, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 7; <CASEREF><SOC>National Trust Co v Mead</SOC><CITE>[1990] 2 SCR 410</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>71 DLR (4th) 488</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Mead</EM>] at para 27, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This test is settled law and was applied without controversy in two other cases that were before the application judge: <CASEREF><SOC>Pillar Securitisation S.A.R.L. v. Sinha Estate (Trustee of)</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Birmingham Lodge Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Pillar Securitisation SARL v Sinha Estate (Trustee of)</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 355</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Pillar Securitisation</EM>] at paras 7 &amp; 16, Appellant's Authorities. Tab 14; <EM>Montreal Trust</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 12&ndash;14, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. Accordingly, the application judge's finding that Genstar is not Imasco's successor can only be overturned if this court finds a palpable and overriding error in the lower court's application of the correctly identified legal test to the facts of this case. No such error exists. Genstar had the burden of proving that it is a successor to Imasco.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>FH v McDougall</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It failed to discharge that burden, including because it failed to tender the evidence required to do so.</P>
<P>75. Genstar's evidence is summarized in the Decision and at paragraph 24 (above).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 28, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, pp. 5-6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is clear that the transfer of assets to Genstar Development Company Limited, and eventually to Genstar, was not of all the assets. &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo; is a defined term in the Transfer Agreements and its content could only be known by examining the entire agreement, including its schedules. One of the schedules that Genstar chose to exclude from the record is a schedule that expressly describes &ldquo;Excluded Assets&rdquo;, being a list of those assets excluded from the 2000 Transfer Agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Sections 1.2 &amp; 2.2, 2000 Transfer Agreement, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 7, pp. 52-53; Exhibit Book, Tab 1, pp. 107-108.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>76. At paragraph 52 of its factum, Genstar states that the overriding concern is to determine &ldquo;the intent of the parties and the scope of their understanding&rdquo;, and goes onto correctly note that the court must read the contract <BOLD>as a whole.</BOLD> What Genstar ignores is the fact that the application judge did not have the whole contract because Genstar chose to omit it.</P>
<P>77. In <CASEREF><SOC>Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that when interpreting a contract, &ldquo;one should examine the contract as a whole with a view to searching for the intention of the parties by recognizing the natural meaning that flows from the language chosen.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd v Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1997] 3 SCR 1210</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>153 DLR (4th) 385</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> at para 118, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The foregoing is impossible in this case, where the whole contract is not available to the court to interpret, and material parts are omitted.</P>
<P>78. At paragraph 56 of its factum, Genstar relies on <EM>Pillar Securitisation</EM> for the proposition that an entity may be found to be a successor even in circumstances where not <EM>all</EM> of the predecessor's assets are assumed. <EM>Pillar Securitisation</EM> is very different from the present case. The entity in that case was found to be a successor because it had assumed the assets and obligations of its predecessor following the &ldquo;demerger&rdquo; of the predecessor entity, pursuant to a Luxemburg receivership court order. In so finding, Justice Eidsvik relied on the passage from the <EM>Mead</EM> decision, which is quoted above, with particular emphasis on the words &ldquo;through merger, amalgamation or some other type of legal succession&rdquo;. Justice Eidsvik held that the Luxemburg receivership court order &ldquo;demerging&rdquo; the predecessor entity amounted to a &ldquo;merger&rdquo; or &ldquo;some other type of legal succession.&rdquo; In the present case, Genstar did not obtain the Option by merger, amalgamation, or any other type of legal succession.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Pillar Securitisation</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 16 &amp; 19, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. It is untenable for Genstar to assert that there is any error (let alone a palpable and overriding error) in finding that it was not possible to conclude that Genstar is Imasco's successor in the face of a materially deficient record, of Genstar's choosing.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(c)</EM></N><TI><EM>Genstar is not an Equitable Assignee</EM></TI>
<P>80. The lack of evidence described above was also fatal to Genstar's allegation that it was an equitable assignee of the Option.</P>
<P>81. In order to find an equitable assignment, the court must find that the &ldquo;form [of assignment] used clearly show[s] an intention that the assignee is to have the benefit of the debt or chose in action.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Nadeau v Caparelli</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 730</CITE><PARANUM>6 &amp; 19</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Genstar relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Nadeau v. Caparelli</SOC></CASEREF> in support of its assertion that it received an equitable assignment of the Option. However, in <EM>Nadeau</EM> the court was able to find equitable assignment with the help of the documents evidencing the assignment, and the Court of Appeal deferred to that finding.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 3, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such a conclusion was not possible in the present case, because of the deficient evidentiary record put forward by Genstar.</P>
<P>82. The application judge correctly concluded that &ldquo;without such relevant documentation, it is not possible for the court to properly consider whether the corporate documents relied on support a finding of an equitable assignment of the [Option].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 38, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>83. Furthermore, in <EM>Nadeau</EM>, the party found to be an equitable assignee was the sole director, officer, and shareholder of the assignor (roles that he shared with his wife before her death) and that the obligor would have been aware of the involvement of the equitable assignee in the assignor's business. In the present case, as the Diocese was not aware of the complicated relationship between Imasco and Genstar, it could not have been aware of any purported assignment among them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Nadeau v Caparelli</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 5, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>84. At paragraph 67 of its factum, Genstar refers to &ldquo;uncontested evidence on the record establishing that &ldquo;[i]n late 1999 and early 2000, Imasco transfers <BOLD>various assets,</BOLD> including the transfer of assets from Imasco to Genstar in 2000&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transferred Assets included Imasco's real estate contracts&rdquo;. [Emphasis added.] Genstar omits that its own evidence supports the conclusion that the transfer from Imasco was not unlimited. The transfer included &ldquo;various&rdquo; assets, not all assets. The only way to determine which assets were included and which were not, is to review the entire 2000 Transfer Agreement, which was not available to the court because Genstar chose not to provide it.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(d)</EM></N><TI><EM>The assignor of the Option ought to have been joined</EM></TI>
<P>85. The appellant seeks to excuse its failure to comply with rule 5.03(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure (concerning the joinder of the assignor in an action by an assignee) by relying on two cases, <CASEREF><SOC>Landmark Vehicle Leasing Corp. v. Mister Twister Inc.</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Gentra Canada Investments Inc. v. Lipson</SOC></CASEREF>, which contain the propositions that the court may grant relief from the joinder requirement set out in rule 5.03(3) where the debtor is not prejudiced by the lack of joinder or where the assignor had &ldquo;no interest in the chose and had ceased to exist&rdquo;, respectively.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Landmark Vehicle Leasing Corp v Mister Twister Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 ONCA 545</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Landmark</EM>] at para 14, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 8; <CASEREF><SOC>Gentra Canada Investments Inc v Lipson</SOC><CITE>2011 ONCA 331</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Gentra</EM>] at para 62, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>86. Neither case relied on by Genstar is analogous to the present case. In <EM>Landmark</EM>, the debtor received actual notice of the assignment and, thus, no prejudice was found.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Landmark</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 15, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Gentra</EM>, any liability of the obligor to the assignor was statute barred and, therefore, the assignor had no interest in the chose in action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gentra</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 63, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Furthermore, the effectiveness of the assignments were not in dispute in either of these cases. The foregoing is clearly distinguishable from the present case, wherein the Diocese did not receive written or actual notice of the purported assignment of the Option. Also, without the joinder of the assignor, neither the court nor the Diocese is able to assess the veracity of Genstar's assertion at paragraph 70 of its factum that &ldquo;Imasco and GDCL are not active entities and could not possibly assert an interest in the Repurchase Option.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(e)</EM></N><TI><EM>Exercise of Discretion</EM></TI>
<P>87. At the outset of the hearing of the application, the parties were asked by the application judge to address whether an application was appropriate to resolve the issues in dispute. Genstar submitted that an application was appropriate.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 8, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>88. Genstar urged the application judge to proceed with the application on the basis of the evidence in the application record, but asked that it be permitted to provide further evidence to support its position that it has the right to exercise the Option. The application judge rightly found that it would be improper to allow Genstar, after receiving comments and a ruling from the court, to introduce new evidence after the completion of the hearing.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 24, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 4-5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>89. Importantly, as noted by the application judge, Genstar did not request an adjournment to provide the court with the necessary documents or to provide additional evidence on the issue.</P>
<P>90. Despite this, Genstar now complains that the application judge did not exercise her discretion and permit Genstar to <EM>attempt</EM> to shore up its incomplete evidentiary record by ordering a trial of the issue. As Justice Spies warned in <CASEREF><SOC>Lo v. Ho</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>...counsel cannot and should not assume that the court will be receptive to reopening a trial to hear evidence that they decided not to call or mistakenly forgot to lead. There are no exceptional circumstances or any concerns that dismissing the motion will result in a miscarriage of justice that would warrant relaxing the &ldquo;due diligence requirement&rdquo; in this case. To the contrary, if counsel could obtain an order reopening a trial in these circumstances, in my view, that would amount to abuse of the court's process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lo v Ho</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 40. Respondent's Authorities, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>91. At paragraph 63 of its factum, Genstar relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Yip v Deng</SOC></CASEREF>, in which Justice Dunphy exercised his discretion to order a short hearing to resolve an issue that could not be resolved using the existing record. <CASEREF><SOC>Yip v Deng</SOC></CASEREF> is very different from the present case. In <EM>Yip</EM>, the evidentiary record contained contradictions, as well as gaps, that precluded Justice Dunphy from confidently proceeding on the existing record.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Yip v Deng</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 5834</CITE><PARANUM>6&ndash;8</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the present case, the application judge was simply not given evidence on certain matters; she was nonetheless able to proceed on the record before her.</P>
<P>92. The application judge's discretion not to order a trial of the issue was fair and just in the circumstances. In any event, it was squarely within her discretion not to order a trial and her decision, being discretionary, should be afforded significant deference. Justices Cromwell and Karakatsanis, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Penner</EM>, succinctly described when a discretionary decision of a lower court can be reversed on appeal. They stated:
<QUOTE><P>...[a] discretionary decision of a lower court will be reversible where that court misdirected itself or came to a decision that is so clearly wrong that it amounts to an injustice: <CASEREF><SOC>Elsom v. Elsom</SOC><CITE>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1367</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at p. 1375. Reversing a lower court's discretionary decision is also appropriate where the lower court gives no or insufficient weight to relevant considerations: <CASEREF><SOC>Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport)</SOC><CITE>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 3</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, at pp. 76-77.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Penner</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, at para 27, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(f)</EM></N><TI><EM>Genstar's Deficient Tender</EM></TI>
<P>93. The application judge correctly found that Genstar failed to properly tender and instead sought to exercise the Option for a purchase price that was more than $20,000.00 less than the Purchase Price that was due. Genstar now seeks to avoid the consequences of its actions, by claiming that: a) it did not need to tender because of an alleged anticipatory breach by the Diocese; or b) its tender was sufficient because so-called &ldquo;strict compliance&rdquo; with the Option was unnecessary. Neither conclusion is supported by the evidence, at law, or otherwise.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Was there an anticipatory breach?</EM></TI>
<P>94. Despite using the term &ldquo;anticipatory breach&rdquo;, Genstar is asserting that there was anticipatory repudiation on the part of the Diocese with respect to the Option.</P>
<P>95. The Supreme Court of Canada recently restated the test for anticipatory breach and anticipatory repudiation in <CASEREF><SOC>Potter v. New Brunswick (Legal Aid Services Commission)</SOC></CASEREF>. Justice Cromwell stated:
<QUOTE><P>An anticipatory breach &ldquo;occurs when one party manifests, through words or conduct, an intention not to perform or not to be bound by provisions of the agreement that require performance in the future&rdquo;: McCamus, at p. 689; see also A. Swan, with the assistance of J. Adamski, Canadian Contract Law (2nd ed. 2009), at &sect; 7.89. When the anticipated future non-observance relates to important terms of the contract or shows an intention not to be bound in the future, the anticipatory breach gives rise to anticipatory repudiation. The focus in such cases is on what the party's words and/or conduct say about future performance of the contract. For example, there will be an anticipatory repudiation if the words and conduct evince an intention to breach a term of the contract which, if actually breached, would constitute repudiation of the contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Potter v New Brunswick (Legal Aid Services Commission)</SOC><CITE>2015 SCC 10</CITE><PARANUM>149</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>96. While the <EM>Potter</EM> decision arose from a dispute in the employment context, the test for anticipatory repudiation is the same in the real property context.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Spirent Communications of Ottawa Ltd v Quake Technologies (Canada) Inc</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 92</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Spirent</EM>] at para 37, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>97. In the present case, the application judge found, as a matter of fact, that there had been no anticipatory breach by the Diocese.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision at para 42, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Importantly, the application judge considered the &ldquo;numerous email exchanges between the parties&rdquo; and determined, based on that factual matrix, that the statements relied on did not amount to an anticipatory breach.</P>
<P>98. The foregoing distinguishes the present case from each of the cases cited by Genstar, as well as this court's recent decision in <EM>Di Millo</EM>, in which the court concluded that the innocent party was relieved in the face of a clear and unequivocal refusal to close. In <EM>Di Millo</EM> the breaching party went so far as to invite the innocent party to commence a law suit. There was no similarly unequivocal moment in the present case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Di Millo</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>99. Furthermore, at no time did Genstar <EM>accept</EM> the alleged repudiation that it now seeks to rely upon. This is unlike the case in <EM>Di Millo</EM>, where the innocent party elected to rely on the anticipatory repudiation it faced, rather than tendering.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>100. In short, even if there was an anticipatory repudiation, it did not relieve Genstar of its duties under the Option (if it had any rights thereunder). Rather, in the face of an anticipatory repudiation, the innocent party is presented with an option to affirm or disaffirm the contract. Where the innocent party wishes to disaffirm the contract, its disaffirmation must be &ldquo;clearly and unequivocally communicated to the repudiating party within a reasonable time.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Brown v Belleville (City)</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 148</CITE><PARANUM>42&ndash;45</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Such a disaffirmation was evinced by the innocent party in <EM>Di Millo</EM> and also in <CASEREF><SOC>Spirent Communications of Ottawa Ltd. v. Quake Technologies (Canada) Inc.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spirent</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 53 &amp; 55, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 7; <EM>Di Millo</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 50, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>101. If Genstar is correct in its position that it faced an anticipatory repudiation (which is denied), then it had the choice of electing to accept the repudiation of the Option or proceed with the agreement, and itself abide by its terms.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>RPM Investments Corp v Lange</SOC><CITE>2017 ABQB 305</CITE><PARANUM>55&ndash;65</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Genstar chose to proceed. As part of doing so, Genstar was compelled to honour the Option, including as to payment of the full Purchase Price. In these circumstances, the question of anticipatory repudiation by the Diocese is irrelevant.</P>
<P>102. This principle has been directly incorporated into the law of options, which would identify the notification issue as a &ldquo;spent breach&rdquo;, given the election of Genstar.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sail Labrador v Challenge One (The)</SOC><CITE>[1999] 1 SCR 265</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>169 DLR (4th) 1</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Sail Labrador</EM>] at paras 68&ndash;70, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Did Genstar fulfil its duties to properly tender?</EM></TI>
<P>103. Having elected to proceed under the Option, Genstar was obliged to comply with its terms. <EM>If</EM> Genstar had the right to call on the Option, then by its terms, Genstar's <EM>only</EM> obligation was to tender the full amount of the Purchase Price, on time. It failed to do so.</P>
<P>104. At paragraph 77 of its factum, Genstar asserts that it was not required to meet a standard of &ldquo;strict compliance&rdquo; and states instead that only substantial compliance with the Option was required.</P>
<P>105. However, the term of the Option that Genstar requests relief from (the Purchase Price) was a central term of the Option. The Purchase Price, by its nature, was of significant importance. A failure to tender the entire Purchase Price was a substantial and material defect.</P>
<P>106. The cases relied upon by Genstar to suggest that it was entitled to tender less than the Purchase Price, involve slight shortfalls (nowhere near $20,000) or sale contracts with clearly distinguishable terms. At paragraph 79 of its factum, Genstar relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Leung v. Leung</SOC></CASEREF> for the proposition that a vendor owes a &ldquo;duty of flexibility&rdquo; in cases involving &ldquo;minor omissions or defects&rdquo;. However, Genstar fails to note that in <EM>Leung</EM>, the purchaser tendered in accordance with that contract. <EM>Leung</EM> interprets a sale contract that contained no provisions as to the time, place or mode of tender. The purchaser's solicitor attended at the land registry office with a mortgage that contained a technical error making it unregistrable. The purchaser's solicitor advised that the document could be fixed within a few hours. The vendor's solicitor (acting with instructions) tendered his documents and advised that he would not accept tender of the corrected mortgage later that day. In those circumstances, the court found that the purchaser was entitled to tender at any time up to midnight, and that the vendor had breached the agreement by refusing to accept the corrected mortgage on the closing date.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Leung v Leung</SOC><YEAR>1990</YEAR><CITE>75 OR (2d) 786</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>14 RPR (2d) 214</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont Ct J (Gen Div)</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras 24, 37, &amp; 49, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>107. Importantly, the purchaser in <EM>Leung</EM> attempted to tender everything required by the sales contract.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 25, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That is entirely different from the present case, in which the purchaser <EM>never</EM> tendered the full Purchaser Price.</P>
<P>108. Similarly, at paragraph 81 of its factum, Genstar relies on <CASEREF><SOC>Syed v. McArthur</SOC></CASEREF> for the supposed proposition that a vendor &ldquo;cannot refuse to close as long as the purchase indicates a willingness to provide any additional amount owing&rdquo;. <EM>Syed</EM> does not stand for that proposition (nor has Genstar provided any authority that does).</P>
<P>109. In <EM>Syed</EM>, the purchaser under an agreement of purchase and sale was granted specific performance following failure by the vendor to close the transaction, and following a tender that was held to be valid by the court. The vendor unsuccessfully challenged the tender on the grounds that the amount of purchase money tendered was less than the required amount. The court did not accept the vendor's position regarding the amount tendered, holding that the slight deficiency in the amount was due to the purchaser's reference to a statement of adjustments that was 19 days old.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Syed v McArthur</SOC><YEAR>1984</YEAR><CITE>46 OR (2d) 593</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>24 ACWS (2d) 317</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont HCJ</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [<EM>Syed</EM>] at paras 28, &amp; 34, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>110. <EM>Syed</EM> is not analogous to the present case. The deficiency in the amounts tendered in <EM>Syed</EM> were not in the base purchase price, but were in the nature of adjustments. Put another way, the deficiency in <EM>Syed</EM> was not a result of an under-payment of the purchase price stipulated under the agreement, which, in this case, was an amount ascertainable in advance.</P>
<P>111. Importantly, the amount of the deficiency at issue in <EM>Syed</EM>, while not set out in the decision, was described as &ldquo;slight&rdquo;. Nothing is &ldquo;slight&rdquo; about a $20,000.00 shortfall.</P>
<P>112. Furthermore, where time is of the essence, strict performance with respect to matters of time is a requirement. In <CASEREF><SOC>Kennelly v. Hashemi</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a time is of the essence provision in an agreement of purchase of sale, holding that, &ldquo;the respondents ceased to be obligated to complete the purchase of the Property and were entitled to the return of their deposit when the appellant failed to complete the purchase and sale transaction at the Closing Time.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kennelly v Hashemi</SOC><CITE>2018 ONCA 558</CITE><PARANUM>10-11</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 11; <CASEREF><SOC>Domicile Developments Inc v MacTavish</SOC><YEAR>1999</YEAR><CITE>45 OR (3d) 302</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>175 DLR (4th) 334</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 10, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>113. Genstar never achieved the requisite tendering of the Purchase Price to complete the purchase of the Property. From the Diocese's perspective, the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; of the Option is the Purchase Price. Indeed, that is the only benefit of the Option to the Diocese. It is reasonable to conclude that the intent of the parties to the Option is that each party would strictly perform the fundamental terms thereof, which was to tender the entire Purchase Price. However, even if the court applies the substantial performance doctrine, Genstar's attempt to tender $20,000.00 less than it owned is a substantial failure to perform.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sail Labrador</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> para 50, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 10; <CASEREF><SOC>Lombard North Central PLC v Butterworth</SOC><YEAR>1987</YEAR><CITE>QB 527</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>114. An implied term requiring vendors to close and then to readjust for such shortfalls in the purchase price would create uncertainty and havoc in conveyancing, including by making vendors the involuntary creditors of their purchasers.</P>
<P>115. It is to be emphasized that nothing done or not done by the Diocese caused the shortfall in Genstar's tender. The Diocese was never under a duty to counsel Genstar on how to properly tender to purchase the Property pursuant to the Option. In addition, none of the correspondence between the legal counsel for the parties excuses non-performance of the contractual duties by Genstar to properly tender.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>(g)</EM></N><TI><EM>Specific Performance</EM></TI>
<P>116. If the appellant succeeds on the issues it raises on the appeal, it is submitted that nevertheless specific performance is not available to Genstar.</P>
<P>117. There is no sufficient evidence of uniqueness of the Property. The Property in question is an investment property to Genstar. In <CASEREF><SOC>2296608 Ontario Inc. v. DHMK Properties Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice O'Marra states that &ldquo;[e]ven on a uniquely good investment any loss of profits can be compensated for in damages.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Southcott Estates Inc v Toronto Catholic District School Board</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 51</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 14; <CASEREF><SOC>2296608 Ontario Inc v DHMK Properties Inc</SOC><CITE>2014 ONSC 2875</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>DHMK Properties</EM>] at paras 15&ndash;18, Respondent's Authorities, Tab 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>118. Genstar has not demonstrated that a replacement property is unavailable. To the contrary, a review of the lands surrounding the Property demonstrates that it is not unique. Attached as Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; are two aerial pictures, printed from the computer program &ldquo;Google Earth&rdquo;, which renders a 3D representation of earth based on satellite imagery and maps.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; is reproduced from the affidavit of Michelle Kent sworn April 11, 2019, para 2 and Exhibits A-B; Respondent's Compendium, Tab 29, pp. 309&ndash;313; Exhibit Book, Tab 7, pp. 504&ndash;508.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Schedule &ldquo;D&rdquo; shows that the neighbourhood surrounding the Property contains parcels of vacant land. It is apparent that the Property is not unique.</P>
<P>119. The application judge found that there was no requirement for Genstar to show uniqueness of the Property because of her finding that it was the &ldquo;intent of the parties that specific performance be awarded if the property was not developed for use as a church.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 51, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, neither the plain language nor any careful analysis of the Option reveals any such intention. The Option simply stipulates that the Vendor of the Property, Imasco, was entitled to repurchase the Property upon the non-occurrence of particular events for a particular time period and for a particular price. It does not speak to the parties' intentions as to the remedy in the event of a breach, and such intent alone does not make the Property unique.</P>
<P>120. The application judge referred to the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Kahlen v. Vogel Construction Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kahlen v Vogel Construction Ltd</SOC><CITE>[2006] OJ No 521</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>40 RPR (4th) 1</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont Sup Ct J</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 68, Appellant's Authorities, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> for the proposition that an option to repurchase lands did not require evidence that the lands were unique. However, in the <EM>Kahlen</EM> case, the court accepted the argument that &ldquo;the lot is unique to [the applicant] as it was previously owned by her and is the only remaining lot without a residence which is holding up completion of the subdivision and release of her obligations under the subdivision agreement&rdquo;. On that basis (and having regard for the contractual intent) the court in <EM>Kahlen</EM> found that the property was unique, and ordered specific performance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 68 and 86, Book of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The application judge erred at law in holding, contrary to the finding in <EM>Kahlen</EM>, that &ldquo;[there] is therefore no requirement for the Applicant to show specific uniqueness of the property&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Decision, para 51, Respondent's Compendium, Tab 1, p. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>121. In any event, even if the Option evinced an intention that it be specifically performed, specific performance is an equitable, and therefore discretionary, remedy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>DHMK Properties</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para 15, Book of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 15; <CASEREF><SOC>Horizon Custom Builders Ltd v Behrens</SOC><CITE>2001 MBCA 198</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Book of Authorities of the Respondent, Tab 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, even if the court takes account of such evidence of intent, it is not determinative in granting specific performance. The counter-vailing factors of delay (which was not considered at all) and lack of uniqueness of the Property clearly militate against such a remedy.</P>
<P>122. As a result, it is submitted that the application judge erred at law. It is requested that the court of Appeal make the decision that specific performance is not available to the appellant, pursuant to the Court's authority under section 134(1)(a) of the <EM>Court of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
