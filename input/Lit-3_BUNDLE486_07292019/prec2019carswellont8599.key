<BLOCK2><TI>The Parties</TI>
<P><P1>4. The Plaintiff, Andrew Rhinehart (&ldquo;Rhinehart&rdquo;), is an individual residing in West Palm Beach, Florida, USA. At all material times, he was an employee of the Defendants.</P1>
<P1>5. The Defendant, Legend 3D Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Legend 3D Canada&rdquo;), is a business incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario. Its head office is located in Toronto, Ontario. Legend 3D Inc. (&ldquo;Legend 3D&rdquo;) is a business incorporated pursuant to the laws of the United States. Both Defendants <UNDER>(the &ldquo;Corporate Defendants&rdquo;)</UNDER> are related entities that operate under common control in the digital media industry. At all material times, they were joint employers of Rhinehart.</P1>
<P1>6. The Defendant, Joseph Cashion (&ldquo;Cashion&rdquo;), is an individual residing in Toronto, Ontario. At all material times, he was a director of the Defendant, Legend 3D Canada.</P1>
<P1>7. The Defendant, Sarita Mandanna (&ldquo;Mandanna&rdquo;), is an individual residing in Toronto, Ontario. At all material times, she was a director of the Defendant, Legend 3D Canada.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>History of Employment and Dismissal</TI>
<P><P1>8. Rhinehart commenced employment with Legend 3D in September 2012 as a Compositor. In the years that followed, he worked in San Diego and then in Los Angeles in various capacities. While in Los Angeles, in the summer of 2016, Jeff Brownlee, Legend 3D's Vice President, Human Resources, contacted him to tell him that a Compositing Supervisor position had opened up at Legend 3D Canada in Toronto and that Legend 3D wanted him to fill the role.</P1>
<P1>9. Rhinehart, who had only lived in the United States, was intrigued by the offer but was concerned about moving to another country. He was enjoying his work with Legend 3D in the United States; and while living in the United States he was surrounded by friends, a girlfriend, and family. He needed to be confident that if he was to go through the inconvenience of moving to Toronto, it would be on the basis that Legend 3D's offer was a serious one and the job relatively secure.</P1>
<P1>10. In subsequent discussions with Brownlee, Brownlee informed Rhinehart that Legend 3D would want him to commit to working in Toronto for at least one year. Brownlee further assured Rhinehart that the job would be available to him for up to three years if Rhinehart wanted it. Rhinehart was also told that if he accepted the role, he would receive a substantial salary increase (from approximately $101,000 CDN to $135,000 CDN).</P1>
<P1>11. In convincing him to take the position, company representatives also spoke positively about the Canadian health care system and suggested that Rhinehart would be required to work, on average, only 40 hours per week.</P1>
<P1>12. Based on the foregoing representations, Rhinehart accepted the position in Toronto. He then received a letter from Brownlee for presentation to the Canadian government to obtain a work permit. The letter confirmed the above-noted terms of his employment.</P1>
<P1>13. In the months leading up to his move to Toronto in December 2016, Rhinehart rearranged his life. He gave up his apartment, sold his car, put his belongings in storage and moved to Canada with as little as possible. He bought a new wardrobe of winter clothes. Rhinehart also made arrangements to fly his 14 year old daughter across the Canadian-American border during holidays and breaks from school. None of this was an easy task.</P1>
<P1>14. Rhinehart landed in Toronto on December 31, 2016 and started working for Legend 3D Canada as Compositing Supervisor on January 2, 2017. In that role, he supervised between 120 and 150 visual effects artists at any given time, working on feature films. He was involved in hiring and training, and worked with the company's production department to meet critical deadlines.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Misrepresentations and Breach of Contract</TI>
<P><P1>15. Soon after Rhinehart commenced employment for Legend 3D Canada, he quickly realized that he had been misled about his hours of work. Despite the fact that he was told that his average working hours would be limited to about 40 per week, he was required to work between 10 and 14 hours a day or 70 to 90 hours a week, with little (if ever any) time off in between. There were many months in which Rhinehart worked consecutive days without a day off. He complained about his hours of work repeatedly to his senior producer Chris McClintock, and his production department managers Neha Pasricha and Ashley Merla, to no avail.</P1>
<P1>16. Legend 3D Canada advised Rhinehart of his dismissal on February 6, 2018. The dismissal took effect on March 30, 2018.</P1>
<P1>17. At the time of his dismissal, Rhinehart was earning $135,266 CDN per annum and participated in an employer-sponsored group benefits insurance program. He was 33 years old.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Damages</TI>
<P><P1>18. In light of the foregoing, Rhinehart states that he was employed by the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants in Canada under a three-year fixed-term employment agreement. It was an express or implied term of this agreement that the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants could not terminate his employment without providing him with advanced notice of termination or pay in lieu of such notice representing the difference between three years and the amount of time he actually worked for the <UNDER>Corporate Defendants</UNDER> in Toronto.</P1>
<P1>19. As of March 30, 2018, Rhinehart worked for the Defendants in Toronto for 15 months. He is therefore owed 21 months of pay for the balance of his contract, equal to $236,715.50, less statutory deductions and withholdings and amounts he received from the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants following his dismissal. Rhinehart is additionally entitled to damages <UNDER>from them</UNDER> for the loss of his benefits subsequent to March 30, 2018.</P1>
<P1>20. In the alternative, Rhinehart states that it was an implied term of his contract of employment with the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants that they could not terminate his employment in Toronto without providing him with reasonable advanced notice of termination or payment of damages in lieu of such notice at common law. In light of his 33 years of age, over five years of service to the Defendants, the character of his employment, and other factors, he is entitled to his total compensation prorated over six months (or damages for the loss thereof), less the value of payments made to him or benefits continued subsequent to his dismissal.</P1>
<P1>21. Rhinehart further states that he is entitled to a lump sum payment of $169,082.50 <UNDER>from the Corporate Defendants</UNDER>, being his salary prorated over 15 months of work up to March 31, 2018. He is entitled to such compensation on a contractual, restitutionary, or <EM>quantum meruit</EM> basis on account of the fact that he worked, on average, roughly twice as many hours as he was told that he would need to work. Rhinehart additionally states that such compensation unpaid constitutes a debt pursuant to s. 130 of the OBCA and s. 81 of the ESA for which Cashion and Mandanna are personally liable, jointly and severally, under such legislation, to a degree not exceeding six months of Rhinehart's wages.</P1>
<P1>22. Rhinehart states that the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants are liable to him in the amount of $25,000 on the basis of a negligent misrepresentation. The <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants advised Rhinehart that he could work in Canada for three years; Rhinehart relied upon such representation in deciding to move to Toronto; and the <UNDER>Corporate</UNDER> Defendants breached such representation to his detriment shortly after he did so. The <STRIKE>Defendants</STRIKE> Plaintiff's losses include but are not limited to moving and travel expenses.</P1>
<P1>23. Rhinehart proposes that this action be tried in the City of Toronto.</P1></P>

<P>2. The Defendants deny the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 3, 6 through 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 17 through 22 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. The Defendants have no knowledge in respect of the allegations contained in paragraphs 9 and 13 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE PARTIES</TI>
<P>4. The Defendant, Legend 3D Inc., (&ldquo;Legend 3D&rdquo;) is a business incorporated pursuant to the laws of of the United States of America and is in the business of providing digital media services.</P>
<P>5. The Defendant, Legend 3D Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Legend 3D Canada&rdquo;), is a corporation duly incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario.</P>
<P>6. Joseph Cashion and Sarita Mandanna (collectively the &ldquo;Directors&rdquo;) are individuals residing in Toronto, Ontario and were the Directors of Legend 3D Canada.</P>
<P>7. Legend 3D Canada and Legend 3D (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Corporate Defendants&rdquo;) state that the Plaintiff, Andrew Rhinehart, was employed in the position of Compositing Supervisor on an indefinite term employment contract at the time his employment was terminated without cause on February 6, 2018.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>BACKGROUND</TI>
<P>8. On or about November 26, 2012, the Plaintiff was hired by the Corporate Defendants in the position of Junior Stereo Compositor to work out of its Los Angeles location with the employment to end on April 5, 2013.</P>
<P>9. The Plaintiff executed an offer of employment on November 26, 2012 (&ldquo;Offer of Employment No. 1&rdquo;). The Offer of Employment No. 1 specifically provides that all disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration and states:
<QUOTE><P>All of us at Legend are very excited about you joining our team and look forward to a beneficial and fruitful relationship. <UNDER>However, should any dispute arise with respect to your employment or the termination of that employment, we both agree that such dispute shall be conclusively resolved by final binding and confidential arbitration</UNDER> in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in San Diego, rather than by a jury court or administrative agency. The Company will bear those expenses unique to arbitration. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>10. The Plaintiff also executed an Arbitration Agreement on November 26, 2012, prior to the commencement of his employment (hereinafter &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement No. 1&rdquo;). Arbitration Agreement No. 1 states, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following:
<QUOTE><P>Legend 3D Inc. (&ldquo;Legend&rdquo;) and <UNDER>I each agree to submit to final and binding arbitration any and all disputes that we could otherwise pursue in court that arise from or relate in any way to my recruitment, hiring, employment, or the termination of my employment, with Legend</UNDER>. This includes, without limitation, any claim against Legend or any of its employees or agents based on any state or federal statute (including claims for employment discrimination, retaliation or harassment, unpaid wages, or based on the California Labour Code), <UNDER>as well as any common law claim</UNDER> (including claims for breach of contract or breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful discharge, defamation, <UNDER>misrepresentation</UNDER>, fraud, and infliction of emotional distress), but excludes claims for workers' compensation benefits, state disability benefits, or state unemployment benefits. [Emphasis Added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>11. Arbitration Agreement No. 1 also contains various terms and conditions which include the following:
<P1>a) The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator;</P1>
<P1>b) The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association for resolution of employment disputes;</P1>
<P1>c) The arbitration shall take place in the City of San Diego;</P1>
<P1>d) Legend 3D shall pay the arbitrator's fee and will bear all other administrative charges beyond those that the employee would have otherwise had to pay if he or she filed a lawsuit in Court;</P1>
<P1>e) The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of relief that would be available in a Court of competent jurisdiction; and,</P1>
<P1>f) The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any Court of competent jurisdiction.</P1></P>
<P>12. The Plaintiff's employment was extended due to additional projects and as such, the Plaintiff executed a second Offer of Employment on February 18, 2013 (Offer of Employment No. 2&rdquo;). The Offer of Employment No. 2 provides, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Plaintiff's employment would cease on June 21, 2013. Further, it includes an identical provision as Offer of Employment No. 1 requiring all disputes to be resolved via arbitration and as cited at paragraph 9 herein.</P>
<P>13. The Plaintiff's employment was terminated in or around June 2013 due to a shortage of work.</P>
<P>14. The Plaintiff was rehired in or around August 2013 in the position of Junior Stereo Compositor and executed a third Offer of Employment dated June 20, 2013 (&ldquo;Offer of Employment No. 3&rdquo;). The Offer of Employment No. 3 provides, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Plaintiff would commence employment on August 12, 2013 and includes an identical provision as Offer of Employment No. 1 requiring all disputes to be resolved via arbitration and as cited at paragraph 9 herein.</P>
<P>15. The Offer of Employment No. 3 also provides that the Plaintiff's employment would cease on February 28, 2014.</P>
<P>16. The Plaintiff also executed a second Arbitration Agreement on August 12, 2013 (&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement No. 2&rdquo;). Arbitration Agreement No. 2 is identical to Arbitration Agreement No. 1.</P>
<P>17. The Corporate Defendants extended the Plaintiff's employment for a fourth time and as such, the Plaintiff executed a further Offer of Employment on December 18, 2013 (&ldquo;Offer of Employment No. 4&rdquo;). The Offer of Employment No. 4 provides that the Plaintiff's employment shall end on June 2, 2014 and includes an identical provision as Offer of Employment No. 1 requiring all disputes to be resolved via arbitration and as cited at paragraph 9 herein.</P>
<P>18. The Plaintiff's employment was further extended in June 2014 on an indefinite term basis. In or around December 2014, the Plaintiff was promoted to the position of Lead Compositor.</P>
<P>19. In or around December 2016, the Corporate Defendants offered certain employees based in Los Angeles the opportunity to transfer to its office in the City of Toronto. The transfer was strictly optional. The Plaintiff accepted the offer to transfer to the City of Toronto.</P>
<P>20. The Plaintiff was required to apply for a temporary work permit from the Government of Canada to enable him to legally work in Ontario.</P>
<P>21. The Defendants state that a letter was provided to the Canada Border Services Agency of the Government of Canada in support of the Plaintiff's temporary work permit application to increase the likelihood the Plaintiff's request for a work permit would be approved. Similar letters were provided in support of all applications by employees of the Corporate Defendants who sought to transfer to Toronto.</P>
<P>22. The Plaintiff successfully received the work permit and commenced employment in Toronto on January 3, 2017 in the position of Compositing Supervisor.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION</TI>
<P>23. As pled in the Statement of Claim, this action is related to or arises out of the Plaintiff's recruitment, hiring, employment or the termination of his employment and as such, is subject to binding private arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of Arbitration Agreement No. 1, Arbitration Agreement No. 2 and the four Offers of Employment. Therefore, this action cannot be maintained.</P>
<P>24. The Defendants do not waive the provisions requiring private arbitration as specified in Arbitration Agreement No. 1, Arbitration Agreement No. 2 or the four Offers of Employment by issuance of this Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>25. The Defendants plead that pursuant to Arbitration Agreement No. 1, Arbitration Agreement No. 2 and the Offers of Employment, the Ontario courts do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendants and that this proceeding ought therefore to be dismissed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>NO DAMAGES</TI>
<P>26. In the alternative, if the Plaintiff is capable of maintaining this action, which is not admitted but specifically denied, the Defendants specifically deny that the Plaintiff is entitled to the amounts sought and puts the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>a</EM>.</N><TI><EM>There was no Fixed-Term Employment Agreement</EM></TI>
<P>27. The Defendants specifically deny that the Plaintiff was employed pursuant to a three year fixed-term employment agreement as alleged and puts the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>28. The Defendants state that the Plaintiff commenced employment in November 2012 and worked pursuant to a series of fixed term contracts until he transitioned to indefinite term employment in December 2014.</P>
<P>29. The Defendants state that the Plaintiff was not provided with, nor signed an employment agreement which explicitly stated a fixed term duration of employment with the Corporate Defendants when he transferred to the City of Toronto. Further, the terms and conditions of his employment were not altered by the transfer and he remained an indefinite term employee.</P>
<P>30. The Corporate Defendants did not make any representations to the Plaintiff as to the expected duration of the position in Toronto. Specifically, the Corporate Defendants deny that any representations were made regarding the Plaintiff being guaranteed a minimum of three years of employment in Ontario and puts the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>31. The Defendants specifically deny that the letter to the Canada Border Services Agency constitutes a fixed term employment agreement and puts the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>32. The Plaintiff was terminated on February 6, 2018 due to companywide restructuring and provided eight (8) weeks of working notice and the offer for an economy flight from Toronto to the United States.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>b</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Plaintiff is not entitled to Common Law Reasonable Notice</EM></TI>
<P>33. The Defendants specifically deny that the Plaintiff is entitled to six months of common law reasonable notice as sought and puts the Plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.</P>
<P>34. The Defendants state that given the Plaintiff's age and mid-level management position, a six month notice period is excessive.</P>
<P>35. Further, the Defendants state that the Plaintiff has failed to take any steps or any reasonable and sufficient steps to mitigate his damages, if any. The Defendants further states that the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence that he has attempted to mitigate his damages.</P>
<P>36. The Defendants state that the Plaintiff has an affirmative obligation to mitigate any losses and damages he has sustained. To the extent that it may be found that the Plaintiff has failed to mitigate, the Defendants request that any award in the Plaintiff's favour be reduced accordingly.</P>
