<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF LINDSEY ASH</TI>
<P>I, Lindsey Ash, of the Regional Municipality of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, MAKE OATH AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am employed as a Legal Assistant, with the Tax Law Services Section, Department of Justice Canada in the Atlantic Regional Office and as such have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. The Applicant's Affidavit was due to be served on June 4, 2014.</P>
<P>3. On June 19, 2014, the Applicant's affidavit was received at the Department of Justice office in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A true copy of the Affidavit, with date stamped tab, is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>4. On June 19, 2014, Caitlin Ward, Counsel of record in this application, wrote to the Applicant and advised him that the Respondent had received his affidavit, which was due on June 4, 2014. She further advised him that she consented to an extension of 15 days to have the Applicant's affidavit served and advised the Applicant to provide the letter with proof of service to the Court. A copy of the letter sent by Caitlin Ward on June 19, 2014 is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>5. I have reviewed the online Federal Court Registry records with respect to this application. The online information shows that the Applicant late filed his Affidavit of Service confirming service of his Affidavit and that the Federal Court Registry in Toronto did not accept the Applicant's Affidavit of Service. A true copy of the online Federal Court Registry record with respect to this application is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>
<P>6. On July 9, 2014, the Respondent served the Applicant with its Affidavit pursuant to Rule 307 of the <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM> by courier. The Respondent filed the Solicitor's Certificate of Service on July 9, 2014. A true copy of the letter to the Applicant dated July 9, 2014, without attachments and the solicitor's certificate of service filed by the Respondent are attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>7. I am advised by Caitlin Ward, and do verily believe, that she received a telephone call from Elizabeth Caverly, the Director of the Courts Administrative Service of the Federal Court in Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 10, 2014. Ms. Caverly advised Ms. Ward that the Respondent had late filed proof of service of the Respondent's affidavit. She further advised that the Applicant's Affidavit of Service had not been accepted for filing by the Federal Court Registry in Toronto.</P>
<P>8. Until advised by Ms. Caverly that the Applicant's Affidavit of Service had not been accepted for filing, the Respondent was not aware that the date for service of the Respondent's affidavit was to be calculated based on the original due date of the Applicant's Affidavit, being June 4, 2014 and not the extended date consented to by the Respondent, being June 19, 2014.</P>

<P1>5. Granting of the Applicants motion will not prejudice the Respondent</P1>

<P>1] I first filed on May 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 2014 to start the proceeding. I spent approximately 1 hour there trying to understand all the procedures that followed and timelines as I am new to this</P>
<P>I was told by one of the staff at the counter that first I was to for 30 days, for them to respond and once received I had 20/30 days to send an affidavit to them, which i did, by courier or registered mail. I did this on June 19<SUP>th</SUP> and did not get their response till near the end of 30 days of applying Then I was told I had to wait till they received it and file proof of service within 20 days of them receiving it.</P>
<P>This is the procedure I followed and hence I arrived at the court office to file the proof of service on July 7th, 2014. Given what I was told this was bang on within the time frame</P>
<P>I then received in the mail a day later, the returned proof of service telling me I filed too late and have to file a request for extension.</P>
<P>Hence what I am doing now.</P>
<P>I have to say I am very frustrated because I followed what I thought I was told to do and now find out I was given apparently wrong info. I did not file late because of being tardy I followed what I thought was the correct procedure and time limits.</P>
<P>2] This was very frustrating as I spent a good hour in the office with someone explaining what I had to do.</P>
<P>But either way it would have been impossible for me to serve my affidavit and proof of service within 30 days after the application even had I been explained the procedure properly or understood it properly.</P>
<P>By the time I received the respondents response, to my application 30 days was almost up. So how could I or any normal person read through their massively huge response, type a response in an affidavit and gather needed evidence to support it[exhibits] get it commissioned and then serve it and then wait till you can get proof you served it and then come down to your office and file proof of service, all in 30 days? This would have been absolutely impossible and even the agent whom called me today[July 9th/14, acknowledged that they can see that this would have been impossible and went on to explain how I could have applied at that time for an extension agreement with the other party. But that is also too late now.</P>
<P>Very frustrating.</P>
<P>I appreciate the courts understanding this and granting an extension to file. I had Already filed and have the paper work ready.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I, Lindsey Ash, of the Regional Municipality of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, MAKE OATH AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am employed as a Legal Assistant, with the Tax Law Services Section, Department of Justice Canada in the Atlantic Regional Office and as such have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. The Applicant's Affidavit was due to be served on June 4, 2014.</P>
<P>3. On June 19, 2014, the Applicant's affidavit was received at the Department of Justice office in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A true copy of the Affidavit, with date stamped tab, is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>4. On June 19, 2014, Caitlin Ward, Counsel of record in this application, wrote to the Applicant and advised him that the Respondent had received his affidavit, which was due on June 4, 2014. She further advised him that she consented to an extension of 15 days to have the Applicant's affidavit served and advised the Applicant to provide the letter with proof of service to the Court. A copy of the letter sent by Caitlin Ward on June 19, 2014 is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>5. I have reviewed the online Federal Court Registry records with respect to this application. The online information shows that the Applicant late filed his Affidavit of Service confirming service of his Affidavit and that the Federal Court Registry in Toronto did not accept the Applicant's Affidavit of Service. A true copy of the online Federal Court Registry record with respect to this application is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>.</P>

Ms. Caverly advised Ms. Ward that the Respondent had late filed proof of service of the Respondent's affidavit. She further advised that the Applicant's Affidavit of Service had not been accepted for filing by the Federal Court Registry in Toronto.</P>
<P>8.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1] Around the end of August i called Caitlin Ward as i could see time for Respondents counsel filing was very late and was concerned of the next steps and making sure i had and was following procedures of which upon going down to the filing office on Queen St, Toronto [after leaving a message] i found i had.</P>
<P>2] This filing office informed me that i should file an Applicants record ASAP as given that the time for CRA's filing of proof of service was really late that my time to file Applicants record was almost up. So i spent time at internet doing this and was about to file it as only a few days left when i received CRA's counsel's request for extension and explanation.</P>
<P>3] I do not feel that inadvertence is a good excuse to grant this extension. Caitlin Ward is a very experienced lawyer who specifically deals with these matters all the time and knows the exact time periods to file[unlike myself who is new to this and does not have a lawyer] She stated that she had &ldquo;forgotten' and that without my phone call she would have not realized period. This is a very poor reason to grant an extension and has only delayed this procedure by at least a couple of months and i am the only one who suffers from it as i am in a very precarious state of survival right now given my accident and huge loss of income this relief application is huge for me</P>
<P>4] After rushing down to the CRA filing office and discovering that i had only a few days to file an Applicants Record-as i was advised i needed to do ASAP by them given that due to CRA not filing affidavit of service, a Cross Examination was no longer needed or part of the process.. I felt like this possibly was done on purpose as CRA lawyers know i am inexperienced and doing this on my own and put me in a panic position. If i had not walked into that office there was a strong chance that by CRA &ldquo;forgetting&rdquo; to file that i was the one who would pay for it</P>
<P>5] We should already be past the applicants record stage and we are not and it is only because of an experienced lawyer forgetting and wants to be saved only because I called.</P></BLOCK1>
