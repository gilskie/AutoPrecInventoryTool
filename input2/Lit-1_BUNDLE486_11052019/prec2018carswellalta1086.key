<P>1. These written submissions are filed in respect of an application for advice and direction brought by MNP Ltd. (the &ldquo;Trustee&rdquo;), in its capacity as Trustee of the bankrupt estate of Cindy Hannele Chomistek (&ldquo;Ms. Chomistek&rdquo; or the &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;), as to entitlement to certain income tax refunds paid as a result of disability tax credits claimed by Ms. Chomistek on behalf of her disabled child.</P>
<P>2. Due to amendments made to the relevant provisions of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM> (Canada) (the &ldquo;BIA&rdquo;) over the years and divergent court decisions across Canada, Registrar Prowse directed the Trustee's application for advice and direction be adjourned to be heard as a special application.</P>
<P>3. Neither the bankrupt estate nor Ms. Chomistek had the resources to engage legal counsel. However, Registrar Prowse considered it necessary and appropriate that the legal issues raised in this matter be researched and briefed by an impartial legal advisor for the assistance of this Honourable Court. Accordingly, he appointed Miles Davison LLP as <EM>amicus curiae</EM> to prepare and make submissions at this special application. In these submissions, documents attached to Part 1 (Analysis) will be tabbed alphabetically, while cases and commentary attached to Part 2 (Authorities) will be tabbed numerically. A filed copy of the Order granted by Registrar Prowse on October 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, 2017 appointing the <EM>Amicus Curiae</EM> is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB A</BOLD>.</P>
<P>4. We have also served the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (&ldquo;OSB&rdquo;) with notice of this special application by our letter dated October 26<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017, a copy of which (without enclosures) is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB B.</BOLD></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>MATERIALS FILED</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. In addition to its application for advice and direction, the Trustee filed a Trustee's Report dated July 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017. The bankrupt filed written submissions in response dated July 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2017.</P>
<P>6. No Affidavits have been filed and no examinations have occurred. However, the basic facts are not in dispute.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>RELEVANT FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. Ms. Chomistek assigned herself into bankruptcy on May 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2013, after her consumer proposal was not accepted. MNP Ltd. was appointed as Trustee of her bankrupt estate. Ms. Chomistek has not previously been bankrupt.</P>
<P>8. A copy of Ms. Chomistek's Statement of Affairs as a bankrupt is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the Trustee's Report and is attached here at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB C</BOLD>.</P>
<P>9. The Trustee's Final Statement of Receipts and Disbursements is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; to the Trustee's Report and is attached here at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB D</BOLD>. Ms. Chomistek had proven unsecured claims of $109,947.50 and her creditors received very small dividends.</P>
<P>10. Ms. Chomistek was automatically discharged from bankruptcy on February 15<SUP>th</SUP>, 2014. The Trustee received its own discharge on September 29<SUP>th</SUP>, 2015. A current OSB search of Ms. Chomistek is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB E</BOLD>.</P>
<P>11. After Ms. Chomistek was discharged from bankruptcy, she came across a newspaper advertisement regarding disability tax credits. Ms. Chomistek states in her submissions that, after further inquiry, she realized she could apply for a disability tax credit on behalf of her disabled child for the current taxation year and previous taxation years, going back to the time her child was 4 years old. Ms. Chomistek accordingly claimed these credits and re-filed her personal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2014 with Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;).</P>
<P>12. On January 8<SUP>th</SUP>, 2016, CRA sent a letter to Ms. Chomistek discussing her request for an adjustment to her personal income tax returns to &ldquo;include the transfer of your [child's] disability amount for the 2005 to 2014 taxation years&rdquo;. A copy of this letter is attached as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; to the Trustee's Report and is attached here at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB F</BOLD>.</P>
<P>13. The Trustee subsequently received two cheques from CRA totalling $20,339.82. According to the Trustee's Report, these cheques were made payable to MNP Ltd. in its capacity as Trustee of Ms. Chomistek's bankrupt estate. As well, the Trustee received Notices of Reassessment pertaining to these tax refunds. The taxation years involved and the refunds received for each year are summarized in the Trustee's Report (page 2) and re-stated here:

<P>15. <UNDER>Section 2</UNDER>
<P1>Section 2 of the BIA broadly defines &ldquo;property&rdquo; as follows:
<QUOTE><P>property means any type of property, whether situated in Canada or elsewhere, and includes money, goods, things in action, land and every description of property, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, as well as obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in, arising out of or incident to property;</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>We note that Section 2 does not define &ldquo;income&rdquo; or &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;.</P1></P>
<P>16. <UNDER>Section 67</UNDER>
<P1>Section 67 of the BIA describes the &ldquo;property&rdquo; of a bankrupt divisible among his or her creditors. In our respectful submission, it is critical to an understanding and analysis of the issues in this application to appreciate the legislative history of section 67 and, in particular, the substantial amendments which came into force in 2008 and 2009, which we discuss below.

<P>18. In 2005, a comprehensive insolvency reform package was introduced in Parliament to modernize the BIA and the <EM>Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act</EM> (&ldquo;CCAA&rdquo;), as well as to create the legislative framework for the Wage Earner Protection Program. The Bill received Royal assent on November 25<SUP>th</SUP>, 2005, thereby becoming Chapter 47 of the <EM>Statutes of Canada</EM>, 2005 (&ldquo;Chapter 47&rdquo;). The pages of Chapter 47 relevant to this application are attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB M</BOLD>.</P>
<P>19. Certain technical amendments were required to be made to Chapter 47 before some of its provisions could be brought into force. These technical amendments were contained in a Bill to amend the BIA, the CCAA, the <EM>Wage Earner Protection Program Act</EM> (&ldquo;WEPPA&rdquo;) and Chapter 47. This Bill received Royal assent on December 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2007, thereby becoming Chapter 36 of the <EM>Statutes of Canada</EM>, 2007 (&ldquo;Chapter 36&rdquo;). The pages of Chapter 36 relevant to this application are attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB N</BOLD>.</P>
<P>20. Certain provisions of Chapter 47 were only to come into force on proclamation, including the amendments to sections 67 and 68. Some of these provisions in Chapter 47, as amended by Chapter 36, came into force on July 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2008 by means of SI 2008-78, which is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB O</BOLD>. The rest of these provisions of Chapter 47, as amended by Chapter 36, came into force on September 18<SUP>th</SUP>, 2009, pursuant to SI 2009-68, which is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB P</BOLD>.</P>
<P>21. As a consequence of these amendments and later proclamations, the amendments to section 67 came into force on July 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2008 and the amendments to section 68 came into force on September 18<SUP>th</SUP>, 2009. What is confusing is that the amendments to sections 67 and 68 of the BIA introduced by Chapter 47 were not immediately proclaimed in force, but the further revisions to these amendments made by Chapter 36 received Royal assent on December 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2007, so it was section 57 of Chapter 47, as already amended by section 32 of Chapter 36, which came into force on July 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2008 and amended section 67 to read as it does today. Similarly, section 58 of Chapter 47, as already amended by section 33 of Chapter 36, came into force on September 18<SUP>th</SUP>, 2009 and amended section 68 to read as it does today.</P>
<P>22. Section 71 of the BIA is the general vesting section and it reads as follows:
<QUOTE><P>On a bankruptcy order being made or an assignment being filed with an official receiver, a bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to dispose of or otherwise deal with their property, which shall, subject to this Act and to the rights of secured creditors, immediately pass to and vest in the trustee named in the bankruptcy order or assignment, and in any case of change of trustee the property shall pass from trustee to trustee without any assignment or transfer.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada) (&ldquo;ITA&rdquo;)</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. Section 118.3 of the ITA sets out the provisions governing disability tax credits and is attached at <BOLD>Part 1, TAB Q.</BOLD></P>
<P>24. Generally speaking, the disability tax credit (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;DTC&rdquo;) is a non-refundable tax credit available to disabled taxpayers, or taxpayers upon whom disabled individuals are financially dependent and/or for whom they provide care, provided they meet the conditions set out in section 118.3 of the ITA. On its website, Canada Revenue Agency describes the purpose of the DTC as &ldquo;to provide for greater tax equity by allowing some relief for disability costs, since these are unavoidable additional expenses that other taxpayers don't have to face&rdquo;. We will further discuss the nature and character of a DTC and the tax refund it can generate below.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. <UNDER>ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. The issue is who, as between the Trustee and Ms. Chomistek, is entitled to all or part of the income tax refunds received by the Trustee as a result of disability tax credits claimed by Ms. Chomistek, after the date of her discharge from bankruptcy, on behalf of her disabled child.</P>
<P>26. The answer to this question will depend on the nature of a DTC and the true character of the income tax refunds it generates. Therefore, to answer this main question, we must consider these further issues:
<P1>(a) Are the tax refunds payable by reason of the disability tax credits claimed by Ms. Chomistek &ldquo;property&rdquo; or &ldquo;income&rdquo;, and can they, for some purposes, be both?</P1>
<P1>(b) If such refunds are &ldquo;property&rdquo;, then are they property of the bankrupt at the date of bankruptcy or acquired by or devolving on her before her discharge or, put another way, given that the tax refunds were applied for and paid after the date of Ms. Chomistek's discharge, do we look at the time of receipt or the taxation years to which the refunds relate?</P1>
<P1>(c) Are the tax refunds monies to be held in trust by Ms. Chomistek for her disabled child or, put another way, whose property is it?</P1>
<P1>(d) Are the tax refunds &ldquo;exempt from execution or seizure&rdquo; under the laws of Alberta [section 67(1)(b)] or &ldquo;otherwise not subject to the operation of this Act&rdquo; [section 67(1)(c)(i)]?</P1>
<P1>(e) Are the tax refunds to be treated differently depending on the period to which they relate, that is, prior to bankruptcy, the year in which bankruptcy occurred, between bankruptcy and discharge, or after discharge?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. <UNDER>ANALYSIS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>What is the nature of a disability tax credit?</UNDER></TI>
<P>27. There is a good discussion of the nature of a disability tax credit by Registrar Diamond in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Bowerbank-Buckley</SOC></CASEREF> (to be further discussed below). At paragraph 25 of his reasons, Registrar Diamond quotes Professor David Duff as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Professor David Duff explains in McGill Law Journal article <UNDER>Disability and the Income Tax</UNDER>, that a DTC is ultimately intended to be a compensation for expenses, but has been drafted in the form of a fixed credit so that it can cover generalized, non-itemizable costs associated with living with a disability:</P>
<P>.... to the extent that disabilities impose various kinds of costs, some of which are indirect and difficult to itemize, these are appropriately recognized through a credit or deduction equal to a fixed dollar amount. ... Likewise, to the extent that restricted access to the marketplace and society at large causes disabled persons to incur higher costs for basic goods and services like groceries, a fixed credit or deduction recognizes these additional costs. In this respect, the DTC can be likened to an additional personal exemption to recognize non-discretionary but difficult to itemize costs associated with a mental or physical disability .....</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. Registrar Diamond goes on to say, at paragraph 26:
<QUOTE><P>This interpretation is significant, in light of the weight that Romilly, J. [in <EM>Bolz</EM>] placed upon the status of the funds as coming from non-refundable fixed credit status of the DTC. The DTC, in its intent, is related to taxable income in the same way that expense deductions would be: it is simply being framed in the form of a fixed credit to address the difficulty in accounting for many of the expenses associated with various disabilities. In that regard, <UNDER>the money is in the nature of a refund of the taxpayer's money</UNDER>, and not a grant of funds from the government's coffers. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Case Review</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. There is no way to draw any consistent conclusion from the reported cases which have considered the issues surrounding disability tax credits and the income tax refunds they generate. The dollar amounts involved are often relatively small and the trustee and/or the bankrupt frequently do not have legal counsel. As a result, not all of the relevant factors and considerations which, in our respectful view, should have been considered by some of the various courts were considered and, simply put, we think a number of the reported decisions are incorrect.</P>
<P>30. However, as <EM>amicus curiae</EM>, we think it is important to review all of the most frequently reported decisions, with a view to the timing of the decisions and the particular versions of sections 67 and 68 then being considered. Accordingly, we propose to review the decided cases in more or less chronological order, except that we will begin with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Marzetti v. Marzetti</SOC></CASEREF> and the Ontario Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Landry</SOC></CASEREF>, as these 2 decisions are critical to the analysis.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Marzetti</EM> (1994)</UNDER></TI>
<P>31. In <CASEREF><SOC>Marzetti v. Marzetti</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 SCR 765</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 1,</BOLD> the issue was entitlement to an income tax refund payable to the bankrupt which pertained to income he earned <UNDER>after</UNDER> his assignment into bankruptcy. The portions of the decision which are relevant here are the Court's discussion of whether the income tax refund is &ldquo;income&rdquo; or &ldquo;property&rdquo;, beginning at paragraph 32 of the decision.</P>
<P>32. At the time <EM>Marzetti</EM> was decided, section 67(1)(c) of the BIA simply read: &ldquo;all property wherever situated of the bankrupt at the date of his bankruptcy or that may be acquired by or devolve on him before his discharge&rdquo; (see Part 1, TAB G). It did not include the phrase &ldquo;including any refund owing to the bankrupt under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> in respect of the calendar year&mdash;or the fiscal year of the bankrupt if it is different from the calendar year&mdash;<UNDER>in which the bankrupt became bankrupt</UNDER>&rdquo; (emphasis added), nor did it include the exceptions in paragraphs 67(1)(c) (i) and (ii), the more relevant of which is (i) &ldquo;[the portion that] is not subject to the operation of this Act&rdquo;. [We note, in passing, that the current version of section 67(1)(c) only references any refund owing to the bankrupt under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> in respect of the year in which the bankrupt became bankrupt. It is does <UNDER>not</UNDER> expressly include or refer to income tax refunds for years <UNDER>prior to</UNDER> the date of bankruptcy, although some commentators and some of the newer cases have read that into the language.]</P>
<P>33. Similarly, the version of section 68 of the BIA which the Court considered in <EM>Marzetti</EM> (see Part 1, TAB J) included the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding section 67&rdquo;, while the current version of section 68 (see Part 1, TAB L) says &ldquo;despite paragraph 67(1)(b) and (b.3)&rdquo;. Most importantly, the version of section 68 considered in <EM>Marzetti</EM> did not limit &ldquo;total income&rdquo; to a bankrupt's revenues of &ldquo;whatever nature or from whatever source that are <UNDER>earned</UNDER> or <UNDER>received</UNDER> by the bankrupt <UNDER>between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge</UNDER>&rdquo; (emphasis added). The version of section 68 in <EM>Marzetti</EM> instead dealt with language which read, &ldquo;where a bankrupt is in receipt of, or is entitled to receive, any salary, wages or other remuneration from any person employing, or using the services of, the bankrupt&rdquo;, without any time limitation.</P>
<P>34. However, notwithstanding the amendments to sections 67 and 68 of the BIA which have been enacted since <EM>Marzetti</EM> was decided, this case is still very instructive and contains many concepts still directly applicable to the issues in this application.</P>
<P>35. Mr. Justice Iacobucci began his analysis by considering whether, in general terms, what was then the <EM>Bankruptcy Act</EM>'s reference to &ldquo;property&rdquo; was broad enough to embrace the facts of the case before him. He noted that Marzetti's income tax return was not filed until after his discharge from bankruptcy, and the refund related to income he earned following his assignment into bankruptcy. Accordingly, at the &ldquo;date of his bankruptcy&rdquo;, Marzetti had no interest in the tax refund because he had not earned the income yet. Nevertheless, His Lordship considered whether there was still a proprietary character to tax overpayments, noting that, not surprisingly, the Act defined the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in very broad terms. He found that even if a taxpayer who makes overpayments has no right to compel a refund prior to filing a return, that taxpayer has at least a future and contingent interest in the ultimate tax refund (paragraph 38). He concluded that the Act's reference to &ldquo;property&rdquo; was broad enough to embrace the facts of the case. More specifically, he concluded that Marzetti &ldquo;acquired at least a future and contingent interest in his income tax refund at the time excess overpayments were withheld on his behalf (paragraph 40).</P>
<P>36. Mr. Justice Iacobucci then turned to a consideration of whether what were then sections 67(c) and (d) should be read conjunctively or disjunctively. He found that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; which appears at the end of 67(c) must, by reason of its context, be read disjunctively (paragraph 45). In the result, he concluded that a bankrupt's interest in a post-bankruptcy income tax refund can be considered &ldquo;property&rdquo; for the purposes of section 67(c), and section 67(d) in no way qualified the operation of section 67(c).</P>
<P>37. However, his analysis did not end there. He found that his initial conclusion that the refund was &ldquo;property&rdquo; was overruled by section 68.</P>
<P>38. Mr. Justice Iacobucci's discussion of whether section 68 was a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo; in respect of a bankrupt's wages, or not, contains concepts which are directly applicable to the facts of this case. In paragraph 51, he discussed the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Industrial Acceptance Corp. v. Lalonde</SOC><CITE>[1952] 2 SCR 109</CITE></CASEREF>. In that case, the court was asked to decide whether wages or salary could be excluded from the definition of divisible property by what later became section 67(b) of the <EM>Bankruptcy Act</EM> [now section 67(1)(b) of the BIA], Section 67(b) then provided that divisible property would not comprise &ldquo;any property that as against the bankrupt is exempt from execution or seizure under the laws of the province within which the property is situated ...&rdquo;. The argument was made that this language did not exclude wages or salary because wages or salary could only be reached by a garnishee or attachment procedure, and not &ldquo;execution or seizure&rdquo;. The Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Industrial Acceptance Corp.</EM> rejected this distinction and held, at page 117, as quoted by Mr. Justice Iacobucci at paragraph 51 of his decision in <EM>Marzetti</EM>:
<QUOTE><P>It would appear that Parliament in adopting the language of [section 67(b)] intended that only such portion of the salary as was subject to seizure by legal process under the law of the respective provinces should vest in the trustee. Moreover, the omission of any such provision as that contained in section 51(1) of the <EM>English Act</EM>, under which, on the application of the trustee, an order might be made against the bankrupt in receipt of a salary to pay the whole or part thereof to the trustee, appears to support the foregoing view.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>39. In other words, as Mr. Justice Iacobucci put it at paragraphs 51 and 52:
<QUOTE><P>In modern terms, <EM>Industrial Acceptance Corp.</EM> established that the language of section 67(b), which removes from &ldquo;property of a bankrupt divisible among his creditors ... any property that as against the bankrupt is exempt from execution or seizure under the laws of the province&rdquo;, can operate to exclude wages or salary as contemplated by provincial exemptions.</P>
<P>In effect, therefore, the pre-amendment position was this: after taking into account provincial wage and salary exemptions, any remaining wages or salary of a bankrupt was &ldquo;property of a bankrupt divisible among his creditors&rdquo;. These excess wages vested automatically in the trustee.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>40. Mr. Justice Iacobucci went on to find that section 68 was a substantive provision which, because it applied &ldquo;notwithstanding section 67&rdquo;, operated as a complete code in respect of the listed forms of property (paragraph 61). Furthermore, while there have been attempts in some subsequently decided cases to limit Mr. Justice Iacobucci's reasoning to only post-bankruptcy wages, our respectful view is that his reasoning was intended to apply to both pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy wages, that is, wages owing to the bankrupt at the date of bankruptcy and wages earned by the bankrupt prior to his or her discharge. However, given the last amendments to section 68 which now restrict &ldquo;total income&rdquo; to revenues earned or received during the period of the bankruptcy, we think there are good arguments to be made that the &ldquo;pre-amendment position&rdquo; described in <EM>Marzetti</EM> now exists with respect to pre-bankruptcy wages that are not received during bankruptcy.</P>
<P>41. Finally, having concluded that anything called &ldquo;wages&rdquo; will not vest automatically in a trustee, because of how sections 67 and 68, as they then read, fit together, His Lordship turned to the question of whether the income tax refund should be considered &ldquo;wages&rdquo; for the purposes of section 68.</P>
<P>42. In the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, Mr. Justice Major held that Marzetti's refund retained the character of wages to the extent that it represented a return of employer-withholding deductions. Mr. Justice Iacobucci agreed with this conclusion but, in our respectful view, he went somewhat further. At paragraphs 78 and 79 of his decision, he said this:
<QUOTE><P>In my opinion, the transformation of Marzetti's wages over time does not alter their fundamental character. Marzetti earned a certain amount as wages after his voluntary assignment into bankruptcy. The fact that some portion of his wages was, by virtue of statute, automatically directed toward his tax liability does not affect the question. <UNDER>The intervention of statute speaks to how Marzetti spent his wages, not to how much he earned in the first place</UNDER>. In common parlance, taxpayers do not draw false distinctions between the wages they earn and the refunds they receive. As stated by Fullagar, J. in <EM>Federal Commissioner of Taxation</EM> supra, &ldquo;his right to payment arises because, and only because, he worked for a remuneration which is found, on a contingency which was contemplated throughout, not to have been paid to him in full.&rdquo; (p. 322)</P>
<P>Therefore, Major, J.A. was, I suggest, entirely justified in concluding that a tax refund is analytically similar to deferred wages in this case. He noted that &ldquo;if there is any money that can be easily traced in a modern society, it is the amount of taxes paid and the amount of taxes owed&rdquo; (p. 133). It is difficult to dispute this statement and I reject the ... suggestion that a wages-characterization is precluded by the commingling of withheld sums in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Equally, I agree with Major, J.A. that there is no necessary inconsistency between holding that at tax refund is a debt owed by the Crown, and holding that a tax refund represents deferred wages originally owed by an employer.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>43. Mr. Justice Iacobucci also agreed with Mr. Justice Major there was no doubt in the case before him that the post-bankruptcy income tax refund derived from Marzetti's wages, but he noted, &ldquo;(O)f course tax refunds can be generated from other sources of income. In the words of Major, J.A., therefore, the wages characterization &lsquo;depends on the nature of the refund&rsquo;&rdquo; (paragraph 80). In all of the circumstances, Mr. Justice Iacobucci concluded that the income tax refund payable to Marzetti &ldquo;retained&rdquo; its character as &ldquo;wages&rdquo; and that section 68, which governed as a complete code for wages, applied.</P>
<P>44. Similarly, in our case, there is no suggestion that Ms. Chomistek's income derived from anything other than her employment or other work.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Landry</EM> (2000)</UNDER></TI>
<P>45. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Landry</SOC><YEAR>2000</YEAR><CITE>21 CBR (4th) 58</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 2</BOLD>, was a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In that case, Ms. Landry had been dismissed from her employment as a pilot prior to making an assignment into bankruptcy in 1997. She brought a claim for unjust dismissal. She was discharged from bankruptcy in October, 1998, although the trustee had not yet been discharged at the time of the hearing before the Ontario Court of Appeal. In December, 1998, after Ms. Landry was discharged from bankruptcy, an arbitrator found she had been unjustly dismissed. While the exact amount to be paid to her was uncertain, the parties agreed that, as part of the award, some monies for lost wages would be paid.</P>
<P>46. By the time the <EM>Landry</EM> case came before the court, sections 67 and 68 had been amended. The versions of section 67 and 68 considered by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Landry</EM> appear at Part 1, TAB H and TAB K. The amendments made to section 67 since <EM>Marzetti</EM> were not particularly germane here, as those amendments simply added section 67(1)(b.1), dealing with goods and service tax credit payments. However, the amendments to section 68 were more substantial and, by the time <EM>Landry</EM> was decided, section 68 contained a definition of &ldquo;total income&rdquo; which was defined to include &ldquo;notwithstanding paragraph 67(1)(b) and (b.1), all revenues of a bankrupt of whatever nature or source&rdquo;. Again, we note at this time &ldquo;total income&rdquo; was not limited to amounts earned or received during the bankruptcy.</P>
<P>47. Mr. Justice Charron began his analysis in <EM>Landry</EM> by considering whether Ms. Landry's claim against the airline or any part of the resulting award constituted &ldquo;property&rdquo; that vested in the trustee under sections 67 and 71(2) of the BIA. At paragraph 15 of his decision, he said:
<QUOTE><P>It is clear that s. 67(1)(c) is wide enough to encompass Landry's claim against her former employer and, consequently, any award of damages (other than those relating to personal claims, see footnote 1, <EM>supra</EM>) would form part of the property divisible among her creditors under that provision. A question then arises whether any part of the property falls within the exception made for exempt property under section 67(1)(b).</P></QUOTE>
We note that in footnote 1, the trustee acknowledged that any award of damages relating to personal claims other than for lost wages would not form part of the bankrupt's estate, on the authority of <CASEREF><SOC>Holley v. Gifford Smith Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, a case which we discuss in more detail below.</P>
<P>48. Mr. Justice Charron then went on to consider whether any provincial exemption applied to a lost wages award pursuant to section 67(1)(b) so as to except any part of the property from the estate of the bankrupt. Ms. Landry relied on provisions of the Ontario <EM>Wages Act</EM> which provided that 80% of a person's wages were exempt from seizure or garnishment.</P>
<P>49. Mr. Justice Charron discussed the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1997] 3 SCR 701</CITE></CASEREF>. In <EM>Wallace</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that an arbitrator's award of damages for unjust dismissal, insofar as it related to lost wages, can be equated to actual wages. We have not attached a complete copy of the <EM>Wallace</EM> decision to our authorities. However, the headnote and the relevant pages from <EM>Wallace</EM> are attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 3</BOLD>.</P>
<P>50. The finding in <EM>Wallace</EM> that is of relevance to this application, and of relevance to the analysis in <EM>Landry</EM>, was the finding by the Supreme Court of Canada that Wallace, an undischarged bankrupt, could maintain his action against his former employer for damages for wrongful dismissal not because of the timing of the acquisition of the property but rather because of the nature of the property in question, which the court equated to &ldquo;wages&rdquo;. At paragraph 20, the Ontario Court of Appeal quoted Mr. Justice Iacobucci in <EM>Wallace</EM>, who said the following:
<QUOTE><P>As I see the matter, the underlying nature of the damages awarded in a wrongful dismissal action is clearly akin to the &ldquo;wages&rdquo; referred to in s. 68(1). In the absence of just cause, an employer remains free to dismiss an employee at an y time provided that reasonable notice of the termination is given. In providing the employee with reasonable notice, the employer has two options: either to require the employee to continue working for the duration of that period or to give the employee pay in lieu of notice: D. Harris, <EM>Wrongful Dismissal</EM> (1989) (loose-leaf), at p. 3&ndash;10. There can be no doubt that if the employer opted to require the employee to continue working during the notice period, his or her earnings during this time would constitute wages or salary under s. 68(1) of the Act. <UNDER>The only difference between these earnings and pay in lieu of notice is that the employee receives a lump sum payment instead of having that sum spread out over the course of the notice period. The nature of those funds remains the same and thus s. 68(1) will also apply in these circumstances.</UNDER></P>
<P>In the event that an employee is wrongfully dismissed, the measure of damages for wrongful dismissal is the salary the employee would have earned had the employee worked during the period of notice to which he or she was entitled. <CASEREF><SOC>Sylvester v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>[1997] 2 S.C.R. 315</CITE></CASEREF>. The fact that this sum is awarded as damages at trial in no way alters <UNDER>the fundamental character of the money</UNDER>. An award of damages in a wrongful dismissal action is in reality the wages that the employer ought to have paid the employee either over the course of the period of reasonable notice or as pay in lieu of notice. Therefore, in accordance with the exception which is carved out in s. 68(1) for &ldquo;salary, wages or other remuneration&rdquo;, this money is not divisible among a bankrupt's creditors and does not vest in the trustee. The right of action is the means of attaining these damages and is similarly exempt. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>51. In the result, on the authority of <EM>Wallace</EM>, Mr. Justice Charron concluded in <EM>Landry</EM> that, to the extent the arbitrator's award related to the pay Landry should have received in lieu of notice, the monies would constitute &ldquo;wages&rdquo; for the purpose of the section 67(1)(b) exception (the exemption provision). However, he also found, based on <EM>Wallace</EM>, that section 67 must be considered in conjunction with section 68. He then turned to a consideration of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <EM>Marzetti</EM>.</P>
<P>52. In <EM>Landry</EM>, Mr. Justice Charron noted the amendments which had been made to sections 67 and 68 since <EM>Marzetti</EM> and <EM>Wallace</EM> were decided. Under the version of section 68 considered in those cases, the Supreme Court of Canada had authoritatively determined that section 68 superceded the provisions of section 67 insofar as &ldquo;salary, wages or other remuneration&rdquo; from employment were concerned. The question then considered by Mr. Justice Charron was whether the same interpretation applied to the version of section 68 before him. That version of section 68 appears at Part 1, TAB K. He first noted that the amended version of section 68 which he was considering differed from the former version in a number of respects. Firstly, the new version did not refer to &ldquo;salary, wages or other remuneration&rdquo;, but to &ldquo;total income&rdquo;. Total income was defined as including &ldquo;notwithstanding section 67(1)(b) and (b.1), all revenues of a bankrupt of whatever nature or source&rdquo;. The new section still allowed the trustee to apply to the court for a determination of the amount that a bankrupt was required to pay to the estate of the bankrupt out of his or her total income, but &ldquo;an elaborate procedure must be followed&rdquo; before such an application was made. After reviewing this new procedure, Mr. Justice Charron concluded in <EM>Landry</EM> that the reasoning in <EM>Marzetti</EM> and <EM>Wallace</EM> that led to the conclusion that section 68 was a complete code with respect to wages applied equally to the new section 68 (paragraph 30). This meant that section 67 was superceded by the provisions of the current section 68 insofar as the &ldquo;total income&rdquo; of the bankrupt was concerned and therefore it followed that, as in <EM>Wallace</EM>, Ms. Landry's claim against her former employer and any consequent award relating to lost wages did not automatically vest in the trustee under sections 67 and 71. Resort could only be had to section 68 for payment of any portion thereof to the estate of the bankrupt.</P>
<P>53. Mr. Justice Charron did consider the transitional provisions and decided that the &ldquo;new&rdquo; section 68 applied, rather than the former section 68. Respectfully, we do not agree with his interpretation of the transitional provision, but for our purposes it does not matter.</P>
<P>54. Finally, the court in <EM>Landry</EM> considered whether the trustee was precluded from resorting to section 68 of the BIA by the fact that Ms. Landry had been discharged from bankruptcy, and found that the trustee was not. What is interesting is that the court throughout proceeded on the assumption that the award for wrongful dismissal, to the extent that it included a portion for lost wages, was subject to Ms. Landry's bankruptcy notwithstanding that the damages for lost wages would not be actually paid until sometime after her discharge. In other words, the court viewed it on an accrual basis rather than a cash received basis.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Chronological Review of Other Decided Cases re: DTC's and Income Tax Refunds</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. We now turn to a discussion of other decided cases, in approximate chronological order, which pertain to disability tax credits and the nature of the income tax refunds received. There is a group of cases dealing with &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; which we will discuss at the end.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Ali</EM> (1987)</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Ali</SOC><CITE>[1987] O.J. No. 2243</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 4</BOLD>, was a 1987 decision of Mr. Justice Saunders of the Ontario Supreme Court. In this case, the bankrupt had suffered a heart attack and was receiving monthly payments equivalent to 70% of his salary, up to a maximum of $4,000 per month, under a &ldquo;group disability income policy&rdquo; issued by a Canadian life insurance company to his employer, a Canadian chartered bank, as policyholder, with the bank responsible for the premiums. So long as the disability continued, the bankrupt was entitled to continue to receive payments until either death or attainment of retirement age. The payments were made monthly, in arrears, and the bankrupt was required, by the terms of the policy, to provide the insurer with medical and other proof to establish entitlement. As Justice Saunders put it, &ldquo;the document may fairly be described as an income replacement policy&rdquo; (paragraph 2).</P>
<P>57. In <EM>Ali</EM>, the trustee argued that the disability payments were not &ldquo;other remuneration&rdquo; within the meaning of what was then section 48, now section 68 (at the time, section 48 was substantially similar to the section 68 considered in <EM>Marzetti</EM>). The trustee also argued that because the payments were not received from the employer, but rather the insurer, section 68 did not apply. Finally, the trustee argued the bank was neither employing nor using the services of the bankrupt. The court did not accept these submissions. Mr. Justice Saunders found that the bankrupt remained an employee of the bank; the bank had entered into an agreement with the insurer to provide payments to employees who were disabled from working; and those payments were to replace income that would otherwise be payable. He found that the disability payments were &ldquo;other remuneration&rdquo; within the meaning of section 68.</P>
<P>58. We think these conclusions are sound. However, what interested us in the <EM>Ali</EM> decision was the justice's response to the argument that the payments under the disability income policy were in the nature of payments received in compensation for bodily injury or &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo;. At paragraph 3 of his decision, Mr. Justice Saunders did not accept this argument. He agreed that payments received in compensation for bodily injury were not property of a bankrupt divisible among his creditors. However, he found that payments under the policy were not made to compensate the bankrupt for pain and suffering, but rather to partially replace income he would otherwise have received.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Riel</EM> (1992)</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Riel</SOC><CITE>[1992] O.J. No. 714</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 5</BOLD>, was a 1992 decision of Mr. Justice Ground of the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division). We note that his decision was appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and the appeal was dismissed, without reasons.</P>
<P>60. In this case, prior to his bankruptcy, Mr. Riel was employed as a salesman with Re/Max and the bankrupt and Re/Max had entered into an employment agreement which provided that when any property listed with Re/Max was sold as a result of the employee's negotiations, the employee would be paid 95% of the commissions earned. It further provided that the employee's share of the commissions would become due and payable to the employee only once they were collected by Re/Max.</P>
<P>61. Several agreements of purchase and sale for some condominium units owned by a developer were executed before Mr. Riel's assignment into bankruptcy, but the actual closings did not occur until after the date of bankruptcy. A dispute then arose between Re/Max and the developer as to payment of the commissions, which was eventually settled. Re/Max was holding the portion of the settlement applicable to Mr. Riel's commissions in trust pending court direction.</P>
<P>62. Mr. Justice Ground acknowledged there did not appear to be any dispute that the relationship between Re/Max and the bankrupt was that of employer/employee, and the bankrupt's remuneration pursuant to such agreement was solely in the form of commissions. Counsel for the trustee argued that section 68 of the BIA applied only where a bankrupt was in receipt of or entitled to receive salary, wages or other remuneration from a person employing or using the services of <UNDER>the bankrupt</UNDER>, and Riel was not a bankrupt when he was employed and performed the services in respect of which the commissions are payable. Mr. Justice Ground accepted this argument and held that section 68, as it then read, was not intended to apply to remuneration for services rendered prior to the date of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>63. Respectfully, we do not think his decision on this point was correct. We note that <CASEREF><SOC>Re Riel</SOC></CASEREF> was decided <UNDER>before</UNDER> the <EM>Marzetti</EM> decision, and while Marzetti was concerned with an income tax refund payable in respect of post-bankruptcy earnings, we do not read <EM>Marzetti's</EM> conclusions that narrowly. Furthermore, in concluding that the bankrupt's commissions were property divisible by reason of section 67, Mr. Justice Ground gave no consideration to any possible provincial exemptions applicable to wages or other remuneration.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Burton</EM> (1994)</UNDER></TI>
<P>64. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Burton</SOC><YEAR>1994</YEAR><CITE>27 CBR (3d) 238</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 6</BOLD>, was a decision of Registrar Ferron of the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division). In that case, the bankrupt received Canada Pension Plan disability benefits. Registrar Ferron found that such payments were remuneration which could be ordered to be paid to the trustee under section 68 of the BIA. He noted that under the Canada Pension Plan, CPP disability benefit payments were exempt from attachment and could not be assigned or charged, and the provisions of the Ontario <EM>Pension Benefits Act</EM> were to the same effect, yet found that &ldquo;these provisions are not effective against the trustee, nor is there any provision of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM> which would exempt such payments&rdquo; (paragraph 4). Perhaps he meant that because the amounts were subject to section 68, the provisions of section 67(b) would not apply. In any case, his conclusion that such payments are remuneration subject to section 68, as it then read, does seem correct and, in that event, the exempt character of such payments could presumably be taken into account by the court. However, that was not discussed by Registrar Ferron in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Burton</SOC></CASEREF>.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Neufeld</EM> (1993)</UNDER></TI>
<P>65. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Neufeld</SOC><YEAR>1993</YEAR><CITE>CarswellAlta 548</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 7</BOLD>, was a 1993 decision of Registrar Alberstat of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. We note that the writer acted as counsel for the bankrupt in the <EM>Neufeld</EM> case. The facts in <EM>Neufeld</EM> were very similar to this case. The bankrupt's child was legally blind, and sometime after Mr. Neufeld was discharged from bankruptcy, he was advised to apply for a disability tax credit and deductions for his son for the current year and previous taxation years. He filed returns claiming the DTC and received a tax refund.</P>
<P>66. <EM>Neufeld</EM> was decided before <EM>Marzetti</EM>. There were no submissions made to Registrar Alberstat as to whether the income tax refund resulting from claiming the disability tax credit was &ldquo;property&rdquo; or &ldquo;income&rdquo;, and there was no discussion of whether such refund was subject to sections 67 or 68. Instead, the argument turned on the fact that anyone applying for a disability tax credit required a certificate from a qualified medical practitioner which confirmed that the disabled person had a prolonged impairment and was markedly restricted in his activities of daily living. Registrar Alberstat noted that, unlike other tax credits, the disability tax credit was not dependent upon receipts.</P>
<P>67. At paragraph 13 of his decision, Registrar Alberstat said the following:
<QUOTE><P>The tax credit is personal to the person disabled. It lives and dies with that disabled person. The clear policy reason allowing the transfer of unused amounts of the disability tax credit to a parent or spouse wholly or partially supporting that disabled person is to supply financial relief for the support and maintenance of that disabled person.</P></QUOTE>
He found that it would, unfair and inequitable for creditors to benefit financially from the disability of a child or spouse of a bankrupt. He found that the tax credit was personal to the disabled person, for the support and maintenance of that disabled person, and quite independent of the supporting parent or spouse's income or liabilities.</P>
<P>68. The arguments presented to Registrar Alberstat were entirely equitable. An analogy was drawn to damages for pain and suffering, and the court was referred to <CASEREF><SOC>Re Hollister</SOC></CASEREF>, a leading case on the subject, which is discussed below. In <CASEREF><SOC>Re Hollister</SOC></CASEREF>, Mr. Justice Fisher said the following:
<QUOTE><P>The law is well settled that the Bankruptcy Act never intended to increase the assets of an insolvent for division amongst his creditors, of monies recovered in an action for personal injuries, as these monies are awarded as damages to the debtor for his pain, suffering and loss of comfort of life, to pay his physician, nurses and hospital expenses, and to compensate him whilst he is incapacitated from earning a living for himself and his family ... Causes of action arising from bodily or mentally suffering, such as actions for assault, seduction, criminal conversation, and damages for personal injuries, remain in the bankrupt.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>69. Registrar Alberstat also referred to the decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Ritenberg v. Crown Trust Co.</SOC></CASEREF>, which was to the same effect, also discussed below.</P>
<P>70. The argument made before Registrar Alberstat was that if it was not for the disability of Mr. Neufeld's son, there would be no entitlement to a disability tax credit. The refund generated by the disability tax credit was intended to provide additional support for the child while he was incapacitated. It seemed then, and still seems, to be directly analogous to amounts awarded to alleviate personal suffering. In many ways &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; in this context does not mean a windfall so much as additional monies to meet higher expenses. It is also our view that Registrar Alberstat's view of the policy reasons behind a disability tax credit were correct, and in this respect, at least, subsequent cases have agreed with him. Also, when Registrar Alberstat said the disability tax credit &ldquo;lived and died with the disabled person&rdquo;, he meant, in our view, that if there was no disability, there would be no credit. However, the essence of his decision was that tax refunds received by the bankrupt by reason of a disabled child who was being supported partially or wholly by the bankrupt were not the bankrupt's property. They were, in effect, the property of the disabled child, although claimed by the parent for his child's benefit. He also found that a constructive trust argument may apply.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Sobieski</EM> (1997)</UNDER></TI>
<P>71. The decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Neufeld</SOC></CASEREF> has been criticized by a number of subsequently decided cases. One of these was <CASEREF><SOC>Re Sobieski</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>2 CBR (4th) 70</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 8</BOLD>, a decision of Registrar Lee of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, which was subsequently upheld by Mr. Justice Kennedy of that court.</P>
<P>72. In <EM>Sobieski</EM>, the facts were substantially similar to ours, except the bankrupt had a disabled mother. In that case, the bankrupt argued that the tax refund was never her property; if she did acquire an interest in the refund, it was not until after her discharge from bankruptcy; and if she acquired an interest in the refund prior to her discharge, then it was as a constructive trustee for her mother. The bankrupt relied on the <EM>Neufeld</EM> decision. In this case, the tax refunds were applicable to income earned by the bankrupt prior to the date of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>73. The trustee argued that during the years preceding her bankruptcy, the bankrupt had incurred obligations for which claims remained outstanding at the date of bankruptcy, and it would be unfair and inequitable for the creditors not to have the benefit of income earned in those years, unless there was some express provision of the <EM>Bankruptcy Act</EM> which excluded the refunds from property available to creditors. Registrar Lee agreed with the submissions of the trustee. He concluded, at paragraph 14, &ldquo;if the applicant had claimed the disability tax credit prior to her bankruptcy, she would have more disposable income and would have been able to pay more of her debts. If the bankrupt was truly contributing to the support of her parents, presumably some of the debt incurred was for the benefit of the parents.&rdquo; He found that the subject refunds were property of the bankrupt, subject to distribution among the bankrupt's creditors.</P>
<P>74. The Registrar's decision was appealed to Mr. Justice Kennedy, who dismissed the appeal [<CASEREF><SOC>Re Sobieski</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>2 CBR (4th) 70</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 9</BOLD>]. He noted the refunds were received by the bankrupt following her bankruptcy in respect of tax credits which could have been applied for at the time of bankruptcy and, accordingly, he was satisfied they fell within the provisions of section 67 of the BIA. It is interesting to note that both Registrar Lee and Justice Kennedy proceeded on the basis that the relevant timing was the period to which the tax refunds related, and not when they were actually received. At paragraph 9, Mr. Justice Kennedy said:
<QUOTE><P>The Act clearly contemplates that the monies that are within the control of the bankrupt at the time of bankruptcy are available for the creditors. There is no doubt either that these monies would, if they had been applied for during the bankruptcy, have been deemed bankrupt's property as opposed to her mother's.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>75. Neither Registrar Lee nor Mr. Justice Kennedy in <EM>Sobieski</EM> considered <EM>Marzetti</EM>. There was no discussion of whether the tax refunds could be &ldquo;income&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;property&rdquo;, nor was there any discussion of the analogy drawn between disability tax credits and the &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases. There was also no mention of possible provincial exemptions. While Registrar Lee noted the constructive trust argument, he simply rejected it without analysis.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>76. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Clifford</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>46 CBR (3d) 132</CITE></CASEREF>, which is attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 10</BOLD>, was a decision of Deputy Registrar Stevens of the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division. In this case, the bankrupt's employment was terminated prior to his bankruptcy and he subsequently received vacation pay, termination pay and deductions after a conditional order of discharge had been granted.</P>
<P>77. In <EM>Clifford</EM>, Deputy Registrar Stevens relied on 3 Ontario decisions, including <EM>Riel</EM>, to find that section 68 did not apply to pre-bankruptcy earnings. Again, this was a case where the court assumed that the period with respect to which the earnings related, and not the time the amounts were actually paid, was determinative. There was no discussion in <EM>Clifford</EM> of the <EM>Marzetti</EM> decision, nor was there any discussion of the exemption applicable to wages in Ontario or section 67(1)(b) of the BIA. Given the broad language in section 68 as it read at the time (the version considered in <EM>Marzetti</EM>), and given that we do not read <EM>Marzetti</EM> that narrowly, this decision does not seem correct.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Hynes</EM> (2000)</UNDER></TI>
<P>78. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Hynes</SOC><YEAR>2000</YEAR><CITE>20 CBR (4th) 98</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 11</BOLD>, was a decision of Registrar Hill of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. In this case, the bankrupt qualified for a pay equity payment which she received after she had made an assignment in bankruptcy but before her discharge. For the purposes of his decision, Registrar Hill characterized the payment as pre-bankruptcy earnings. That being the case, he then considered it necessary to consider whether or not the trustee's application for a conditional order of discharge, which sought to have Ms. Hynes pay all or part of the pay equity amount to the trustee, should instead have been made pursuant to section 68 of the BIA. The version of section 68 considered in <EM>Hynes</EM> was the <EM>Landry</EM> version, that is, it contained a definition of &ldquo;total income&rdquo;, but without the current version's limitation of &ldquo;total income&rdquo; to amounts earned or received by the bankrupt during the period of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>79. In our respectful submission, <EM>Hynes</EM> was a very well-reasoned decision. Registrar Hill squarely considered the issue of whether section 68 applied to both pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy wages and he correctly, in our view, concluded that section 68, as it then read, did apply to both pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy wages.</P>
<P>80. Registrar Hill referred to a very useful article which addressed the question written by Robert A. Klotz, &ldquo;Who Gets the Bankrupt's Pre-Bankrutcy Earnings?&rdquo; (2000) 15 CBR (4<SUP>th</SUP>) 153 (the &ldquo;Klotz article&rdquo;). The Klotz article is attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 12</BOLD>. In his article, Mr. Klotz analyzed, in particular, the approach taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Marzetti, Wallace</EM> and <CASEREF><SOC>Ramgotra (Trustee of) v. North American Life Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[196] 1 SCR 325</CITE></CASEREF>. The headnote from <EM>Ramgotra</EM> and the relevant pages of that decision dealing with these issues are attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 13</BOLD>.</P>
<P>81. In <EM>Hynes</EM>, Registrar Hill said the following, at paragraph 7, with which we agree:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Marzetti</EM> dealt with post-bankruptcy income, in the form of an income tax refund. However, nowhere in that case did the Court specifically restrict its findings as to the applicability of s. 68 to post-bankruptcy earnings. The Court found that s. 68 was a substantive rather than procedural modification to the scheme in existence prior to its enactment. This being the case, the Court held that s. 68 was intended to operate as a complete code in respect of a bankrupt's salary, wages, or other remuneration. Consequently, those forms of property did not fall within s. 67(c) of the Bankruptcy Act (as it then was titled) and were not to be considered &ldquo;property of a bankrupt divisible, amongst his creditors&rdquo; for the purposes of s. 67 (at p. 644, W.W.R.)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>82. Registrar Hill went on to say that the Supreme Court of substantive provision, rather than procedural, because that better reflected the language of s, 68 and &ldquo;as a substantive provision, would more effectively remedy the mischief which led to its enactment.&rdquo; (paragraph 8)</P>
<P>83. Registrar Hill acknowledged that section 68, as reviewed in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, and the version of section 68 before him, were somewhat different, since the amended version before him came into force on April 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 1998. However, neither section 68 as it was in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, nor as it read before him, specifically differentiated between pre and post-bankruptcy income (paragraph 9).</P>
<P>84. Registrar Hill also reviewed the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Ramgotra</EM>, where the court had occasion to refer to section 68. While section 68 played no part in that decision, Registrar Hill stated there could be no doubt that the court in <EM>Ramgotra</EM> regarded section 68 as dealing only with after-acquired wages, salary or other remuneration. However, in the <EM>Wallace</EM> case, which the Registrar also considered, the court found that Wallace's right to sue for severance pay arose not because of the time of the acquisition of a property right in that payment, but rather because of the nature of the property in question, i.e. wages (paragraph 16). As noted in the Klotz article, &ldquo;Wallace won not because his claim was after-acquired property, but because it derived from wages and thus fell within section 68&rdquo;.</P>
<P>85. In <EM>Hynes</EM>, Registrar Hill concluded that nothing in the amendments to section 68 which came into force in 1998 led him to conclude that section 68 was other than the substantive provision the Supreme Court of Canada found the prior version to be and, furthermore, section 68 had application to both pre and post-bankruptcy income. As he noted in paragraph 19 of his decision:
<QUOTE><P>If we are dealing with income from employment of &ldquo;whatever nature or source&rdquo;, surely we are dealing with both pre and post-bankruptcy income.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>86. Accordingly, at paragraph 23, Registrar Hill concluded that the pay equity settlement, which was paid after the date of bankruptcy, but which related to the period prior to bankruptcy, was &ldquo;wages&rdquo; and fell within section 68. Based on section 68 as it read at that time, we think he was entirely correct.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Cole</EM> (2001)</UNDER></TI>
<P>87. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Cole</SOC><CITE>[2001] NSJ No. 155</CITE></CASEREF> was another decision of Registrar Hill, and attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 14.</BOLD> In this case, Dr. Cole was involved in a motor vehicle accident and, as a result, was pursuing a claim for lost income. The lost income claim would involve both past and future lost income. The trustee brought an application for advice and directions as to the procedures to be followed by the trustee to seek the proceeds of the personal injury claim to the extent it included an amount for logs of income. The trustee applied on the basis that such an award for loss of income would be governed by section 68 of the BIA.</P>
<P>88. At paragraph 23, Registrar Hill noted that the loss of income claim being pursued by the bankrupt involved lost income arising before the date of her assignment in bankruptcy, during the period in which she is a bankrupt, and potentially for that time after she is discharged. He referred to his earlier decision in H<EM>ynes</EM> in which he concluded that the words &ldquo;total income&rdquo;, then defined in section 68 of the BIA, referred to all revenue of a bankrupt from whatever nature or source and included not only income accruing during the period of the bankruptcy, but income accruing prior to the date of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>89. In <EM>Cole</EM>, Registrar Hill also considered the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <EM>Landry</EM>, which had been released shortly before he rendered his decision in <EM>Hynes</EM> and of which he was not aware at the time he made his decision in <EM>Hynes</EM>. He concluded the decision in <EM>Landry</EM> &ldquo;confirms and comforts me in the decision I reached in <EM>Hynes</EM>&rdquo; (paragraph 26). He observed that the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <EM>Landry</EM> both &ldquo;implicitly and explicitly&rdquo; confirmed the view taken by him that section 68 had application to both pre and post-bankruptcy income. [Again, this case was decided before section 68 was further amended in 2009 to include the qualification it contains now, which limits &ldquo;total income&rdquo; to only those amounts earned or received during the period of bankruptcy.]</P>
<P>90. At paragraph 34 of his decision, Registrar Hill noted that the court in <EM>Landry</EM> reviewed the definition of a &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; and concluded the term not only referred to the legal status of the person during the period of bankruptcy, but was also descriptive of an individual who had made an assignment. Thus, after discharge, a person might still be described as a &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;, although one who had been discharged. Similarly, we think the reference to amounts received &ldquo;by the bankrupt&rdquo; in section 68 does not preclude section 68 from applying to amounts applicable to the period prior to the date of bankruptcy. In that regard, we submit the narrow view of the language taken by Mr. Justice Ground in <EM>Riel</EM>, for example, was incorrect.</P>
<P>91. In <EM>Cole</EM>, at paragraph 35, Registrar Hill observed that the court in <EM>Landry</EM> had noted that, &ldquo;(T)here was nothing in the language of section 68 which would restrict its application to the time frame between the date of bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge. What is important, in the view of the Ontario Court of Appeal, is the nature of the property in question, not the period of time in which it is acquired or received.&rdquo; As previously observed, the current version of section 68 now contains such a restriction.</P>
<P>92. Finally, on the issue of timing, Registrar Hill said the following at paragraph 38:
<QUOTE><P>In my opinion, the purpose of s. 68 is to allow a trustee access to a bankrupt's income for the benefit of the bankrupt's creditors. Where monies to be received by the bankrupt can properly be characterized as &ldquo;income&rdquo;, I see no reason to artificially deny access merely because the income will be received after discharge. The important point to consider is &ldquo;when was the income earned&rdquo; and not &ldquo;when was it received&rdquo;. Accountants have understood the &ldquo;accrual method&rdquo; of accounting for centuries. The same principals [sic] apply here. &ldquo;Income&rdquo; earned prior to bankruptcy is income earned at a time when the bankrupt owed a contractual obligation to the creditors to pay the debts owed to them. &ldquo;Income&rdquo; earned during bankruptcy is income earned during a period where a statutory duty under s. 68 may exist to contribute some of that income towards the estate for the benefit of the creditors. It would simply be wrong to allow a bankrupt to escape his or her obligations where by design or circumstance receipt of the income is delayed until after discharge. Section 68 as it now reads avoids that result.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>

In this case, the facts were very similar to ours and practically identical to <EM>Neufeld</EM>, in that the bankrupt had a son who was legally blind. Registrar Herauf referred to the <EM>Neufeld</EM> and <EM>Sobieski</EM> decisions and decided to follow <EM>Sobieski</EM>. He accordingly found that the refunds to be paid would be property of the bankrupt estate and not the disabled child. In <EM>Nixon</EM>, there was no discussion of whether the tax refund could be considered &ldquo;income&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;property&rdquo;, nor was there any reference to <EM>Marzetti, Wallace or Ramgotra</EM>. Neither <EM>Hynes</EM> nor <EM>Cole</EM> were referred to the Registrar. Also, there was no discussion of provincial exemptions which could apply by reason of section 67(1)(b).</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>T.A.H., also cited as Henderson</EM> (2003)</UNDER></TI>
<P>94. In <CASEREF><SOC>Re H. (T.A.)</SOC></CASEREF>, sometimes also cited as <CASEREF><SOC>Re Henderson</SOC><YEAR>2003</YEAR><CITE>ABQB 877</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 16</BOLD>, Registrar Waller of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench considered facts very similar to ours and <EM>Neufeld</EM>. He observed, at paragraph 4:
<QUOTE><P>Unlike other tax credits, the disability tax credit is not dependant on the taxpayer producing receipts for actual expenses. The credit is based on a formula and the tax credit is generated from the income of the parent who is wholly supporting the child.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>95. In <CASEREF><SOC>Re H. (T.A.)</SOC></CASEREF>, neither the trustee nor the bankrupt were represented by legal counsel. There was no consideration of whether the income tax refunds were &ldquo;income&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Indeed, there was no reference to section 68 of the BIA at all. He was referred to the decisions in <EM>Neufeld, Nixon, Sobieski</EM> and <EM>Burton</EM> but not <EM>Marzetti, Landry, Hynes</EM> or <EM>Cole</EM>.</P>
<P>96. At paragraph 16 of his reasons, Registrar Waller observed that under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, certain payments are exempted by law from the operation of the BIA, such as GST credits. However, he noted: &ldquo;the fact the disability tax credits are not specifically exempted by operation of law did not end the matter. For example, damages for pain and suffering to a bankrupt have long been recognized as not forming part of his or her estate&rdquo; (paragraph 16). In this respect, we suggest he was entirely correct.</P>
<P>97. In the result, Registrar Waller found that the tax credit was not personal to the person disabled, but the property of the taxpayer who supported that disabled person. And while he referred to the old English decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Beckham v. Drake</SOC></CASEREF>, which enunciated the principle that damages for pain and suffering are not available to creditors, he did not analyze or apply it.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Bolz</EM> (2004)</UNDER></TI>
<P>98. <CASEREF><SOC>Re: Bolz</SOC><YEAR>2004</YEAR><CITE>BCSC 1702</CITE></CASEREF> was a decision of Mr. Justice Romilly of the British Columbia Supreme Court, and is attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 17</BOLD>. In <EM>Bolz</EM>, the bankrupt had applied for disability tax credits after the date of his discharge and received a refund. The funds in question arose from both the pre and post-bankruptcy tax returns and the disability tax credit reassessment. Ignoring for the purpose of these submissions the issue pertaining to an agreement signed by the bankrupt in favour of the trustee directing that post-bankruptcy refunds be paid into the estate, which he found was of no force or effect, what is of interest in this decision is the court's approach to the pre and post-bankruptcy tax refunds.</P>
<P>99. With respect to the pre-bankruptcy tax refunds, Mr. Justice Romilly simply stated that section 71(2) of the BIA [now section 71] applied and these refunds vested in the trustee.</P>
<P>100. With respect to the post-bankruptcy tax refunds, Mr. Justice Romilly considered the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, which held that a post-bankruptcy income tax refund retained its character as wages for the purposes of section 68 of the Act. He then turned to a consideration of the disability tax credit cases, including <EM>Neufeld, Sobieski, Nixon</EM> and <EM>Henderson (T.A.H.)</EM>. Neither the <EM>Hynes</EM> nor <EM>Cole</EM> decisions were presented to His Lordship.</P>
<P>101. In the result, Mr. Justice Romilly read <EM>Marzetti</EM> very narrowly, in our respectful submission, and found that <EM>Marzetti</EM> &ldquo;takes no position on the status of a pre-bankruptcy tax refund, but instead deals exclusively with a post-bankruptcy refund&rdquo; (paragraph 22). However, he followed <EM>Marzetti</EM> in finding that the &ldquo;income tax refund portion&rdquo; of the post-bankruptcy tax return retained its character as income for the purposes of section 68, and could be accessed by the trustee only by means of an application pursuant to section 68.</P>
<P>102. Mr. Justice Romilly then dealt separately with the &ldquo;disability tax credit portion&rdquo;, that is, the portion of the refunds that arose as a result of the claims for disability tax credits. He found that the &ldquo;tax credit refund&rdquo; representing the pre-bankruptcy years formed part of the property of the bankrupt and vested in the trustee. He did not consider any provincial exemptions which may apply to these refunds, if they were to be characterized as &ldquo;wages&rdquo;. Perhaps that is because he decided, in regards to the post-bankruptcy disability tax credit refund, that they were not &ldquo;wages&rdquo;. He drew a distinction between the post-bankruptcy tax refund that was considered in <EM>Marzetti</EM> and the post-bankruptcy disability tax credit refund before him. In his view, the DTC refund stemmed not from an &ldquo;overpayment of wages&rdquo;, but from a disability tax credit. He saw this as an important distinction &ldquo;as this credit is considered by the CCRA to be a non-refundable, fixed credit to aid those living with a disability or caring for individuals with a disability&rdquo;, (paragraph 31) He gave no consideration to the fact that the refund which arose as a result of the disability tax credit being claimed was a return of income on which the bankrupt had previously paid tax. Respectfully, we think his conclusion on this point was incorrect.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Bowerbank-Buckley</EM> (2007)</UNDER></TI>
<P>103. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Bowerbank-Buckley</SOC><CITE>[2007] O.J. No. 5722</CITE></CASEREF>, was a decision of Deputy Registrar Diamond of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and is attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 18</BOLD>. In this case, he was applying the <EM>Landry</EM> versions of sections 67 and 68. There were two cases before him, both concerning bankrupts who were parents of a disabled child and who, after being discharged from their bankruptcies, became aware they were entitled to disability tax credits for periods prior to, during and after their respective bankruptcies. In other words, the facts were substantially the same as the case at bar.</P>
<P>104. Registrar Diamond clearly understood the issue before him. At paragraph 4, he said:
<QUOTE><P>The question at issue is how are the funds to be characterized in the context of the bankruptcy and discharge therefrom. There are three possible answers: the first is that the funds are property of a third party and held in trust, and are thus exempt property pursuant to section 67(1)(a) of the [BIA] and do not vest in the trustee; the second is that they are property of the bankrupt's estate, as defined in section 2 and set out in sections 67 and 71 of the BIA and vest in the trustee in bankruptcy for distribution to the bankrupt's creditors; or third, the funds are income of the bankrupt and thus should be dealt with pursuant to section 68 of the BIA.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>105. On the question of whether the refunds were property of a third party [the child] and held in trust, Registrar Diamond agreed with Registrar Waller in <EM>Henderson (T.A.H.)</EM> that these funds were not held in trust for the disabled child. He spent some time discussing section 67(2) of the BIA and statutory deemed trusts and concluded that under the relevant provisions of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, there was no deemed trust for refunds payable as a result of claiming a disability tax credit.</P>
<P>106. Registrar Diamond was also of the view that the disability tax credit provisions in the ITA did not create a &ldquo;trust proper&rdquo;. He stated, correctly in our view, that a clear legislative intent was required for the creation of a deemed trust and what the ITA provision did was reduce the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer. &ldquo;It does not stipulate how the resulting tax savings are to be spent or whom they are to be spent on&rdquo; (paragraph 12). He had also earlier noted in his decision, at paragraph 9, that &ldquo;one of the main objections to labelling refund amounts arising from this credit as &lsquo;trust funds&rsquo; has been that parents or guardians do not need to account for their use of the funds and are permitted to simply incorporate the money into their household finances.&rdquo;</P>
<P>107. On whether the income tax refunds arising from the disability tax credits for the pre-bankruptcy period were &ldquo;income&rdquo; or &ldquo;property&rdquo;, Registrar Diamond regarded himself as bound by <EM>Landry</EM>. In his view, the Court of Appeal in <EM>Landry</EM> had concluded that the damages awarded after bankruptcy from a &ldquo;chose in action&rdquo; for wrongful dismissal that occurred before bankruptcy were not property, but income. However, respectfully, we think he misreads <EM>Landry</EM> when he views that decision as &ldquo;in effect, dealing with the funds that flow from employment and income on a receipt basis, not an accrual basis&rdquo; (paragraph 17). He read <EM>Landry</EM> as suggesting that the fact entitlement to the tax credit in the case before him arose prior to the bankruptcy was not determinative of whether the funds are property or income, and this conclusion was &ldquo;somewhat controversial&rdquo; (paragraph 16).</P>
<P>108. With respect to Registrar Diamond, we do not think that was the court's conclusion in <EM>Landry</EM> at all. We further think Registrar Diamond's suggestion that if income earned prior to bankruptcy had been deposited into the bankrupt's bank account the day before the assignment, then those funds would have been considered property, not income, was incorrect. If income earned prior to bankruptcy had been deposited into the bankrupt's bank account the day before the assignment, those funds would likely still retain their character as income and presumably be subject to provincial exemptions if section 68 did not apply. Of course, at the time <EM>Bowerbank-Buckley</EM> was decided, section 68 did apply to pre-bankruptcy income on the authority of <EM>Landry</EM>.</P>
<P>109. We submit Registrar Diamond was correct in his conclusion that the Court of Appeal in <EM>Landry</EM> had decided that it was clear from <EM>Wallace</EM> and <EM>Marzetti</EM> that section 68 applied to wages attributable to the period before bankruptcy &ldquo;because of the nature of the property in question, regardless of the timing of the acquisition of the property or for the fact that the payment is made in a lump sum&rdquo;, (paragraph 19)</P>
<P>110. Finally, Registrar Diamond considered the nature of a disability tax credit and considered the reasons of Mr. Justice Romilly in <EM>Bolz</EM>. We have earlier cited, at page 6 of this brief, his quotation of Professor David Duff in that author's McGill Law Journal article <EM>Disability and the Income Tax</EM> and his view of the true character of a disability tax credit.</P>
<P>111. Registrar Diamond went on to observe at paragraph 28 of his reasons, citing with approval another article by a different professor, the following:
<QUOTE><P>The motivation behind the DTC is ... to allow disabled people and those caring for them <UNDER>to keep more of their taxable income in light of the added expenses that they incur</UNDER>. The fact that these expenses are not always itemizable and therefore are not always covered by the medical expense tax credit necessitates the creation of a fixed credit. This should not be interpreted, however, as signifying that the DTC is not connected to income or to expenses, but rather merely indicates its remedial nature. From this one can conclude that the DTC should be treated the same way as a tax refund and included in the income of the bankrupt. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>112. Accordingly, he found that, because the purpose of the DTC was to augment the income of the parent of a disabled child, it was akin to income and should therefore, following <EM>Marzetti</EM>, and <EM>Landry</EM>, be dealt with under section 68 of the BIA as income and not section 67 as property.</P>
<P>113. Registrar Diamond then, in our respectful view, made something of a hard left turn and, in so doing, misapplied the principles in <EM>Landry</EM>. Registrar Diamond held that if the accounting for these refunds was to be done on a receipt basis and not an accrual basis, then these funds were not &ldquo;income of a bankrupt&rdquo; within the meaning of section 68 as it then read, as the taxpayer had been discharged from bankruptcy before there was any awareness of the right to and receipt of the disability tax credit. He then held that the funds were properly payable to the bankrupt to be kept by her to pay for her children's needs.</P>
<P>114. Respectfully, we think that Registrar Diamond was quite correct that refunds generated by disability tax credits should be treated as &ldquo;income&rdquo; and not &ldquo;property&rdquo;. However, we do not agree that <EM>Landry</EM> expected the accounting for such refunds to be done a receipt basis and we submit that any such refunds attributable to the period prior to bankruptcy or during bankruptcy were &ldquo;income&rdquo; to be addressed by the trustee, based on the version of section 68 as it read at the time.</P></BLOCK4>

<P>116. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Ford</SOC><YEAR>2009</YEAR><CITE>53 CBR (5th) 298</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 20</BOLD>, was a decision of Registrar Cregan of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. We think this decision was very well reasoned and it has been frequently cited.</P>
<P>117. In the case before him, the facts were substantially similar to this case, except that Ms. Ford had a disabled mother.</P>
<P>118. Registrar Cregan began his decision by reviewing the legislative history of section 68, noting the amendments which had been made to section 68 but not yet proclaimed at the time of his decision. He also discussed the character of the disability tax credit which, in the case before him, was sometimes called the &ldquo;caregiver amount&rdquo;. He succinctly described this credit as follows, at paragraphs 7 and 8 of his decision:
<QUOTE><P>In substance both the federal and the Nova Scotia government have decided as a matter of social policy that taxpayers who in their home look after their disabled or aged parents of limited income should be helped with this tax credit which reduces their annual income tax assessments. It is something they are entitled to annually.</P>
<P>The amount is a non-refundable tax credit. A percentage of this credit is deducted from the tax payable. ... The taxpayer can only use the credit to reduce taxes otherwise payable. Any portion of the credit not needed for this purpose is lost. The credit may result in a taxpayer receiving a refund, his or her payroll deductions or quarterly payments being, with the credit, more than needed to pay the taxes assessed. There is clear law, as will be noted later, as to how such refunds will be treated year by year. However, in the present case the refunds arise from later reassessments. What was received is the total of what would have been received had the amount been claimed each year.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>119. Registrar Cregan began his analysis by reviewing the decision in <EM>Marzetti</EM> and noted that it concluded the refund should be considered as &ldquo;wages&rdquo; because it was a return of money which the bankrupt had earned as wages. &ldquo;It is the surplus remaining after taxes are assessed. <UNDER>This surplus is still wages</UNDER>, but is only received once it is no longer needed to pay any outstanding taxes&rdquo; (emphasis added) (paragraph 14).</P>
<P>120. Registrar Cregan also considered the <EM>Landry</EM> decision and found the case was authority for the point that section 68 as it then read applied to income which accrued prior to the bankruptcy but was not received by the time of discharge.</P>
<P>121. Registrar Cregan discussed the decisions in <EM>Bolz, Sobieski</EM> and <EM>Nixon</EM>, as well as <EM>Neufeld</EM>. He noted the trust analysis in <EM>Neufeld</EM> was generally not accepted. He was not inclined to follow the other cases because, in his view, the concern of the court in those decisions was to determine whether the credits were property of the bankrupts as opposed to someone else, namely the disabled person. In his view, that was not the problem before him. Rather, it was a contest between whether the refunds at issue were property of the bankrupt or part of the bankrupt's &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; or &ldquo;total income&rdquo; which, if so, must be processed under section 68 (paragraph 30).</P>
<P>122. He went on to say, at paragraph 37, that whether the funds in question were &ldquo;salary, wages or other remuneration&rdquo; under the old wording of section 68 or &ldquo;total income&rdquo; including &ldquo;all revenue of a bankrupt of whatever nature or source&rdquo; under the wording of section 68 before him, and earned or in some other way crystallized during the bankruptcy period and received during the bankruptcy or after discharge, they were to be distributed under section 68. In his view, this followed clearly from <EM>Marzetti</EM> and it further followed from <EM>Landry</EM> that this applied to funds earned or crystallized before bankruptcy, but not received until after the assignment was made.</P>
<P>123. Registrar Cregan then considered two questions (paragraph 39 and 40). The first was whether the disability tax credit or, as he described it, the &ldquo;caregiver amount&rdquo; fit within &ldquo;all revenue of a bankrupt or whatever nature or source&rdquo; and was thus part of &ldquo;total income&rdquo; under section 68. The second was whether <EM>Landry</EM> should be followed in saying that section 68 applies to funds earned, accrued or otherwise crystallized before the assignment in bankruptcy. He concluded that a wide and generous meaning should be given to what constitutes &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; under section 68. At paragraph 45, he said this:
<QUOTE><P>Does a reasonable meaning of &ldquo;income&rdquo; or &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; considered in the context of s. 68 include these caregiver amounts? I think it does. They arise from the personal circumstances of the bankrupt. They are accruing payments, available yearly, in recognition of certain social goals adopted by the ITA. They recognize extra efforts the taxpayer makes. They come in annually, are modest in amount, intended to help a family in its current needs. I appreciate that to receive the credit one must in fact be assessed income tax against which the credit is set off; otherwise the credit is lost, being non-refundable. However, I do not see this conditional entitlement detracts from its nature as income or revenue. The language of s. 68, particularly the words &ldquo;total&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rdquo;, and &ldquo;whatever nature or source&rdquo;, I think direct that the benefit of any doubt must be given in favour of including these credits as part of &lsquo;total income&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>124. As Registrar Cregan observed, if Ms. Ford had been receiving the allowance each year as each accrued, the benefit would have been reflected in the amount of tax she would have had to pay. It would be less. She would then receive a greater refund. Following <EM>Marzetti</EM>, that refund would be income under section 68. He did not think the fact that Ms. Ford did not receive the credits annually but rather as one lump sum made any difference, because he was satisfied that such amounts were revenue caught by section 68 &ldquo;whatever way it is delivered&rdquo;. He answered the first question in the affirmative.</P>
<P>125. As to the second question, and whether section 68 applied to funds earned, accrued or otherwise crystallized before assignment, he observed that if the unproclaimed amendment to section 68 [the amendment which came into force in 2009] was in effect, &ldquo;the task would be quite easy&rdquo; (paragraph 50). He observed the amended version of section 68 defined total income as including &ldquo;a bankrupt's revenues of whatever nature or from whatever source that are earned or received by the bankrupt between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge&rdquo;. Therefore, as he read what is now the current version of section 68, income which accrued or was earned before bankruptcy but not received between the date of bankruptcy and the date of discharge &ldquo;would apparently not be covered by section 68&rdquo;. He went on to say, &ldquo;I understand this amendment is intended to clarify the confused state of affairs with which I am now addressing.&rdquo; In the result, in the case before him, he followed <EM>Landry</EM> and found that income accrued before bankruptcy was subject to section 68. Whether the 2009 amendments to section 68 &ldquo;clarify the confused state of affairs&rdquo; or not is something this application addresses.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Potter</EM> (2010)</UNDER></TI>
<P>126. There remain to be discussed two bankruptcy cases decided by the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench. The first is <CASEREF><SOC>Re Potter</SOC><YEAR>2010</YEAR><CITE>MBQB 36</CITE></CASEREF>, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 21</BOLD>, another decision of Registrar Harrison. The case was concerned with disability tax credits claimed only for the years prior to bankruptcy. This case considered the <EM>Landry</EM> versions of sections 67 and 68. Registrar Harrison considered <EM>Marzetti</EM>, but said &ldquo;it must be remembered that <EM>Marzetti</EM> dealt only with post-bankruptcy tax refunds&rdquo; (paragraph 18).</P>
<P>127. Registrar Harrison considered the 2009 amendments to sections 67 and 68, but noted that the unamended versions (the <EM>Landry</EM> versions) were the versions applicable to the case before him. He then concluded, at paragraph 30, that &ldquo;revenue cannot be a tax rebate by definition, nor by the same standard can a tax refund be termed income; rather it is an overpayment of tax&rdquo;. With respect, this statement seems entirely wrong.</P>
<P>128. Registrar Harrison did refer to the decision of Registrar Cregan in <EM>Ford</EM>, but disagreed with his conclusion that section 68 applied to pre-bankruptcy amounts (paragraph 31). He also said at paragraph 32 that &ldquo;(T)he other issue not specifically addressed by Registrar Cregan is the present statutory inclusion of the term &lsquo;any refund owing to the bankrupt under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>&rsquo; in section 67 in the present amended BIA, and whether that represents a change in the applicable law to the time frame in question&rdquo;. With respect, Registrar Cregan did comment on the amendment to paragraph 67(1)(c), passed in 2007 and proclaimed in 2008, but not applicable to the case before him, at paragraph 47 of his decision, and observed that &ldquo;this would limit the application of his analysis in the future&rdquo;.</P>
<P>129. With respect to Registrar Lee and Registrar Cregan, section 67(1)(c) as it presently reads only specifically includes any refund owing to the bankrupt under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> &ldquo;<UNDER>in respect of</UNDER> the calendar year ... in which the bankrupt became a bankrupt&rdquo;. This language does <UNDER>not</UNDER> specifically include refunds owing to the bankrupt &ldquo;in respect of the years prior to the date of bankruptcy as &ldquo;property&rdquo; of the bankrupt.</P>
<P>130. As to the decision in <EM>Landry</EM>, Registrar Harrison simply said that he was not convinced that an Ontario appellate decision concerning an action for unjust dismissal was relevant to a Manitoba court dealing with a tax refund issue based on a disability tax credit (paragraph 33).</P>
<P>131. In the result, Registrar Harrison found that Mr. Potter's right to the tax refund &ldquo;was under his full control&rdquo; on the date of his assignment and therefore caught as &ldquo;property&rdquo; within section 67 and it did not possess the character of &ldquo;revenue in that these monies were never withheld by his employer from wages he was earning at this pre-bankruptcy time&rdquo; (paragraph 39). With respect, this decision seems wrong to us.</P>
<P>132. The decision of Registrar Lee was appealed and the appeal was heard by Mr. Justice Menzies [2010] MBQB 83, attached at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 22.</BOLD> In his reasons, Mr. Justice Menzies agreed with Registrar Harrison that the disability tax credit refund was &ldquo;property&rdquo; within the meaning of the BIA. However, he went on to consider whether the disability tax credit should be dealt with as property under section 67 or income subject to section 68. Mr. Justice Menzies referred to the description of the disability tax credit as income set out in <EM>Bowerbank-Buckley</EM>, and also the discussion of such refunds in <EM>Ford</EM>. He found the reasoning of the Registrar in those cases &ldquo;to be very persuasive&rdquo;. At paragraph 12, he said:
<QUOTE><P>The refund generated by the disability tax credit results in a rebate of tax paid or owing by the taxpayer. The tax paid or owing originates from the taxpayer's income. If in fact the taxpayer has not prepaid their tax, any outstanding tax liability is decreased. The fact the money is being returned to the taxpayer after already being received by the CRA does not, in my opinion, cause the funds to lose their status as income. The rebate is a process whereby the taxpayer is allowed to retain a greater portion of their taxable income in any given year in recognition of the unascertained expenses incurred as a caregiver for a disabled person.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>133. The report of Mr. Justice Menzies' decision is confusing because it states that the appeal was dismissed and the decision of Registrar Harrison was affirmed. However, he overruled Registrar Harrison on the question of whether the disability tax credit refunds were income or not; Justice Menzies found they were income and, in this, we think he was correct.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Gabrielle</EM> (2014)</UNDER></TI>
<P>134. <CASEREF><SOC>Re Gabrielle</SOC><YEAR>2014</YEAR><CITE>MBQB 77</CITE></CASEREF>, was another decision of Registrar Harrison and appears at <BOLD>Part 2, TAB 23</BOLD>. In this case, the disability tax credit claimed by the bankrupt pertained to her disabled mother. At paragraph 11, Registrar Harrison stated, &ldquo;The law on the characterization of tax refunds as property or income was recently clarified by amendments to the BIA&rdquo;. He then set out, at paragraph 11, an extract from <EM>Bennett on Bankruptcy</EM>. In that extract, Mr. Bennett stated:
<QUOTE><P>This new section [section 67(1)(c) as it reads today] clearly indicates that for the bankrupt's tax refund for the calendar year the assignment is filed, it is an asset that vests with the trustee unless one of the two exceptions outlined in BIA ss.67(1)(c)(i) or (ii) exist. Currently, section 118.2 of the ITA [s. 118.3?] does not indicate that the DTC [disability tax credit] is not subject to the operation of the BIA. Therefore, if it can be determined that the DTC relates to the year of bankruptcy <UNDER>or a prior year</UNDER>, it will vest with the trustee. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>135. With respect to Mr. Bennett, <UNDER>nowhere</UNDER> in section 67(1)(c), as it now reads, does it refer to refunds owing to the bankrupt in respect of years prior to the date of bankruptcy. Furthermore, if the refund is &ldquo;property&rdquo; and one of the other exceptions in section 67(1)(a) or (b) applies because, for example, all or part of it is exempt, then we submit those provisions would still apply. What is also not considered by Mr. Bennett or Registrar Harrison is whether sub-paragraph 67(1)(c)(i) [&ldquo;is not subject to the operation of this Act&rdquo;] could exclude from &ldquo;property&rdquo; certain refunds, even in the year of bankruptcy, which are either exempt as wages or not subject to the operation of the Act because they are akin to an award for pain and suffering, that is, amounts payable only by reason of the physical or mental disability of a person.</P>
<P>136. In the result, Registrar Harrison concluded that the law with regard to all income tax refunds, including DTC's, was clarified by the amendments to section 67 and, in respect of assignments filed after July 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2008, all such refunds, including all pre-bankruptcy personal tax refunds, were &ldquo;property&rdquo; available for creditors.</P>
<P>137. With respect, we think that Registrar Harrison's failure to consider that the amendment to section 67(1)(c) only specifically addressed tax refunds payable &ldquo;in respect of the year of bankruptcy and his failure to consider the possibility that such property can still be &ldquo;wages&rdquo;, and subject to any provincial exemptions for wages, or that such refund could otherwise &ldquo;not be subject to the operation of the Act&rdquo;, makes this decision of limited value.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Pain and Suffering Cases</UNDER></TI>
<P>138. We now turn to a brief review of the cases which address damages arising from physical or mental suffering of the debtor. The leading case is <CASEREF><SOC>Re: Hollister</SOC><CITE>[1926] 7 CBR 629</CITE></CASEREF>, which appears at <BOLD>Part 2 TAB 24,</BOLD> a decision of Mr. Justice Fisher of what was then the Ontario Supreme Court. He held that monies recovered by an undischarged debtor for personal injuries sustained by him was not &ldquo;property&rdquo; divisible among his creditors under the <EM>Bankruptcy Act</EM>. We have previously quoted his often-cited statement of this well-known principle in our review of <EM>Neufeld</EM> above.</P>
<P>139. Other cases frequently cited, and attached to <BOLD>Part 2</BOLD>, are the following:
<P1>(a) <CASEREF><SOC>Eggen v. Grayson</SOC><YEAR>1956</YEAR><CITE>36 CBR 72</CITE></CASEREF>, a decision of Mr. Justice Boyd McBride of the Alberta Supreme Court&mdash;<BOLD>TAB 25</BOLD></P1>

<P1>(d) <CASEREF><SOC>Re Conforti</SOC><CITE>[2015] O.J. No. 1986</CITE><COURTJUR>Ontario C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>&mdash;<BOLD>TAB 28</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(e) <CASEREF><SOC>Re: Rice</SOC><YEAR>2016</YEAR><CITE>NBQB 134</CITE></CASEREF>, a decision of Deputy Registrar Evans of the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench&mdash;<BOLD>TAB 29</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>140. <EM>Eggen</EM> was a case where the debtor's action was based on malicious prosecution and sought damages for pain, humiliation and injury to his reputation. In <EM>Ritenberg</EM>, the debtor was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sought damages for personal injuries and pain and suffering. Both cases referred with approval to <EM>Hollister</EM> and reached the conclusion such claims and damages were not &ldquo;property&rdquo; available to creditors.</P>
<P>141. In <CASEREF><SOC>Holley v. Gifford Smith Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered a situation where a bankrupt's action for wrongful dismissal vested as property in the trustee. The action included a claim for damages for mental distress. The court decided that damages for mental distress were personal to the bankrupt and &ldquo;it is not the policy of the law to convert into money for the creditors the mental or physical anguish of the debtor&rdquo;.</P>
<P>142. In<EM>Conforti</EM>, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered various heads of compensation received by a bankrupt arising from a motor vehicle accident. The bankrupt was permanently disabled and unable to continue to work. He received income assistance, a lump sum settlement of statutory accident benefits and various amounts of damages in settlement of his personal injury claim. The Court of Appeal concluded that damages for future care and housekeeping should not be included as &ldquo;income&rdquo; of the bankrupt and were not otherwise available to the trustee. The court held such amounts were damages that were personal to the appellant and bore a close relationship to damages on account of pain and suffering, and noted there was extensive support for the proposition that damages for pain and suffering do not fall under sections 67 or 68 of the BIA.</P>
<P>143. In <CASEREF><SOC>Re Rice</SOC></CASEREF>, the bankrupt had received a lump sum payment from the New Brunswick version of the Workers' Compensation Board. The court referred to <EM>Ritenberg, Holley</EM> and <EM>Conforti</EM>. Registrar Evans then observed that New Brunswick courts have recognized common law damage awards for lost opportunity arising from personal injuries and also noted that the lump sum received from Ms. Rice was statutorily characterized by the New Brunswick <EM>Workers' Compensation Act</EM> as a loss of opportunity for permanent physical impairment. This was a statutory method of compensation for her physical loss arising from a workplace injury. The court found this loss was personal in nature to Ms. Rice and, accordingly, it was not an asset for purposes of the BIA. &ldquo;To hold otherwise would, in my view, convert into money for the creditors the physical anguish of the debtor thereby contravening the stated policy of the law.&rdquo; (paragraph 20)</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VII">VII. <UNDER>CONCLUSIONS</UNDER></TI>
<P>144. Having considered the legislative history of sections 67 and 68 of the BIA, the policies and objectives of the BIA which include the financial rehabilitation of the bankrupt, and the decided cases and, in particular, <EM>Marzetti, Landry, Hynes, Cole, Bowerbank-Buckley</EM> and <EM>Ford</EM>, and the &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases beginning with <EM>Hollister</EM>, we have reached the following conclusions:</P>
<P>(1) An income tax refund which results from claiming a disability tax credit is &ldquo;income&rdquo;.</P>
<P>(2) If a disability tax credit was claimed in relation to a person who is financially dependant on the bankrupt, the refund payable to the bankrupt is not held in trust by the bankrupt for the disabled dependant. There is no statutory deemed trust applicable to refunds arising from disability tax credits, nor is there a &ldquo;true&rdquo; trust created. It is the bankrupt's asset.</P>
<P>(3) It is the character of the asset and not the accident of timing which determines whether or not the refund is subject to the provisions of the BIA. Language such as &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo; the year of bankruptcy or &ldquo;earned&rdquo; during the period of bankruptcy is a clear indication to us that it is the taxation year to which the refund relates that is relevant, even if the refunds were not actually paid until after the date of discharge.</P>
<P>(4) Section 68 of the BIA as it now reads is applicable only to &ldquo;total income&rdquo; which is <UNDER>earned</UNDER> OR <UNDER>received</UNDER> by the bankrupt between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge. The &lsquo;or&rdquo; is important. If an income tax refund becomes payable to the bankrupt after his or her discharge but pertains to (was <UNDER>earned</UNDER> during) the period of bankruptcy, then section 68 applies, unless it is a refund for the post-bankruptcy portion of the year of bankruptcy, in which case section 67(1)(c) applies. Likewise, if a pre-bankruptcy income tax refund was <UNDER>received</UNDER> during bankruptcy, section 68 applies.</P>
<P>(5) With respect to &ldquo;total income&rdquo; [income tax refunds] earned or received by the bankrupt during the period of his or her bankruptcy, the provincial exemptions applicable to wages do not apply, because subsection 68(2)(a), which defines &ldquo;total income&rdquo;, specifically states &ldquo;despite paragraphs 67(1)(b) and (b.3)&rdquo;. However, under section 68, it would be open to a bankrupt to argue that all or most of these refunds should be left in his or her hands given their family situation and the needs of their disabled dependant.</P>
<P>(6) Although the 2009 amendment to section 68 has effectively made section 68 a &ldquo;complete code&rdquo; only with respect to revenues earned or received during the period of bankruptcy, it still does not change the character of the asset. An income tax refund payable by reason of a disability tax credit claim is still &ldquo;income&rdquo;. Accordingly, the &ldquo;pre-amendment&rdquo; situation described in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, and based on the reasoning in <CASEREF><SOC>Industrial Acceptance Corp. v. Lalonde</SOC></CASEREF>, applies to income tax refunds which have retained their character as &ldquo;wages&rdquo; for the period prior to the date of bankruptcy and were either paid and still held by the bankrupt at the date of bankruptcy or received sometime after the date of discharge, i.e. they are not &ldquo;received&rdquo; during the bankruptcy. To the extent they are not caught by section 68, these pre-bankruptcy refunds now vest in the trustee by reason of sections 67 and 71 of the BIA, but the provincial exemptions apply. In other words, the vesting of these refunds in the trustee does not preclude or overcome the application of provincial exemption laws. The trustee is unable to retain more than the exigible piece; the balance of these pre-bankruptcy refunds must be returned to the bankrupt as exempt property. Put another way, given the 2009 amendment to section 68, the &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; approach described in <EM>Ramgotra</EM>, and discussed in the Klotz article, is now the law as far as pre-bankruptcy earnings or wages not &ldquo;received&rdquo; during bankruptcy are concerned.</P>
<P>(7) Under Alberta law, the exemptions applicable to wages are contained in section 81 of the <EM>Civil Enforcement Act</EM> and sections 39 to 40 of the <EM>Civil Enforcement Regulation</EM>, copies of which are attached to <BOLD>Part 1, TAB R and TAB S.</BOLD> The employment earnings exemption is calculated on a monthly basis. The actual employment earnings exemption is the minimum exemption [$800 plus $200 per dependant] plus one-half of the amount by which the debtor's net pay exceeds the minimum exemption up to the maximum exemption [$2,400 plus $200 per dependant]. Therefore, assuming these pre-bankruptcy refunds were paid after the date of discharge, we think it would be necessary for the trustee to assess the bankrupt's average monthly income during the pre-bankruptcy years for which these tax refunds were received and, treating the refunds received as the last dollars earned, calculate what portion of the refund is exigible and payable to the trustee, and what portion should remain in the bankrupt's hands as exempt. Furthermore, with respect to &ldquo;wages&rdquo; [income tax refunds] attributable to the pre-bankruptcy years and not &ldquo;received&rdquo; during bankruptcy, we think there is an argument that section 67(1)(b) should be not limited to statutory exemptions. There are other grounds on which such income may be exempt from execution or seizure &ldquo;under any laws applicable in the province&rdquo;. Following the &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases, it could be argued that none of these pre-bankruptcy refunds should be available to the trustee, because they are similar, in policy and purpose, to amounts paid to alleviate pain and suffering such as housekeeping or personal care. In the case at bar, the only reason the disability tax credits were available, and the only reason these additional income tax refunds were generated, is because of the disability of the bankrupt's child. If her child was not disabled, there would be no credits and no refunds, and no additional assets available to the trustee. If it is not the policy of the law to convert into money for creditors the mental or physical anguish of a debtor, how could it be the policy of the law to convert into money for a parent's creditors the mental or physical anguish of her child?</P>
<P>(8) As to the refund owing to the bankrupt in respect of the year of bankruptcy, section 67(1)(c) now includes the refund <UNDER>for that year only</UNDER> as &ldquo;property&rdquo;. However, the exception to this provision contained in subsection 67(1)(c)(i) [&ldquo;except the portion that is not subject to the operation of this Act&rdquo;], must be given some meaning. We agree there is nothing in the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> which would exempt refunds arising from disability tax credits. However, we do not think this is the end of the analysis. The income tax refund received for the year of bankruptcy is still &ldquo;income&rdquo; and at least the exemptions under provincial law should apply and, as discussed above, those could include both statutory exemptions and assets not available to creditors as a matter of public policy.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. Introduction and Issues</TI>
<P>1. On October 3, 2017, the Court appointed Miles Davison LLP as <EM>amicus curiae</EM> (the &ldquo;Amicus&rdquo;) for the purpose of preparing and making submissions to the Court at a special application before a Registrar regarding,
<QUOTE><P>the application of principles of law and equity, including without limitation, the interpretation and application of current statutory provisions, to the facts and circumstances pertaining to the disability tax credits claimed by the bankrupt by reason of her child's disability, and the fund of $20,339.82 (the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo;) arising therefrom, which Fund is presently held in trust by the Trustee, for the purpose of deciding the person or persons entitled to such Fund or portions thereof.</P></QUOTE>
(the &ldquo;Directions&rdquo;)</P>
<P>2. The Amicus's brief states that &ldquo;Registrar Prowse considered it necessary and appropriate that the legal issues raised in this matter be researched and briefed by an impartial legal advisor for the assistance of this Honourable Court.&rdquo; And, in that respect, the Amicus produced a lengthy brief summarizing the relevant facts, analyzing the relevant legislation and analyzing a number of cases that dealt with disability tax credit (&ldquo;DTC&rdquo;) income tax refunds.</P>
<P>3. The Alberta Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals (&ldquo;AAIRP&rdquo;), the professional association of Licensed Insolvency Trustees (&ldquo;Trustees&rdquo;) in Alberta applied to appear as intervenor, file its own brief and make its own submissions because:
<P1>a. its members will be affected by the decision facing the Court;</P1>
<P1>b. it has special expertise and insight to bring to the issues facing the Court; and</P1>
<P1>c. the Trustee has no resources in the Estate to fund representation, so the interests of Trustees, generally, would not be fully protected without the involvement of the AAIRP as intervenor.</P1></P>
<P>4. On December 8, 2017, AAIRP was granted status as intervenor.</P>
<P>5. The Amicus, in accordance with the Directions, considered who, as between the Trustee and Ms. Chomistek, was entitled to all or part of the Fund and concluded that Ms. Chomistek was.</P>
<P>6. Despite the Amicus setting out the current state of the law, and its agreement with the reasoning in <EM>Hynes, Cole</EM> and <EM>Ford</EM>, the Amicus reached its conclusions using a different type of analysis of the pre-bankruptcy DTC income tax refunds and two legal positions not supported by the current state of the law, namely: (a) the applicability of provincial wage exemptions and (b) the relevance of the &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases.</P>
<P>7. Notwithstanding that AAIRP disagrees with the Amicus' conclusions, it does agree with the Amicus that:
<P1>a. An income tax refund is an asset of a bankrupt;</P1>
<P1>b. The tax refund for the year of bankruptcy is property of the bankrupt that vests with the Trustee per s. 67(1)(c) of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM> (the &ldquo;BIA&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>c. In this specific case, the pre-bankruptcy income tax refunds arising from the DTCs are &ldquo;income&rdquo; as it is derived from the bankrupt's employment&mdash;wages;</P1>
<P1>d. Section 68 of the BIA applies to pre-bankruptcy income tax refunds received during bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy income tax refunds (other than the year of the bankruptcy) payable to the bankrupt while in bankruptcy; and</P1>
<P1>e. The DTC claimed by a bankrupt in respect of a dependent is the bankrupt's asset and not held in trust for the disabled dependent.</P1></P>
<P>8. AAlRP's role in this matter is to ensure that the proper analysis is used so that Trustees can discharge their duties under the BIA, namely s. 68, and not have to consider unnecessary issues.</P>
<P>9. This brief utilizes the Amicus' cases where applicable and does not re-cite them herein unless quoting a specific passage.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. The Tax Refund for the Year of Bankruptcy</TI>
<P>10. Ms. Chomistek received an income tax refund in respect of tax years 2006 to 2013 (the year of bankruptcy) totaling $20,339.82. A table breaking down the tax refund per tax year is located at paragraph 13 of the Amicus' brief.</P>
<P>11. Of that amount, $2,879.36 relates to the pre- and post- bankruptcy tax returns filed in respect of the year of bankruptcy, 2013. The remaining $17,460.46 is for the tax years 2006 to 2012, the pre-bankruptcy period.</P>
<P>12. Section 67(1)(c) states that &ldquo;any refund owing to the bankrupt under the Income Tax Act in respect of the calendar year&mdash;or the fiscal year of the bankrupt if different from the calendar year&mdash;in which the bankrupt became a bankrupt&rdquo; is property of the bankrupt and divisible among her creditors. There are two exceptions to the rule pertaining to the tax refund issued for the year of bankruptcy: (a) that portion that is not subject to the operation of the BIA; and (b) money captured by a garnishee summons issued under the <EM>Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act</EM>.</P>
<P>13. In this case, Ms. Chomistek's 2013 income tax refunds fall within s.67(1)(c) and vest in the Trustee. Neither of the exceptions apply.</P>
<P>14. This then leaves the pre-bankruptcy tax refunds arising from the DTCs. AAlRP's analysis of this issue starts with a review of the different ways that Courts have addressed this issue. After which, this Brief will consider the 2 issues in which AAlRP's analysis is different than the Amicus and the recommended practice for Trustees to handle these types of situations going forward.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. Case Analysis re Bankrupt's Pre-Bankruptcy DTC Income Tax Refunds</TI>
<P>15. Per Justice lacobucci at the Supreme Court of Canada (&ldquo;SCC&rdquo;) and Justice Major at the Alberta Court of Appeal, tax refunds can be generated from a number of sources of income, including wages. Whether tax refunds can be characterized as wages, &ldquo;depends on the nature of the refund&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Marzetti v. Marzetti</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 SCR 765</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Marzetti</EM>&rdquo;) at paras. 78 to 80, Part 2, Tab 1 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>16. Just as lacobucci J. did in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, we accept that Ms. Chomistek's income tax refunds for the tax years 2006 to 2012, the pre-bankruptcy period, arose from her wages.</P>
<P>17. How should Ms. Chomistek's pre-bankruptcy DTC income tax refunds be treated? The Amicus' states that there is no consistent conclusion that can be reached from the reported cases which have considered DTC income tax refunds and while that may be true, the decisions reached by the various courts in matters of DTCs and <EM>other pre-bankruptcy earnings</EM>, and their reasoning, can be separated into a few different categories.</P>
<P>18. Our analysis starts with the 3 categories identified in Robert A. Klotz's paper, &ldquo;Who Gets the Bankrupt's Pre-Bankruptcy Earnings?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Klotz&rdquo;) produced at Part 2, Tab 12 of the Amicus' brief: (a) the &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; approach; (b) the &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; approach; and (c) the &ldquo;s. 68&rdquo; approach.
<QUOTE><P>What makes this topic confusing is the utilization by the courts, in different, cases, of three separate conceptual treatments of pre-bankruptcy earnings.</P></QUOTE>
The version of Mr. Klotz's paper produced in the Amicus' brief has some formatting and typographical errors making it difficult to ascertain the 3 approaches. A clean version from Mr. Klotz's website is attached at <BOLD>TAB 1</BOLD> of this brief.</P>
<P>19. Building from the foundation of Mr. Klotz's approaches, I have identified 2 other categories: (d) the &ldquo;pre-67/post-68&rdquo; approach; and (e) the &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; approach. Attached as Schedules &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo; and &ldquo;E&rdquo; to this Brief, I have categorized those cases listed in Mr. Klotz's paper, the cases provided by the Amicus, cases relied on within the Amicus' cases and a few cases that had not been previously considered.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Exemption&rdquo; Approach</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. Mr. Klotz's first approach is the &ldquo;Exemption&rdquo; Approach and the application of provincial exemption laws to analyze the priority issues affecting funds caught in a priority dispute between a bankruptcy and spousal or child support garnishments and paid into Court. In these cases, the Trustee had priority over the non-exempt portion and the wife's garnishment for support payments took priority over the remaining exempt amounts.</P>
<P>21. These cases and their reasoning are not applicable to DTC income tax refund cases, so I do not find the &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; approach relevant to Ms. Chomistek.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Vesting&rdquo; Approach</UNDER></TI>
<P>22. The second approach, the &ldquo;Vesting&rdquo; Approach, is the line of authority that <EM>pre-bankruptcy</EM> earnings, and anything derived therefrom, accrue to the Trustee without limitation.
<QUOTE><P>These cases are based on the view that BIA s. 68 applies only to post-bankruptcy wages, and that consequently pre-bankruptcy wages constitute property of the bankrupt estate, vesting entirely in the trustee, for distribution among creditors. <EM>The rationale for this view is that the pre-bankruptcy wages ought to accrue to the creditors who presumably went unpaid, or whose debts were presumably increased, as a result of the inability of the debtor to access those wages before the bankruptcy</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Klotz at p.2</P1></P>
<P>23. Mr. Klotz goes on to say that,
<QUOTE><P>The technical justification for this view is that s. 68 applies by its terms to the revenue of the &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;&mdash;since the status of &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; begins only upon the date of bankruptcy, the section is applicable only for the period following that date, when there is indeed a bankrupt.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>24. As you can see from Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;, this was an approach used <EM>pre-Marzetti</EM> based on the strict wording of s. 68 at the time, and then by a few cases post-<EM>Marzetti</EM> on the basis that <EM>Marzetti</EM> stood for the position that s. 68 only applied to post-bankruptcy revenue.</P>
<P>25. With specific reference to DTC income tax refund cases, we find that the majority of courts west of Ontario have applied this approach notwithstanding the wording of s. 68 at the time of those decisions. I believe the reasoning for this line of DTC income tax refund cases traces back to 1997 when <CASEREF><SOC>Marzetti and Sobieski</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>45 C.B.R. (32) 272</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>2 C.B.R. (4th) 70</CITE><COURTJUR>Man. Q.B.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Sobieski</EM>&rdquo;) had already been decided but before the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision in <EM>Wallace</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>I note that the Registrar's decision in <EM>Sobieski</EM> was rendered on January 15, 1997 and the Justice's decision on appeal was rendered October 10, 1997. Interestingly, <EM>Wallace</EM>, also arising from Manitoba, was decided October 30, 1997 by the Supreme Court of Canada. I suspect that because it was dealing with a pre-bankruptcy wrongful dismissal claim, and not a disability tax credit income tax refund, the Manitoba courts hearing <EM>Sobieski</EM> did not consider that <EM>Wallace</EM> may have had an impact on their decisions.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. My concern regarding the &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; approach cases is that these cases either focus on whether the DTCs were the property of the bankrupt or the disabled person<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ford</EM> at para. 30. <EM>Bolz, Sobieski, Nixon, Neufeld</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> or they do not appear to consider the wording of section 68 and <EM>Marzetti, Wallace</EM> and <EM>Landry</EM> (where applicable)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Nixon, Henderson, Bolz, Phillips and Gabrielle</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. Interestingly, the Courts in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Potter</SOC><CITE>2010 MBQB 36</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2010 MBQB 77</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Potter</EM>&rdquo;) did consider s. 68 but then made their decision using the &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; approach.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>I note that <EM>Potter</EM> is another decision on disability tax credit refunds arising out of Manitoba leaving one to wonder if the Courts deferred to the <EM>Sobieski</EM> decision because it came from their own Court.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. In <CASEREF><SOC>Re Byrne</SOC></CASEREF>, Registrar Funduk describes the bankruptcy court's move away from the &ldquo;vesting approach&rdquo;,
<QUOTE><P>Prior to 1997 bankruptcy courts used provincial exemptions law for exemptions for income. The 1997 change eliminates that and creates a uniform standard <UNDER>which applies regardless of the sources of income</UNDER>. <EM>Houlden &amp; Morawetz, Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency Act</EM> (The 2003 Annotated) correctly point out that s. 68 now avoids trying to classify income, p. 355. Section 68(1) says &ldquo;total income&rdquo; and s.-s.(2) says &ldquo;total income&rdquo; includes &ldquo;all revenues of a bankrupt of whatever nature and source&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Re Byrne</SOC><CITE>2003 ABQB 216 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF> at <BOLD>TAB 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>28. Mr. Klotz's paper also concludes that the &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; approach is &ldquo;no longer defensible, despite its lengthy pedigree&rdquo;.</P>
<P>29. For the reasons above and those that follow, we do not prescribe to using the &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; approach in dealing with Ms. Chomistek's pre-bankruptcy income tax refunds.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Section 68&rdquo; Approach</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. The third and final approach identified by Mr. Klotz is the &ldquo;Section 68&rdquo; approach which is characterized by a &ldquo;liberal and purposive interpretation&rdquo; of s. 68 of the BIA, extending its application to the pre-bankruptcy period. Mr. Klotz states that this line of authority arises from a trilogy of Supreme Court of Canada cases: <EM>Marzetti, Ramgotra</EM> and <EM>Wallace</EM>. While I agree that this approach does arise from a trilogy of cases, I believe the appropriate trilogy is <EM>Marzetti, Wallace</EM> and <EM>Landry</EM>, not <EM>Ramgotra</EM>. <EM>Ramgotra</EM> was a case about whether a transfer of funds in a non-exempt asset to an exempt asset could be void against the Trustee as a settlement. It was not about pre-bankruptcy earnings as Mr. Klotz's paper or the Amicus' brief suggests.</P>
<P>31. Both <EM>Marzetti</EM> and <EM>Wallace</EM> involve post-bankruptcy, not pre-bankruptcy, income. But, the Supreme Court's reasoning in <EM>Wallace</EM> suggests that the distinction is irrelevant. <EM>Wallace</EM> retained his right to sue for severance &ldquo;not because of the tinning of the acquisition of such property, but rather, because of the nature of the property in question.&rdquo; If property has the character of wages, its status in bankruptcy is not dependent upon when the claim arose. <EM>Wallace's</EM> claim was after-acquired property but it derived from wages and thus fell within s. 68.
<QUOTE><P>It is the character of the asset, not the accident of timing, that determines whether or not it falls into the bankrupt estate.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Wallace</EM>, at para. 69, at Part 2, Tab 3 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>32. It is from these cases that the principle that s. 68 of the BIA is a complete code with respect to wages arises,
<QUOTE><P>In my view, the reasoning in <EM>Marzetti</EM> and <EM>Wallace</EM> that led to the conclusion that s. 68 was a complete code with respect to wages applies equally to this new section. The current provision applies to the &ldquo;total income&rdquo; of the bankrupt and, as such, is even wider than the earlier reference to &ldquo;salary, wages and other remuneration&rdquo;; the provision expressly excludes the application of s. 67(1)(b); its purpose is no different than that described in <EM>Marzetti</EM> (except that applications to the court now appear to be limited to those cases where the issue cannot be otherwise resolved); and the jurisprudential principles reviewed by the Supreme Court in <EM>Marzetti</EM> are equally relevant.</P>
<P>I therefore conclude that s. 67 is superseded by the provisions of the current s. 68 in so far as the &ldquo;total income&rdquo; of the bankrupt is concerned. It follows that, as in <EM>Wallace</EM>, Landry's claim against her former employer and any consequent award relating to lost wages do not automatically vest in the trustee under ss. 67 and 71. Resort can only be had to s. 68 for payment of any portion thereof to the estate of the bankrupt.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Re Landry</SOC></CASEREF>, para. 30 to 31 at Part 2, Tab 2 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>33. Registrar Creegan in <EM>Ford</EM> summarizes the &ldquo;s. 68&rdquo; approach as follows,
<QUOTE><P>... if the funds in question are &ldquo;salary, wages or other remuneration&rdquo; under the old wording of s. 68 or are part of &ldquo;total income&rdquo; including &ldquo;all revenue of a bankrupt of whatever nature or source&rdquo; under the present wording of s. 68 earned or in some other way crystalized during the bankruptcy period and received during the bankruptcy or after discharge, they are to be distributed under s. 68. This follows clearly from <EM>Marzetti</EM>. It further follows from <EM>Landry</EM> that this applies also to such funds earned or crystalized before assignment, but not received until after assignment into bankruptcy.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Re Ford</SOC></CASEREF> at para. 37, at Part 2, Tab 20 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>34. The Amicus found nothing wrong in the analysis or the courts in <EM>Hynes</EM> (&ldquo;we think he was entirely correct&rdquo;), <EM>Cole</EM> and <EM>Ford</EM> (&ldquo;we think this decision was very well reasoned&rdquo;) and how they applied the s. 68 approach, yet the Amicus did not utilize the s. 68 approach or those Courts' analysis in coming to its conclusions.</P>
<P>35. Further, the Amicus agreed with the majority of Registrar Diamond's analysis in <EM>Bowerbank-Buckley</EM>, but disagreed with his misinterpretation of <EM>Landry</EM> and his decision not to apply s.68 (&ldquo;Registrar Diamond then, in our respectful view, made something of a hard left turn and, in doing so, misapplied the principles in <EM>Landry</EM>&rdquo;). The Amicus made the same &ldquo;hard left turn&rdquo; away from the s. 68 approach that it was otherwise in agreement with, in its own conclusions.</P>
<P>36. AAIRP submits that the s. 68 approach is the current state of the law and should be applied to Ms. Chomistek's pre-bankruptcy DTC income tax returns. It is submitted that the Amicus' brief was lending to his same conclusion until it began to refer to &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases, provincial wage exemptions and <EM>Ramgotra</EM>.</P>
<BLOCK4><TI>Why Ramgotra is not a Section 68 Case (and not a Wages/Earnings Case)</TI>
<P>37. Mr. Klotz's paper makes it sound like the SCC in Ramgotra gave great consideration to s. 68 in <EM>Ramgotra</EM>, which is just not true. <EM>Ramgotra</EM> was a case about a doctor in Saskatchewan who transferred money in a non-exempt asset, (his RRSPs were not exempt at the time) to an exempt asset, (RRIFs naming his wife as the beneficiary) 2 years before his made his assignment into bankruptcy and whether this was a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; and void against the Trustee. RRSPs were an asset that fell within s. 67&mdash;they were not earnings or wages. And, they certainly were not pre-bankruptcy wages as we are dealing with in this matter.</P>
<P>38. I believe that Mr. Klotz and the Amicus are both relying on para. 60 of <EM>Ramgotra</EM>, the only paragraph of the 43 pages of <EM>Ramgotra</EM> that referenced s. 68 of the BIA, and it states,
<QUOTE><P>After-acquired property is also dealt with in s. 68, which constitutes a complete code in respect of a bankrupt's salary, wages or other remuneration. The provision stipulates that after-acquired remuneration will not pass to and vest in the trustee unless the trustee intervenes by applying for a court order directing the payment of the remuneration (or a portion of it) to the trustee.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>39. In my opinion, para. 60 of <EM>Ramgotra</EM> falls far below a clear statement that s. 68 was limited to or <UNDER>only</UNDER> applied to post-bankruptcy salary, wages and other remuneration <UNDER>and not</UNDER> pre-bankruptcy wages. Instead, I read para. 60 as the Court explaining how provincial exemptions in property apply to an asset that otherwise vests in the Trustee under s. 67 but provincial exemptions do not apply if salary, wages and other remuneration which fall under s. 68 because s. 68 is a complete code.</P>
<P>40. In any event, as <EM>Ramgotra</EM> was not dealing with s. 68 of the BIA, para. 47 can also be taken as <EM>obiter dicta</EM>. Courts generally exclude <EM>Ramgotra</EM> from analysis of pre-bankruptcy wages as can be seen by the <EM>Wallace</EM> decision, one year after <EM>Ramgotra</EM>, and the <EM>Landry</EM> decision which both supported the SCC's reasoning in <EM>Marzetti</EM>.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Pre-67/Post-68&rdquo; Approach</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. The next two approaches, the &ldquo;Pre-67/Post-68&rdquo; Approach and the &ldquo;Equitable&rdquo; Approach are categories not identified by Mr. Klotz, not used by Courts very often and often distinguished by other courts. However, they are both approaches that the Amicus gives weight to in reaching its conclusions.</P>
<P>42. If one were to take the position that <EM>Ramgotra</EM> was a relevant case notwithstanding that it deals with a settlement issue over an otherwise non-exempt asset and not earnings or wages, pre-bankruptcy or otherwise, then <EM>Ramgotra</EM> would fall within the &ldquo;pre-67/post-68&rdquo; approach.</P>
<P>43. According to Mr. Klotz and the Amicus, s. 68 does not apply to pre-bankruptcy wages so all pre-bankruptcy wages vest in the Trustee under s. 67. If s. 67 applies, then so too do provincial wage exemptions. Thus, the Trustee is unable to retain more than the non-exempt portion&mdash;the exempt portion is returned to the bankrupt. This is really nothing more than the application of the vesting approach to pre-bankruptcy wages&mdash;something that both Registrar Funduk and Mr. Klotz say no longer applies.</P>
<P>44. Based on my review, this &ldquo;pre-67/post-68&rdquo; approach taken by the SCC in <EM>Ramgotra</EM> in 1996 was short-lived as in 1997, the SCC rendered its decision in <EM>Wallace</EM> which again reiterated the application of s. 68 to both pre- and post-bankruptcy income.</P>
<P>45. I am only aware of one DTC income tax refund decision that follows the &ldquo;pre-67/post-68&rdquo; approach, <EM>Bolz</EM>, which the Amicus points out is flawed by how it failed to characterize the DTC income tax refund as earnings or wages, in accordance with <EM>Marzetti</EM>.</P>
<P>46. While the Amicus relies on <EM>Ramgotra</EM> in reaching its conclusion, I note a conflict between conclusions 4 and 6 on page 38 of the Amicus' brief. On one hand (conclusion 4), the Amicus states, and I agree, that section 68 of the BIA applies to &ldquo;total income&rdquo; which is &ldquo;earned OR received&rdquo; by the bankrupt between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge. Then, on the other hand (conclusion 6), the Amicus states that the law as far as pre-bankruptcy earnings &ldquo;not received&rdquo; during bankruptcy is that <EM>Ramgotra</EM> applies. This fails to take into account the &ldquo;earned&rdquo; aspect of s. 68 that the Amicus reached at conclusion 4.</P>
<P>47. Section 68 is a complete code and does not utilize provincial wage exemptions, but as you will see below, built into it is the ability of a Trustee or the Court to give consideration to a bankrupt's personal and family situation.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>The &ldquo;Equitable&rdquo; Approach</UNDER></TI>
<P>48. Finally, we have the &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; approach that was used in <EM>Neufeld</EM>. In my opinion, this was a result-driven decision. The Court found a trust so that the bankrupt, the recipient of the refunds, was not the owner of the refunds but instead only holding the refunds for the benefit of the disabled dependant.</P>
<P>49. As stated by Registrar Creegan in <EM>Ford</EM>, &ldquo;[t]he decision has been criticized and the trust analysis is generally not accepted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ford</EM> at para. 29 at Part 2, TAB 20 of the Amicus' Brief.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. I did not see similar reasoning used with respect to any other DTC income tax refund cases and submit that the &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; approach is not applicable today. Furthermore, such reasoning is unnecessary given the fact that s. 68 is a complete code and provides consideration of a bankrupt's personal and family situation.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. Procedure to be Applied</TI>
<P>51. Using the s. 68 approach to analyze Ms. Chomistek's pre-bankruptcy DTC income tax refunds, we take the following steps (remembering that the tax refunds of $2,879.36 for the year of bankruptcy vest in the Trustee per s.67(1)(c)):
<P1>a. First, we characterize the asset. In this specific case, the pre-bankruptcy income tax refunds arising from the DTC are &ldquo;income&rdquo; as they are derived from the bankrupt's employment&mdash;wages. And, in this case, the amount at issue totals $17,460.46.</P1>
<P1>b. Then, s. 68 dictates that:
<P2>i. the Trustee &ldquo;having regard to [the Superintendent Guidelines] and to the personal and family situation of the bankrupt, determines whether the bankrupt has surplus income.&rdquo; In this case, Ms. Chomistek received an increase in income (lump sum payment of pre-bankruptcy income) as provided at Example 5 of Directive No. 11R2-2017, Surplus Income.
<P3>Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada&mdash;Directive No. 11R2-2017, Surplus Income at <BOLD>TAB 3.</BOLD></P3></P2>
I see little difference between a bankrupt receiving a lump sum payment for lost wages (like in <EM>Landry</EM>) and a bankrupt receiving income tax refunds for pre-bankruptcy tax returns where the income being refunded was derived from the bankrupt's wages.
<P2>ii. In 2017, the Superintendent's Standard for a family of 3 was $3,246.00, so a calculation based on the bankrupt's monthly income of $3,156.28 would ordinarily result in $16,652.98 of the pre-bankruptcy income tax refunds to accrue to the estate, as follows:

<P2>iii. The Trustee's determination would be subject to the Official Receiver's recommendation;</P2>
<P2>iv. If the Trustee and the bankrupt do not agree with the amount that the bankrupt would be required to pay, the Trustee can request mediation (similarly a Creditor can as well); and</P2>
<P2>v. The Trustee can make an application to the Court to have the Court fix the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay to the Estate for surplus income. In determining whether the bankrupt has surplus income and how much they shall pay to their estate, the Court will also have regard to the Superintendent Guidelines and to the personal and family situation of the bankrupt.</P2></P1></P>
<P>52. Based on the Superintendent Guideline surplus income calculation above, Ms. Chomistek would be entitled to receive $807.48, and the remaining $16,652.98 of pre-bankruptcy earnings Would be payable to the Estate.</P>
<P>53. Of course, the above calculation does not take into account the personal and family situation of the bankrupt, which the Trustee or the Court can use their discretion to determine the ultimate payment to accrue to the estate. Section 68, as a complete code, allows for these issues to be taken into account.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. Remaining Areas of Disagreement</TI>
<P>54. The two remaining areas of disagreement between AAIRP and the Amicus are (a) the relevance of the &ldquo;pain and suffering cases&rdquo; and (b) the application of provincial wage exemptions.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Relevance of &ldquo;Pain and Suffering&rdquo; Cases</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases put forward by the Amicus closely align with the &ldquo;equitable approach&rdquo; used in the <EM>Neufeld</EM> decision and it was in <EM>Neufeld</EM> where an analogy was drawn to damages for pain and suffering. Other than in <EM>Neufeld</EM>, which has been criticized by other DTC income tax refund cases, &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases have not factored into decisions regarding DTC income tax refunds.</P>
<P>56. As such, I submit that the &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo; cases are not applicable to the determination of this matter.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>V.</N><TI><UNDER>Why Provincial Wage Exemptions Do Not Apply</UNDER></TI>
<P>57. Provincial wage exemptions do not apply for two reasons: (a) section 68 is a complete code in respect of a bankrupt's wages; and (b) income tax refunds, generally, are immune from provincial garnishee summons.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Section 68 is a Complete Code for a Bankrupt's Wages</TI>
<P>58. In rendering its decision in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, Justice lacobucci for the SCC held that,
<QUOTE><P>...the language of s. 68, the inferred purpose of that provision, and the decision of this Court in <EM>Vachon</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, all support the conclusion that s. 68 is a substantive provision, one which is intended to operate as a complete code in respect of a bankrupt's salary, wages, or other remuneration.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Marzetti</EM>, at para. 67 at Part 2, Tab 1 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>59. One of the reasons why the SCC reached this conclusion was because otherwise, the treatment of the bankrupt's wages would depend on their province of residence.
<QUOTE><P>Parliament no doubt considered it unreasonable for the treatment of bankrupt persons to depend upon the happenstance of provincial residence. Of course, even if one accepts that s. 68 is a complete code in respect of salary, wages, and other remuneration, the potential for uneven treatment across Canada remains in respect of other provincially exempted property. But it is hardly surprising that Parliament selected an important form of property&mdash;salary, wages and other remuneration&mdash;and gave that property special treatment.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Marzetti</EM>, at para. 63 at Part 2, Tab 1 of the Amicus' Brief.</P1></P>
<P>60. In support of the Court's reasoning in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, section 68 has been amended to even greater strengthen the argument that it is a complete code and align with the SCC's interpretation in <EM>Marzetti</EM>.
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(2)</N><TI>Definitions</TI><SSECP><DEF><DEFP><TERM>&ldquo;total income&rdquo;</TERM>
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>Includes,..., a bankrupt's <EM>revenues of whatever nature or from whatever source</EM> that are <UNDER>earned or received</UNDER> by the bankrupt between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of the bankrupt's discharge,...</PARAP></PARA></DEFP></DEF></SSECP></SSEC>
<P>(my emphasis)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>61. Under section 68, Trustees are required to collect a prescribed portion of the bankrupt's surplus income for the benefit of the debtor's estate and the benefit of creditors. Trustees calculate the amount of surplus income that a debtor may have with reference to the Superintendent of Bankrupt's standards, <EM>taking into account the personal and family situation of the bankrupt</EM>.</P>
<P>62. For our purposes, s. 68 being a complete code makes provincial wage exemptions inapplicable on one hand and gives discretion to the Trustee (or Court via application) on the other hand to take into account the bankrupt's personal and family situation. What is left is the bankrupt's personal and family situation still being addressed but instead of by provincial wage exemptions, it is by a discretionary application of the surplus income calculations.</P>
<P>63. Courts have used their discretion provided by s. 68(10) to declare that retroactive child support payments<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Dumont</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 692</CITE></CASEREF>;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, lump sum payments for past loss of income<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Anderson</SOC><CITE>2004 ABQB 349</CITE></CASEREF>;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and employment benefits<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Ferrara</SOC><CITE>2005 ABQB 61</CITE></CASEREF>;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> among others, not be included in the calculations of surplus income.
<P1><EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>, s. 68(10); <BOLD>TAB 4</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Re Dumont</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 692 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>29</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <BOLD>TAB 5</BOLD>;</P1>

<P>64. It is similarly open to this Court to declare that any DTC income tax refunds that would otherwise be payable to the Trustee as surplus income be excluded in the calculations of Ms. Chomistek's surplus income.</P>
<P>65. This discretion is important because it provides consistency across the country and eliminates the application of a provincial wage exemption from applying that could lead to a unwanted result, like income tax refunds arising from a debtor's &ldquo;RRSP stuffing&rdquo; prior to bankruptcy (but otherwise not voidable).</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Federal Crown's Immunity</TI>
<P>66. At common law, the Federal Crown is immune from garnishment. This principle is based on the Crown prerogative, which among other things, stands for the proposition that in the absence of a Federal statute enabling it, no order or injunction may be made against the Federal Crown.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>A. N.R. v. Croteau</SOC><CITE>1925 CanLII 46</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <BOLD>TAB 8</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Royal Bank of Canada v. Scott</SOC><CITE>1971 CanLII 1129</CITE><COURTJUR>NWTTC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <BOLD>TAB 9</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>67. This common law principle was codified by s.67 of the <EM>Financial Administration Act</EM> and s. 22 of the <EM>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</EM>.
<P1><EM>Financial Administration Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c F-11, s. 67, <BOLD>TAB 10</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1><EM>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c C-50, s. 22, <BOLD>TAB 10</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>68. Parliament is the only body who can legislate the Federal Crown out of the common law immunity, and it has done so in two respects: salaries of its employees and garnishment for family support orders&mdash;neither one is applicable in this case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act</EM>, R.S. 1985, c. G-2 and <EM>Family Orders and Enforcement Assistance Act</EM>, R.S. 1985, c.4 (2<SUP>nd</SUP> Supp.) and the <EM>Family Support Orders and Agreements G Regulations</EM>, SOR 88-181 and SOR 2006-296.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>69. The <EM>Civil Enforcement Act</EM> defines garnishees as &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and defines &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to include the &ldquo;Crown <UNDER>except where the context otherwise requires</UNDER>&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Civil Enforcement Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c.C-15, s.77(3) and s.1(ii), <BOLD>TAB 11</BOLD>.</P1></P>
<P>70. It is a long-standing constitutional principle that provincial legislatures cannot bind the Federal Crown. Given the crown prerogative and constitutional limitations of the Provincial legislature, I submit that the &ldquo;except where the context otherwise requires&rdquo; found in the definition of persons applies such that reference to the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; only applies to the Province of Alberta, not the Federal Crown.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. Conclusion</TI>
<P>71. The BIA is clear that income tax refunds for the year of the bankruptcy vest in the Trustee. We are then left with determining the treatment of the bankrupt's DTC income tax refunds that relate to the pre-bankruptcy tax years.</P>
<P>72. As identified by lacobucci J. and Major J.A. in their respective courts in <EM>Marzetti</EM>, the starting point is the character of the income tax refund itself. In this case, Ms. Chomistek's income tax refunds arose from wages.</P>
<P>73. Section 68 of the BIA provides a complete code with respect to a bankrupt's wages. Other than the refund amount attributable to the tax year of the bankruptcy, a lump sum pre-bankruptcy tax refund is really no different than a lump sum payment for pre-bankruptcy lost wages.</P>
<P>74. Section 68 requires a Trustee or Court to give regards to the <EM>personal and family situation</EM> of the bankrupt. Provincial wage exemptions do not apply and cases pertaining to pain and suffering are not relevant. The Trustee and the Court have discretion to determine the ultimate payment to accrue to the estate.</P>
<P>75. Applying s. 67(l)(c) to the income tax refund for the tax year of the bankruptcy and a strict calculation of surplus income would allocate the $20,339.82 Fund as follows:

<P>76. AAIRP does not make any submissions with respect to how the Court should use its discretion under s. 68(10) in this case. AAlRP's role in this matter has been to ensure that the proper analysis is used so that Trustees can discharge their duties under the BIA, namely s. 68, and not have to consider issues beyond the complete code that is s. 68.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF MARIE KOZLOWSKI SWORN ON DECEMBER 7, 2017</TI>
<P>Marie Kozlowski, of the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a Chartered Insolvency and Restructuring Professional, a senior Vice President at Hardie &amp; Kelly Inc., Licensed Insolvency Trustee, and Treasurer of the Alberta Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals (&ldquo;AAIRP&rdquo;). As such, I have persona] knowledge of the matters and facts hereinafter deposed to except where stated to be based upon information and belief, in which case I do verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. AAIRP represents Chartered Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals (CIRPs) and Licensed Insolvency Trustees (LITs) in bankruptcy in Alberta.</P>
<P>3. I am advised by Donna Carson, a member of AAIRP, and the Licensed Insolvency Trustee administering the bankruptcy of Cindy Hannele Chomistek, and do verily believe that:
<P1>(a) a Special Chambers Application has been scheduled on Friday, December 8, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. to deal with the treatment of disability tax credits, related to the Bankrupt's disabled child, claimed by the Bankrupt for pre-bankruptcy and bankruptcy tax years, but filed after the date of her discharge from bankruptcy;</P1>
<P1>(b) tax refunds arising from the Bankrupt's claims for disability tax returns were paid by Canada Revenue Agency to the Trustee in Bankruptcy, MNP Ltd., and are held in trust pending court order; and</P1>
<P1>(c) an <EM>amicus curiae</EM> was appointed by the Court in the within matter and has submitted a lengthy brief with respect to this issue.</P1></P>
<P>4. AAIRP would like to appear as intervenor in this matter, filing its own brief and making its own submissions because:
<P1>(a) its members will be affected by the decision facing the Court;</P1>
<P1>(b) it has special expertise and insight to bring to the issues facing the Court; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the Licensed Insolvency Trustee has no resources in the Estate to funds representation, so the interests of Licensed Insolvency Trustees, generally, would not be fully protected without the involvement of AAIRP as intervenor.</P1></P>
<P>5. I make this application in support of an adjournment of the Special Chambers Application and an order granting AAIRP intervenor status in the matter for the purposes of filing its own brief and making its own submissions on behalf of Chartered Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals and Licensed Insolvency Trustees in bankruptcy in Alberta and for no improper purpose.</P>
