<P><BOLD>THE PLAINTIFF</BOLD> appeals to the Divisional Court from the verdict of the jury as accepted by the presiding trial judge, The Honourable Mr. Justice Myers, dated September 28, 2016, at the City of Toronto.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE APPELLANT ASKS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1) That the jury verdict be set aside and that a new trial be ordered.</P>
<P>2) In the alternative, that this Court issue judgment substituting its assessment of the plaintiff's damages.</P>
<P>3) That the respondents pay the appellant his costs of the trial and this appeal.</P>
<P>4) Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The learned Trial Judge erred at law in failing to properly instruct the jury regarding the law of causation.</P>
<P>2. The learned Trial Judge erred at law by giving a charge to the jury that deprived the plaintiff of a fair trial.</P>
<P>3. The learned Trial Judge unfairly and unevenly commented upon the evidence and the credibility of the plaintiff when the credibility of the plaintiff was in dispute and thereby tainted the jury's impression of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>5. The errors of the learned Trial Judge, collectively or individually, resulted in a substantial wrong or a miscarriage of justice that can only be remedied though setting aside the jury's verdict and ordering a new trial.</P>
<P>6. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD></P>
<P>1. The judgment is a final order of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice;</P>
<P>2. Section 6(1)(b) and 19(1.2)(a) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990 c C. 43, as amended;</P>
<P>3. Rule 61 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg 194, as amended; and</P>
<P>4. Leave to appeal is not required.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">Part I&mdash;Nature of Appeal</TI>
<P>1. The charge to the jury is a central feature in any jury trial. In the context of our adversarial process, its strength lies in its objectivity. In an otherwise partisan atmosphere, the jury is entitled to look to the charge to guide it safely through its deliberations and assist it in arriving at a true verdict according to law.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Baltovich</SOC><CITE>2004 CarswellOnt 5013</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paragraph 115; Appellant's Brief of Authorities, Tab 1</P1></P>
<P>2. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice F. Myers, dated November 18, 2016, made at Toronto, and entered in accordance with a jury verdict. The jury had been tasked with determining Alan Mandel's entitlement to damages arising from a July 4, 2009 motor vehicle accident (&ldquo;Accident&rdquo;). Alan was a passenger in his wife's stopped vehicle when it was struck from behind by the respondents' vehicle.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alan Mandel, in-ch, page 222, lines 29&ndash;32 and page 223, lines 1&ndash;16, Appeal Book, Tab 7 B, pages 89 and 90</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Myers' charge was partisan and it misdirected the jury as to the test to be applied by it to determine temporal causation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">Part II&mdash;Overview</TI>
<P>3. Alan Mandel (&ldquo;Alan&rdquo;) had never experienced shoulder pain before the Accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Dr. P. Forman, Alan's family doctor testified that he had no notes or recollection of Alan complaining of shoulder pain, jaw or back pain, during the five years that he treated Alan prior to the Accident: page 46, lines 1&ndash;32, page 64, lines 8&ndash;32 and page 65, lines 1&ndash;20, Appeal Book, Tab 7 A, pages 41, 43 and 44</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> From the date of the Accident onwards, Alan experienced significant bilateral shoulder pain, which necessitated painful and time-consuming treatments, and ultimately bilateral shoulder surgery. Although a former supervisor described him as a reliable, productive, enthusiastic person who &ldquo;<EM>loved his job, loved what he was doing</EM>,&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>John Kelly, in-ch, page 349, lines 21&ndash;30, Appeal Book, Tab 7 C, page 114</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> he never regained his ability to work. A devoted father and husband, he remained unable to resume his usual social activities or coach baseball. One of the respondents' medical experts described Alan as &ldquo;straightforward.&rdquo; Another acknowledged that he had no reason to doubt Alan's assertion that he suffered from &ldquo;debilitating&rdquo; pain. Despite an admission of liability and compelling evidence that Alan suffered very serious and permanent physical and psychological impairments, including documented evidence of shoulder complaints within ten days of the Accident, which lead to shoulder surgery, following a thirteen day trial, the jury awarded Alan only $3,000.00 for pain and suffering, and nothing for past or future lost income, future care expenses or housekeeping services.</P>
<P>4. The overriding consideration of the Court is the appearance and preservation of the integrity and fairness of the judicial process. Towards that end, jurors must receive a balanced, impartial charge and proper instructions as to the application of the relevant law in order to reach a fair and proper verdict. Alan asserts that the jury verdict was the result of an inadequate, confusing, and biased jury charge, and respectfully requests that this Court set it aside and substitute its assessment of his damages or, in the alternative, order a new trial.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">Part III&mdash;Facts</TI>
<P>5. The trial of this action was heard by a jury in the City of Toronto in September of 2016, before the Honourable Mr. Justice F. Myers. The action arose from a motor vehicle accident on July 4, 2009. Liability for the Accident was admitted prior to trial: The jury was asked to determine the extent of Alan's damages.</P>

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Car Accident</TI>
<P>8. At the time of the Accident, Alan was a front seat-belted passenger in an Uplander minivan being driven by his wife when their vehicle was rear-ended by the respondents' Dodge Nitro.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alan Mandel, in-ch, page 224, lines 1&ndash;11, Appeal Book, Tab 7 B, page 91</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The damage to the Mandel vehicle cost $1,401.42 to repair.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Alan Mandel, in-ch, page 228, lines 5&ndash;13, Appeal Book, Tab 7 B, page 92</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The respondents never disclosed the extent of the damage to their Nitro.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Alan Mandel's Pre-accident Health</TI>
<P>9. Alan's extensive pre and post-Accident health records were admitted into evidence at trial, and his family doctor, Dr. P. Forman testified. As noted above, although Alan had had some pre- Accident anxiety and depression in around 2003 to 2004 and serious sinus infections which eventually required surgery in July of 2007, there was no evidence that he had ever reported neck, back or shoulder pain or impairments in the five years prior to the 2009 Accident.</P>

<QUOTE><P>In assessing causation, it's important to avoid the logical fallacy of automatically assuming a causal connection between two events just because one closely follows the other in time. We have all heard about cases where children have become very ill shortly after receiving vaccinations, yet the science is clear that the vaccines often do not cause illness. People naturally want to ascribe cause and the most recent event is the most natural conclusion. However, the simple fact that something came first and something else came after does not automatically or necessarily prove causation.</P>
<P>In a vaccine case, a former judge of this court wrote that, &ldquo;Statistically within any large group of population, the chances of a number of illnesses developing within three days of virtually any observable event are great.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Mr. Mandel put his shoes on in the morning before his motor vehicle accident.

<P>34.

<QUOTE><P>Many issues in this case come down to credibility i.e. whose testimony do you accept? In assessing the credibility and reliability of testimony, you might want to consider the following questions:</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>5. Was the witness honest and forthright? You heard one example of a witness's testimony being impeached with evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. You may recall that Mr. Mandel testified that he saw the car coming at them in the passenger's side mirror. On his out of court examination for discovery, in which he was under oath, he swore that he &lsquo;looked up&rsquo; at the driver's rear view mirror when he saw Ms. Fakhim's vehicle coming. He is recorded as having told several doctors this too. He agreed in court that sitting in the passenger's seat, he would not likely have been able to see Ms. Fakhim's car coming in the driver's rearmview mirror. If he did not see the car coming, how could he have braced? His testimony changed at trial from looking up at the rear view mirror to looking at the side mirror. When confronted with the inconsistency in a sworn testimony, he said that this was an example of the problem he was having fumbling for words due to his injury. Does that strike you as a reasonable, credible explanation exercising your common sense? Does fumbling between the words rear view and side view explain why he said that he was looking up at the mirror? Does it explain why he wrote &lsquo;I was looking in the rear view mirror&rsquo; in the OCF 3 benefits claim form as early as July 24, 2009 that's Exhibit 3? You should assess the difference between Mr. Mandel's testimony on examination for discovery, and at trial, and come to your own conclusion as to whether if affects your view of the credibility of his testimony. It is open to you to find that he was correct at trial, that he made a simple mistake, he lied, or anything in between.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Charge to the jury, pages 1247, lines 25&ndash;30 and Page 1248, lines 1&ndash;25 Appeal Book, Tab 7 P, pages 203 and 204</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>7. Does a witness show any tendency to exaggerate? ...You might also consider whether Mr. Mandel was exaggerating his pain? Dr. Young says that his test results showed that Mr. Mandel exaggerates the physical pains he suffers. Dr. Ford said that he reported back pain using the Waddell test, model test, that are designed to determine if there's a non-organic component to a person's pain.</P>
<P>You saw Mr. Mandel for more than two weeks. He stood up once every so often and walked around at the back of the courtroom. You saw him under pressure in the witness stand several times as his testimony was interrupted by others. He says that in a week he has one or two good days, one or two bad days where he must stay in bed and can only sit up to watch TV, and the rest are really bad days when he can only get out of bed to go to the washroom with help. He has had no nerve blocks since the week before the trial started. Did you see someone suffering 9 out of 10 pain, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable? Did you see corroboration of his description of his good, bad, and really bad days? He said he goes right to bed at night and that he had to take hydromorphone on the first weekend during the trial. You saw the surveillance video, all but one of which was taken at least a week after Mr. Mandel had his most recent nerve block. Was it consistent with how Mr. Mandel described his pain and his functional limitations?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Charge to the jury, page 1250, lines 15&ndash;25; Appeal Book, Tab 7 P, page 205</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>Here you know that there was a minor collision. You know the damage to the vehicles. You will have the repair details with you in the jury room. You have Mr. Mandel's work history and his health history. You know the details of his extensive treatments he has endured over the past seven years. Did he suffer physical disabilities before the MVA? Are his reports of depression, disc pain, arthritis in his neck, heartburn, and sinus pain, all of which kept him from work for varying periods of time before the MVA relevant to the disabilities from which he now suffers? Did he have psychological issues with his father's death, overreaction to pain, or problems with working before the MVA? Is the fact that Dr. Forman counselled Mr. Mandel for 22 minutes about his mother's cancer diagnosis on the same day that Mr. Mandel first reported his problems relevant to a psychological disability if you accept that he has one? Was he looking at the side view mirror before the accident? Did he know that a car was coming? If so, did he brace with his arms in front of him as he testified? Did he stiffen up while sitting erect as he told doctors?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Charge to the Jury, page 1279, lines 11&ndash;32 and page 1280, lines 1&ndash;3; Appeal Book, Tab 7 P, paged 207 and 208</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>

<P>37. The jury ultimately awarded Alan $3,000.00 for non-pecuniary general damages and nothing else.</P>
<P>38. Contrary to section 267.5(15) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> R.S.O. 1990 c.I8, as amended, Justice Myers declined to determine whether Alan sustained the required &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; impairments to claim entitlement to non-pecuniary damages as per section 267.5(5) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, stating:
<QUOTE><P>10 If a judge can find facts that are inconsistent with the jury's findings and that have legal effect, what justification is there to summon people away from their lives to compel them to attend court? I am already being paid to do the same job anyway.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>18 In my view, this is precisely the case where the doctrine of mootness requires full application. If the decision that I am called upon to make risks undermining the jury's clear findings and my decision has no effect in any event because plaintiff will receive no damages as a result of the jury's verdict and the statutory deductible, then not only is there no purpose in making the threshold decision, but making the decision risks undermining the important and singular function of the jury.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>43. An injured plaintiff must show on a balance of probabilities that he was injured by the defendant and that his injury would not have occurred but for a defendant's negligence. The &ldquo;but for&rdquo; test must be applied in a robust common sense fashion. There is no need for scientific evidence of the precise contribution the defendant's negligence made to the injury.

<P>44. There is no legal principle that holds that if a collision is not severe or violent, or if there is no significant damage to a motor vehicle, the individual seated within that vehicle at the time of the impact cannot have sustained injuries. The authorities clearly establish that, while the lack of vehicle damage may be a relevant consideration, the extent of the injuries suffered by a plaintiff is not to be measured by the severity of the force in a collision or the degree of the vehicle's damage. Rather, the existence and extent of a plaintiff's injuries is to be determined on the basis of the evidentiary record at trial.

<P>45. <CASEREF><SOC>White v. Stonestreet</SOC></CASEREF> dealt with the reliability of inferences drawn from temporal connections when determining causation. Justice Ehrcke explained it this way:
<QUOTE><P>[74] The inference from a temporal sequence to a causal connection, however, is not always reliable. In fact, this form of reasoning so often results in false conclusions that logicians have given it a Latin name. It is sometimes referred to as the fallacy of <EM>post hoc ergo propter hoc</EM>: &ldquo;after this therefore because of this.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[75] In searching for causes, a temporal connection is sometimes the only thing to go on. But if a mere temporal connection is going to form the basis for a conclusion about the cause of an event, then it is important to examine that temporal connection carefully. Just how close are the events in time? Were there other events happening around the same time, or even closer in time, that would provide an alternate, and more accurate, explanation of the true cause?</P></QUOTE>

<P>48. In <CASEREF><SOC>Midgley v. Nguyen</SOC></CASEREF>, which concerned claim for damages as a result of a motor vehicle accident, the British Columbia Supreme Court stated:
<QUOTE><P>[167] Whether a defendant is liable to a plaintiff for an injury is a matter of causation. It is crucial to keep in mind the analytical distinction between determining causation and assessing damages, since different principles govern the two questions.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>[168] The primary test to be applied in determining causation is commonly articulated as the &lsquo;but for&rsquo; test. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that &lsquo;but for&rsquo; the negligent act or omission of the defendant, the plaintiff's injury would not have occurred.</P>
<P>[169] The &lsquo;but for&rsquo; test need not be determined with scientific precision. Rather, causation is a practical question of fact which can be best answered by ordinary common sense.</P>
<P>[170] A plaintiff need not establish that a defendant's tortious conduct is the sole cause of the injury. A defendant will be fully liable for the hard suffered by a plaintiff, even if other casual factors for which he is not responsible were at play in producing the harm, as long as the plaintiff establishes a substantial connection between the injuries and the defendant's negligence beyond the &lsquo;<EM>de minimus</EM>&rsquo; range.</P>
<P>[171] The court must be cautious when inferring causation from a temporal sequence; that is, from a consideration of pre-accident versus post-accident condition. <BOLD>In cases where causation is asserted primarily on a temporal relationship between the negligent conduct and injury in question, the authorities mandate that a &lsquo;close scrutiny of the evidence is required because the inference from a temporal sequence to a causal connection is not always reliable.&rsquo; However, the authorities recognize that temporal reasoning is not an illegitimate analysis if invoked in the appropriate circumstances</BOLD>.

<P>49. While an appellate court reviewing a trial judge's charge will not hold the instructions to a jury to a standard of perfection, there should be a focus on whether the jury would have, considering the charge in its entirety, properly understood the law.

<P>50. The overarching issue in this trial was whether the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that his medical conditions (in particular his shoulder issues) were caused by the Accident. The trial judge's charge to the jury regarding temporal causation was, with respect, wrong at law and misleading, in that it involved non-material examples and undermined the appellant's valid assertion that the very close and well-documented temporal connection between the Accident and his shoulder injuries and the complete absence of any other explanation for those injuries, was the critical factor for the jury to consider when determining causation.</P></BLOCK3>

<P>53. The presumption of judicial impartiality may be rebutted by evidence of a reasonable apprehension of bias.

<P>54. The trial judge has no right to intervene in such a manner as to constitute possible injustice to either party. When a judge intervenes in the trial to such an extent that he or she projects himself into the arena, the judge, of necessity, adopts a position which is inimical to the interests of one or other of the litigants. Those actions, whether conscious or unconscious, no matter how well intentioned or motivated, creates an atmosphere which violates the principle that &ldquo;justice not only be done, but appear to be done&rdquo;. Intervention amounting to interference in the conduct of a tri al destroys the image of judicial impartiality and deprives the Court of jurisdiction. The right to intervene is one of degree and there cannot be a precise line of demarcation, but if it can be fairly said that it amounted to the usurpation of the function of counsel it is not permissible.

<P>56. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Baltovich</SOC></CASEREF> the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of an objective jury charge, albeit in the context of a criminal matter:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD>115 The charge to the jury is a central feature in any jury trial. In the context of our adversarial process, its strength lies in its objectivity. In an otherwise partisan atmosphere, the jury is entitled to look to the charge to guide it safely through its deliberations and assist it in arriving at a true verdict according to law.</BOLD></P>
<P>116 Much has been said in recent years about the complexity of jury charges and the need to simplify them. Trial judges face a difficult task in this regard, especially when it comes to explaining complicated issues of law. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Jacquard</SOC><YEAR>1997</YEAR><CITE>113 C.C.C. (3d) 1</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 2, Chief Justice Lamer observed that while &ldquo;accused individuals are entitled to properly instructed juries&rdquo;, there is &ldquo;no requirement for perfectly instructed juries&rdquo;. Those words are as true today as they were then. No one expects perfection in a jury charge. Mistakes are bound to occur.</P>
<P><BOLD>117 But not all mistakes are alike. Some can easily be avoided. Failing to provide the jury with a fair and balanced charge is one of them. There is no justification for jury charges that are not even-handed.</BOLD></P>
<P>118 We cannot stress enough the importance of a fair and balanced charge. A charge that meets those requirements is much more likely to withstand appellate review than one that does not: See <EM>Jacquard</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at para. 56. In practical terms, this may mean the difference between dismissing the appeal, and ordering a new trial with all of its attendant costs and hardships. Our system of justice is already overburdened. We do not need to add to this problem with new trials that could have been avoided. Further, s. 11(d) of the <EM>Charter</EM> provides that every person charged with an offence has the right to a fair trial. This is a fundamental right. Unfair and unbalanced charges undermine this right [<EM>emphasis added</EM>].</P></QUOTE>

<P>57. Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Duong v. R</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal stressed:

<P>58. There have been various formulations of guidelines to be used by appellate courts in deciding whether a trial judge has gone too far in expressing an opinion. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Garofoli</SOC></CASEREF>, the Court of Appeal stated that an appellate court may find that the trial judge has crossed the boundary, even though the jury was told that they were not bound by his views on the evidence, if:
<P1>1) the opinion expressed is far stronger than that facts warrant; or</P1>
<P1>2) the opinion is expressed so strongly that there is a likelihood that the jury would be overawed by it.</P1>

<P>59. In <CASEREF><SOC>McFarlane v. Safadi</SOC></CASEREF> the Court of Appeal considered, amongst other things, whether the trial judge's charge had been balanced and fair. The Court stated:
<QUOTE><P>31. The hallmark of a fair trial is that the judge preside with impartiality and neutrality between the parties. The judge must not cross the line and become a participant in the litigation. When he or she does so, his or her impartiality and neutrality are lost. It is at that moment that the trial ceases to be fair.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>39 The trial judge advised the jury in his charge that, &ldquo;If you come to a conclusion that some of my questions indicated that I had a particular opinion as to the facts of this case, then I ask you and I invite you just to ignore any views that you have as to what I might think.&rdquo; Whether such an instruction was sufficient is questionable. However, its effect was significantly reduced by his subsequent return to his strong criticism of the police officer's failure to conduct a thorough accident investigation.</P>
<P>40 In my view, based on the comments of the trial judge, the jury would have had a very difficult time coming to any conclusion other than that the police officer had failed to do his duty and, had he not done so, he would likely have come to a different conclusion concerning Mr. Hansen's liability.</P></QUOTE>

<P>60. The jury must remain the arbiter of the facts, such that any comments made by the trial judge cannot amount to a rebuttal of a party's address to the jury or unfairly denigrate or undermine the position of a party.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Lawes</SOC><CITE>2006 CarswellOnt 1072</CITE><COURTJUR>CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 23; Appellant's Brief of Authorities Tab 20</P1></P>
<P>61. Comments made by judges expressing disbelief or skepticism regarding a party's position or appearing to adopt an adversarial position towards a party can certainly raise a reasonable apprehension that the judge's mind was closed to an impartial view of a party's case. That kind of conduct destroys the image of impartiality that must exist in a courtroom.

<P>62. A judge's viewpoint has the potential to unduly influence a jury. Charge instructions that either directly or indirectly directed the jury to a conclusion inimical to the appellant are beyond what a judge should be permitted to do as a neutral arbitrator of the process. In concatenating distinct pieces of evidence as he did (such as juxtaposing the dates when Alan received nerve block injections with the dates when he was observed on surveillance), the trial judge, in effect, became a protagonist for the respondents.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The jury verdict was inordinately low.</TI>
<P>63. An appellate court will overturn a jury's verdict where the Court is satisfied that the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could not reasonably have rendered. If the re has been a miscarriage of justice or a substantial wrong, the jury's verdict cannot stand.

<P>64. This Court has stated that:
<QUOTE><P>Normally this Court, depending on the amount of damages, takes the view that if it is of the opinion that the award is too high or too low by 50 per cent, it concludes that the damages are inordinately high or low and varies it accordingly or directs a new trial if it is a jury verdict.</P></QUOTE>

<P>65. Having regard to the extent of Alan's injuries and, in particular his bilateral shoulder surgeries, the jury's award of $3,000.00 for pain and suffering is grossly inadequate, such as to constitute a miscarriage of justice such that appellate intervention is warranted. A chart setting out damages awarded to plaintiffs with complaints similar to those of Alan is attached as Schedule &ldquo;F.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>

<P>67. Where the fairness of the trial is not in issue, and the jury appears simply to have arrived at an inappropriate assessment on the evidence, the interest in avoiding the delay and expense of a new trial would seem to weigh in favour of the appellate court substituting its own assessment.

<P>68. In <CASEREF><SOC>Pilon v. Janveaux</SOC></CASEREF>, the jury was inadvertently not asked to apportion the degree of fault as between the various defendants. The Court of Appeal decided that it was appropriate that it apportion liability, concluding that:
<QUOTE><P>[T]he interests of justice require that a new trial be avoided if possible. Memories will be stale, and the cost is prohibitive. Instead, this court should perform the apportionment task that the jury ought to have been instructed to and did not perform. (para. 31)</P></QUOTE>

<P>70. Access to justice in a timely manner is a right at least as fundamental and important to a plaintiff as trial by jury is to a defendant.

<P>71. In <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Mauldin</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court Canada, in the context of summary judgment motions, endorsed the principle that that access to justice will sometimes require more expeditious manners of resolving disputes than a full trial procedure. Karakatsanis J., writing for the unanimous Court, directed:
<QUOTE><P>Ensuring access to justice is the greatest challenge to the rule of law in Canada today. Trials have become increasingly expensive and protracted. Most Canadians cannot afford to sue when they are wronged or defend themselves when they are sued, and cannot afford to go to trial. Without an effective and accessible means of enforcing rights, the rule of law is threatened. Without public adjudication of civil cases, the development of the common law is stunted.</P>
<P>Increasingly, there is recognition that a culture shift is required in order to create an environment promoting timely and affordable access to the civil justice system.</P>
<P>This shift entails simplifying pre-trial procedures and moving the emphasis away from the conventional trial in favour of proportional procedures tailored to the needs of the particular case. The balance between procedure and access struck by our justice system must come to reflect modem reality and recognize that new models of adjudication can be fair and just.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>F.</N><TI>The trial judge was required by law to determine whether Alan's claim passed the threshold.</TI>
<P>72. Section 267.5(15) if the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, supra, requires that, in the absence of a motion before trial, the trial judge <BOLD>must</BOLD> determine whether a plaintiff is entitled claim non-pecuniary damages arising from a motor vehicle accident:

<P>73. The Appellant had the onus of demonstrating that he had suffered a &ldquo;permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or psychological function&rdquo; under subsection 267.5(3) and (5) of <EM>the Insurance Act</EM>, supra. Section 4.2(1) of the <EM>Court Proceedings for Automobile Accidents that Occur on or After November 1, 1996</EM> sets out the criteria that must be met in order for the court to make such a finding. Section 4.2(1)1, which contains the requirements for a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; impairment, provides:
<QUOTE><P>1. The impairment must,</P>
<P>i. Substantially interfere with the person's ability to continue his or her regular or usual employment, despite reasonable efforts to accommodate the person's impairment and the person's reasonable efforts to use the accommodation to allow the person to continue employment,</P>
<P>ii. Substantially interfere with the person's ability to continue training for a career in a field in which the person was being trained before the incident, despite reasonable efforts to accommodate the person's impairment and the person's reasonable efforts to use the accommodation to allow the person to continue his or her career training, or</P>
<P>iii. Substantially interfere with the most of the usual activities of daily living, considering the person's age.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>74. Having regard to his Accident related functional impairments, including an inability to work, Alan met the test established by section 267.5 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> for entitlement to sue the respondents.</P>
<P>75. Contrary to section 267.5(15), Justice Myers declined to decide whether Alan had been left with &ldquo;threshold impairments&rdquo; on the basis that he considered the issue to be moot.</P>
<P>76. The <EM>Interpretation Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1&ndash;21, section 11 provides:

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. As stated by the appellant, &ldquo;The overarching issue in this trial was whether the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that his medical conditions (in particular his shoulder issues) were caused by the accident.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para. 50. In addition, there were real questions whether the non-objective complaints made by the appellant were exaggerated or even genuine, and whether he sustained pecuniary losses as claimed.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. The jury's answers make it abundantly clear that they found that the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of an impact which the trial judge described as a &ldquo;trivial contact&rdquo; were insignificant in nature.</P>
<P>3. The mildness of the impact is evidence sufficient in itself to have enabled the jury to arrive at their conclusion. There was other evidence as well, in particular expert medical evidence, which similarly was fully capable of supporting the jury's verdict.</P>
<P>4. This appeal boils down to a request that this court retry the case, arrive at a different conclusion, and substitute its opinion for that of the jury.</P>
<P>5. The appellant's submissions regarding misdirection of the jury and misconduct of the trial judge are long on generalities and short on specifics. Only a single instance is cited by the appellant in regard to each issue, and in neither case does it support his arguments. In point of fact, there was neither any misdirection of the jury nor any misconduct by the trial judge.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. The respondents accept as correct the facts set out in paragraphs 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20 and 29 of the appellant's factum. They also accept as correct the facts in paragraph 5, subject to the qualification that the jury was asked to assess damages only for those injuries and losses that resulted from the accident. The respondents furthermore agree that evidence was led at trial as generally outlined in the appellant's factum, without accepting the truth or correctness of much of that evidence.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Accident</TI>
<P>7. The appellant was a front-bucket-seat passenger in a 2007 Chevrolet Uplander, described by the involved automobile property damage appraiser, Mark Uyeda of Northbridge Insurance, as &ldquo;a big large seven passenger van&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 1132-33 lines 26-1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that was being operated by his wife.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 379-80 lines 23-2; 381-82 lines 29-6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The respondent Fakhim was driving a Dodge Nitro, which is a small SUV.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 872 lines 15&ndash;18; 875 lines 9&ndash;13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. The respondent Fakhim testified that she was stopped behind a big van, which itself was stopped for a red light. When the light changed to green, she assumed the vehicle ahead would start to go. &ldquo;I took my foot off the brake and that's it. So it was just a little bit of impact.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 874 lines 22&ndash;30; 879-80 lines 22&ndash;8; 881-82 lines 31&ndash;16; Exhibit 12,</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Fakhim said that the only damage to her vehicle were a few scratches. The vehicle was drivable after the accident. Because the damage was so minor, the respondent Univar, her employer and the lessee of the vehicle, decided not to make repairs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 876 lines 19&ndash;31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. She testified that the police officer said it was a very minor accident and that if they wanted to make a report they should go to the Collision Centre,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 876 lines 8&ndash;15; 877 lines 10&ndash;16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the police officer indicated on the Self-Reporting Collision Report that the damage to the Dodge Nitro was &ldquo;Front scratched only&rdquo; and estimated the repair cost at $100.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 879 lines 12&ndash;21; Exhibit 12, tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. After the accident, the appellant saw some scuffing and a crack in the rear bumper of his van.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 227 lines 15&ndash;23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The van was drivable and the cost of repairs came to $1,401.42.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 228 lines 5&ndash;17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. The trial judge said: &ldquo;The contact between the cars was slight&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> &ldquo;[There was a] trivial contact between the parties' vehicles&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and &ldquo;[The jury clearly found that there was] transient soft tissue injury from auto contact that barely qualifies as a fender bender.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Evidence Regarding Causation</TI>
<P>13. The appellant first saw Dr. Forman, his family doctor, on July 8, 2009, 4 days after the accident. Dr. Forman found no neurological abnormalities, but the appellant had muscle tenderness and limited range of motion of the neck. Dr. Forman referred the appellant to a chiropractor for soft tissue management.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 67 lines 5&ndash;27; 68 lines 16&ndash;19; 156 lines 10&ndash;16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. Dr. Forman made no notation of any shoulder problem on the July 8, 2009 visit, nor was the appellant complaining of headache or jaw pain.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 68-69 lines 27-2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Dr. Zabieliauskas, a qualified physiatrist, gave the following evidence:
<QUOTE><P>[H]aving reviewed the totality of all of the information, I don't believe that any injury occurred in either shoulder as a result of this accident. There's no supporting documentation from the family physician that would support that the shoulders were injured immediately. As I stated earlier, when you've got pain in your shoulders and you've got inflammation, you know it...It's immediate, and that's the most important thing to take away here, that shoulders, when they are injured and strained, you feel it immediately. Just ask any baseball pitcher who's strained a rotator cuff and ends up with a tendinopathy. You'd know it immediately. And, so the most important thing to take away from this case is that it was a crack in the bumper, there was a strain of a neck, strain of the upper neck and a bump on the right knee, which is what the family physician initially reported four days later and that would be the key critical visit, the first visit by the family physician.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 941 lines 9&ndash;31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>These are all temporary conditions that heal quickly, and that's consistent with my physical examination in terms of the neck, upper back...and the right knee where there were no significant physical findings by the time I saw him [on October 11, 2012],<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 942-43 lines 24-1; 978 line 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>16. Dr. Zabieliauskas also said that, in his opinion, any chronic pain experienced by the appellant could not be linked to the car accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 944-45 lines 20-13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He agreed in cross-examination that he did not dispute the appellant's complaints of debilitating pain, and that the essence of his opinion was that the pain was not related to the accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 947-48 lines 29-10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. When asked what other event could have caused the shoulder problems, Dr. Zabieliauskas said &ldquo;Anything could have happened.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 962 lines 2&ndash;6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appellant's expert, Dr. Richards, said that there are probably a dozen or more causes of tendinopathy, trauma being one of them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 669-70 lines 26&ndash;8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. Dr. Ford, an orthopaedic surgeon, gave the following evidence:
<QUOTE><P>[T]here's no such thing as any post-traumatic condition that's pain-free for days and then suddenly becomes painful...when there's a pain-free interval like that, then it means that there's no causal relationship. It just can't be related, especially when you're dealing with conditions that are...more likely to be spontaneous in onset than secondary to any trauma. And the pain from AC joint arthritis is commonly spontaneous in onset...Just because someone has pain and had an accident doesn't mean that the two are causally linked. That's a fallacious argument. It's a common logical fallacy because it doesn't fit with our understanding of what happens at the cellular level, what happens with respect to the pathophysiology of any traumatic event...pain coming on days after a car accident, you can't say that it's causally related. It's not possible to do that, to say so. It is an incredible stretch and exceeds&mdash;does not jive with our understanding of what happens after a traumatic event at the cellular level.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 1090&ndash;92 lines 24-12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. Dr. Ford said that this very minor accident was &ldquo;an extremely common mechanism, and so we wouldn't expect any significant injuries. At the most, minor soft tissue injuries that resolve very quickly, but not something that's going to result in years of pain.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 1090&ndash;92 lines 31&ndash;6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Dr. Ford said:
<QUOTE><P>There's no causal link between the subsequent shoulder surgeries and the motor vehicle accident, and given the mechanism, as I said, one would not have expected any serious injuries. They would have resolved within a short period of time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1093 lines 19&ndash;25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>As I said, given the mechanism, we would have expected either no injuries whatsoever, [or] at the very most, minor soft tissue injuries that would resolve within a short period of time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1094 lines 14&ndash;17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>There's nothing objective. You know, there's no objective evidence here of any pathology that we could definitely say is post-traumatic that would seriously interfere with an individual's ability to work at a sedentary job. There just isn't.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1094 lines 22&ndash;31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. When asked whether it was reasonable to say that the family doctor's notes may not have been complete, Dr. Ford's response was: &ldquo;[I]t just doesn't make any sense to me that supposedly this [the shoulder problem] is the most significant problem...[a]nd yet he [the family doctor] doesn't record it in his notes and it's not recorded by Dr. Blitzer either.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1114 lines 12&ndash;23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Dr. Zabieliauskas similarly testified that it was unlikely that the family doctor would have omitted that sort of information in his notes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 963 lines 13&ndash;28</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>

<P>22. Counsel for the appellant made the following closing submissions to the jury:
<QUOTE><P>How does something like that [chronic pain] come from a small accident? I acknowledge that's the tough part of my case with you. It's easy to be cynical and say it doesn't accord with common sense that a minor accident could cause these problems.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 61 lines 2&ndash;12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>So, the easy answer for me is to say to you, Alan told you he had those complaints right after the accident and you should accept that from him. I want to go past that though, because obviously I recognize that maybe you're not going to be so quick to just take what Alan says at face value.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 63 lines 5&ndash;10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>Just because it isn't in Dr. Forman's note, doesn't mean that you should infer that it didn't happen. So, then you're left back to, do you believe Alan Mandel?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 71 lines 10&ndash;13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>Now, the thing with temporal causation is the closer together two things happen, the easier it is, the more realistic it is for you to infer that one is related to the other. The greater the duration between t he two events, the harder it is to make the linkage.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 71 lines 22&ndash;28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>The answer to what may seem to be a non-common sense proposition, how can a minor accident have caused these problems, is that every doctor told you that not everybody heals the same.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 75 lines 2&ndash;5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Pre-charge Submissions Regarding the Charge to the Jury</TI>
<P>23. The following exchange occurred between appellant's counsel and the trial judge:
<QUOTE><P>MR. RACHLIN: ...the final point on this in this vein is your paragraph 105, and in my submission, again all of it invites a particular viewpoint and is inappropriate.</P>
<P>THE COURT: 105 that says, &ldquo;You know there was a minor collision&rdquo;?</P>
<P>MR. RACHLIN: Yes. As I said to you, I don't suggest that anything you've said individually is wrong or it's unfairly summarizing it. The point is that by bringing all of it together, any paragraph in the sequence that it did, I submit a jury could well see it as an expression of a viewpoint by Your Honour which has the potential to unduly influence the jury.</P>
<P>THE COURT: Let's say not this case. Let's say another case where a party has a weak defence on a particular issue. The judge is supposed to summarize the evidence. What do you do if the evidence is here and not here or the evidence goes one way and not the other? I mean you can't create a balance if there isn't one. So I'm a little concerned about this. You say individually the facts are right...I've put them together in a way that you are concerned might suggest an intended outcome to the jury.</P>
<P>MR. RACHLIN: Right.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1212 lines 7&ndash;32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>After consideration of the objections and concerns raised by the appellant's counsel regarding the proposed charge, the trial judge subsequently said:
<QUOTE><P>I can tell you that I made changes [to the charge to the jury] to most areas where I tried to at least take into account the submissions that were made. So I've added or down&mdash;tried to soften where you argued that things were too one-sided...I have made sure that I'm satisfied in the charge that I have stressed the jury's independent role and I have satisfied myself that I am raising questions not giving, inappropriately crossing the line.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1223 lines 12&ndash;32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Charge to the Jury</TI>
<P>24. The trial judge repeatedly and emphatically instructed the jury that they were the sole triers of fact,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Charge to the jury, page 1228 line 4; 1228-29 lines 29-7; 1244 lines 6&ndash;9; 1248 lines 28&ndash;31; 1251 lines 8&ndash;13; 1280 lines 5&ndash;10; 1292-93 lines 28-1;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> commencing with the following instruction:
<QUOTE><P>While I am the judge of the law, you have the sole authority to determine the facts. As jurors, it is your exclusive duty to decide all questions of fact submitted to you, and for that purpose, to determine the effect and value of the evidence. No matter what I say as I may summarize the facts and issues for you, on questions of fact, on weighing the evidence, on deciding what happened in this case, it is your view and only your view that matters<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Charge to the jury, pages 1226-27 lines 32&ndash;9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>25. The trial judge concisely and correctly instructed the jury as to the law of causation:
<QUOTE><P>For the defendant to be held liable to pay damages to the plaintiff, it is not necessary that the motor vehicle accident be the sole cause of an injury or injuries. It is good enough if the collision was a cause of the injury or injuries. You need not be satisfied that there was causation on the basis of scientific precision. Whether the collision caused a particular injury is essentially a practical question of fact that can best be answered by ordinary common sense. The Supreme Court of Canada says that cause looks at whether the plaintiff would have incurred the injuries that you find occurred but for the collision. That is, but for the car accident, would Mr. Mandel have suffered the injuries that you find he has suffered, if any.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1274 lines 5&ndash;19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>You will have to consider the evidence concerning the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and assess whether any injuries that you believe occurred would have occurred but for the car accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1275 lines 10&ndash;14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>The essential purpose and most basic principle of negligence law is to restore the plaintiff to the position he would have enjoyed but for the defendant's negligence...You would award damages only for those injuries that you find on the evidence were brought about or made worse as a result of the 2009 motor vehicle accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1277 lines 18&ndash;31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. The trial judge provided the following instructions as to the matter of whether a temporal connection can be used to find a causal connection:
<QUOTE><P>In assessing causation, it's important to avoid the logical fallacy of automatically assuming a causal connection between two events just because one closely follows the other in time...You have to look at all the evidence and see if [the appellant] has proven that but for the motor vehicle accident he would not have incurred his losses. Timing is an important factor, but you are to look at all the evidence...This is a common sense exercise. Scientific precision is not required to prove causation. The Supreme Court of Canada says that the triers of fact should take into account all the evidence before them, factual, scientific, statistical, and apply your normal, good common sense to establish that an event caused injury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 1278-79 lines 1&ndash;10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>27. The trial judge said the following in regard to claims for chronic pain:
<QUOTE><P>I want to be very clear on one point. Our law recognizes the existence of chronic pain. The Supreme Court of Canada has discussed it and says, &ldquo;There is no doubt that chronic pain patients are suffering and in distress and that the disability they experience is real.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1280 lines 22&ndash;27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>As a matter of law, I instruct you that chronic pain exists and can be compensated in damages. The questions for you [are] whether, on the evidence that you accept, you find the plaintiff suffers chronic pain, and, if so, whether it was caused by the motor vehicle accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1281 lines 4&ndash;9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Objections Made by Appellant's Counsel Regarding the Charge to the Jury</TI>
<P>28. The following exchange occurred between counsel for the appellant and the trial judge after the charge to the jury:
<QUOTE><P>MR. RACHLIN: I'm simply submitting to you that without something more that helps the jury to better understand that the interval between events is a relevant consideration to their deliberation. They may be led down an unwarranted path by your instruction. So, I don't say that there's anything that's wrong with what you've said. I simply suggested that it's insufficient to help them to understand that issue. You know, going back to the example yesterday. If you have an event that manifests itself within seconds of an accident, temporal causation is no big deal. But the further the one event gets from the other, the more difficult the analysis becomes.</P>
<P>THE COURT: Okay, thank you. I understand what you're saying. I look at paragraph 121 [of the charge] where I said, &ldquo;...the simple fact that something came first and something else came after does not automatically or necessarily prove causation.&rdquo; And then I give the vaccine quote. I don't see that as denying the importance or the relevancy of temporal. Rather, it just says that temporal isn't in and of itself necessarily enough, and in the next paragraph I say that timing is an important factor, right before I&mdash;as I'm in the midst of telling the jury to look at all the relevant factors. So, I think that what you're asking for, Mr. Rachlin, actually overplays&mdash;overplays the importance of temporal causation and I think I got a fair balance that I'm going to leave.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Pages 1311-12 lines 28&ndash;25.

<P>29. <EM>General standard of review</EM>: The general standard of review applicable to an appeal from a jury verdict is that it must be &ldquo;so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Goodwin v Olupona</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 259</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>. &ldquo;In construing the jury's findings, we must not apply an overly rigorous critical method.

<P>31. <EM>Issues of fact&mdash;causation</EM>: The major issue on this appeal is causation; more particularly, the jury's finding, as reflected in their assessment of damages, that the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of the accident were insignificant in nature.</P>
<P>32. Causation is an issue of fact.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ediger (Guardian ad litem of) v Johnston</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 18</CITE><PARANUM>29</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is now trite law that the standard of review in regard to an issue of fact is &ldquo;palpable and overriding error&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ediger</EM>, at para. 29, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 9</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<BLOCK2><TI>Whether the Charge Misdirected the Jury on the Matter of Finding Causation through a Temporal Connection</TI>
<P>37. The appellant refers to only one specific comment made by the trial judge in his charge to the jury relating to this issue, saying that these were &ldquo;obscure instructions&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para. 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. That specific comment of the trial judge was both correct as to the law, and was helpful in making the issue of causation more readily understandable by a lay jury.</P>
<P>39. The extract from the charge to the jury reproduced at para. 26 above clearly shows that the trial judge did not say that a temporal connection is not a relevant factor for consideration and should be ignored. What he said, in effect, was that a temporal connection is not a <EM>conclusive</EM> factor on the causation issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See the comment by the trial judge reproduced in para. 28 above.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> His instructions were correct and accurate and were in accord with those desired by the appellant.</P>
<P>40. In addition, the exchange between counsel for the appellant and the trial judge during objections to the charge<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Again reproduced in para. 28 above.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> shows that the trial judge was alive to the concern expressed by counsel and had adopted a balanced and fair approach in dealing with it.</P>
<P>41. Furthermore, there was expert medical evidence, which the jury was entitled to, and clearly did, accept, that the type of temporal connection which existed in this case&mdash;one that was far from immediate&mdash;simply did not qualify as evidence of a causal connection. To the contrary, the experts testified that that evidence showed an <EM>absence</EM> of a causal connection.</P>
<P>42. The test for jury instructions is not whether they are &ldquo;obscure&rdquo;, but rather whether they fairly and sufficiently explain the factual matters to be considered by the jury and the principles of law to be applied to factual findings.</P>
<P>43. As might be expected, there are numerous decisions that bear upon this issue. Relevant comments include the following:
<QUOTE><P>We take the functional approach as the applicable analytical framework for the assessment of the adequacy of a jury instruction...Applying that functional approach, when reading this record as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury was provided with adequate explanation of the factual issues it was to resolve, the evidence that related to those issues, the proper law to be applied, and the positions of the parties.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Berthiaume-Palmer v Borgundvaag</SOC><CITE>2010 ONCA 470</CITE><PARANUM>15-16</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>An appellate court must examine any alleged error in a trial judge's jury instructions in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole. Appellate courts should not examine minute details of a jury instruction in isolation because it is the overall effect of the charge that matters. Although the language appellants' trial counsel proposed might have been preferable in the circumstances, the trial judge's choice of words did not mislead the jury...Having regard to the charge in its entirety, the jury would have understood the law concerning the plaintiff's onus.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Surujdeo v Melody</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 41</CITE><PARANUM>75-76</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>. Also: &ldquo;[A party is] entitled to a properly instructed jury, not one that was perfectly instructed. A jury charge is proper if, taken as a whole, the charge leaves the jury with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the issues the jury must or may have to decide&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v Tomlinson</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 158</CITE><PARANUM>171</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 17</BOLD>.

<P>44. The appellant makes the following additional submissions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para. 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The respondents' response is set out after each point:
<ITEM><P>The instructions were wrong at law and misleading in that they involved non-material examples.
<QUOTE><P><EM>Examples can usually be described as &ldquo;non-material&rdquo;&mdash;that is what makes them &ldquo;examples&rdquo;</EM>. <EM>The examples given by the trial judge were entirely appropriate and helpful in making the issue more understandable. They were not &ldquo;wrong at law&rdquo; (no authority is cited for that assertion), nor were they &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The instructions were wrong at law and misleading in that they undermined the appellant's valid assertion regarding the very close and well-documented temporal connection between the accident and his shoulder injuries.
<QUOTE><P><EM>There was a loose, not a &ldquo;very close&rdquo;, temporal connection between the accident and the alleged shoulder problems. The appellant does not specify how the jury charge &ldquo;undermined&rdquo; what he incorrectly describes as a &ldquo;valid assertion regarding the very close and well-documented temporal connection between the accident and his shoulder injuries&rdquo;. The jury obviously rejected the appellant's argument that that loose connection was sufficient proof that those injuries were caused by the accident. As indicated by the maxim post hoc ergo propter hoc, a temporal connection, even if very close, is far from sufficient proof of a causal connection. There was ample expert evidence that a 10-day delay in reporting shoulder problems ruled out any causal connection. The jury was entitled to accept that evidence, and clearly did so</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The instructions were wrong at law and misleading in that they failed to account for the complete absence of any other explanation for the shoulder injuries.
<QUOTE><P><EM>The onus of proof as to causation rested with the appellant</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Clements (Litigation guardian of) v Clements</SOC><CITE>2012 SCC 32</CITE><PARANUM>6</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 7</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>The respondents had no onus, nor for that matter any ability, to show what may have caused the shoulder problems. Nor did the jury have any obligation to determine what may have caused the problems. Furthermore, as the trial judge told the jury, Dr. Richards testified that there are probably a dozen or more causes of tendinopathy, trauma being only one of them, and as Dr. Zabieliauskas said: &ldquo;Anything could have happened.&rdquo; The simple fact is that the jury rejected the appellant's evidence that the shoulder problems were causally connected to the accident, and the appellant failed to satisfy his onus of proof</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P></ITEM></P>
<P>45. Another submission made by the appellant is that &ldquo;There is no legal principle that holds that if a collision is not severe or violent, or if there is no significant damage to a motor vehicle, the individual seated within that vehicle at the time of the impact cannot have sustained injuries.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para. 44.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. No one disputes that statement, but it leads nowhere on this appeal. The trial judge did not instruct the jury that the appellant <EM>could not have</EM> sustained injuries because the impact was trivial in nature. He merely told them that this was a factor to be considered. There was no error in doing so.</P>
<P>47. The appellant's submission implies that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that a serious injury from a very minor collision was a likely consequence. That, of course, would have been an entirely incorrect instruction.</P>
<P>48. The trial judge, in any event, properly instructed the jury, both with respect to the matter of chronic pain,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The relevant passages from the charge regarding chronic pain are reproduced at para. 27 above.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and as follows:
<QUOTE><P>You can find that [the appellant] suffered shoulder injuries. You can find he suffered neck injuries. You can find he suffered headaches. You can find any combination of those physical injuries and that any of the physical injuries has or have continued as chronic pain, whether physical or psychological. You can find he suffered no physical injuries, but he has psychological chronic pain as a result of the motor vehicle accident. You can find that he suffered nothing or everything that he claims as a result of the accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Page 1291 lines 21&ndash;32. It might also be noted that the charge included the following remark: &ldquo;Dr. Zabieliauskas accepts that bracing can cause shoulder injury in a minor car accident&rdquo;: Page 1260 lines 9-10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>49. The following statements apply here:

<BLOCK2><TI>Did the Charge to the Jury Deprive the Appellant of a Fair Trial?</TI>
<P>50. Many of the appellant's submissions on this issue involve generalities having little or no bearing on the specifics of this case.</P>
<P>51. The appellant makes reference to the following principles without, however, identifying any instances in which the trial judge contravened any of them:
<ITEM><P>The jury charge must be even-handed, balanced, and fair.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>There should be no prejudgment of issues or undue interventions by the trial judge.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>There must be no conduct on the part of the trial judge that creates a reasonable apprehension of bias.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>There must be a quality of objectivity to the jury charge.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The trial judge must not go too far in expressing an opinion.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The charge must not amount to a rebuttal of a party's address to the jury or unfairly denigrate or undermine the position of a party.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>52. The only concrete instance of alleged misconduct on the part of the trial judge that is provided is in regard to the alleged principle that the charge should not have directly or indirectly directed the jury to a conclusion inimical to the appellant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para, 62.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. The correct form of the principle is:
<QUOTE><P>A trial judge is entitled to express his own views of the facts or on the credibility of witnesses provided (i) he does not use such language as leads the jury to think that they must find the facts in the way he indicates and (ii) the charge does not deprive a party of a fair presentation of his case to the jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Surujdeo</EM>, at para. 71, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. The appellant cites the following single instance of alleged misconduct by the trial judge:
<QUOTE><P>In concatenating distinct pieces of evidence as he did (such as juxtaposing the dates when [the appellant] received nerve block injections with the dates when he was observed on surveillance), the trial judge, in effect, became a protagonist for the respondents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellant's factum, para. 62. The passage from the charge that is being referenced, part of which is reproduced at para. 35 of the appellant's factum, is (in fuller version): &ldquo;You saw the surveillance video[s], all but one of which was taken at least a week after Mr. Mandel had his most recent nerve block. Was it consistent with how Mr. Mandel described his pain and his functional limitations? The parties have agreed that in this case you can use the surveillance videos going both to Mr. Mandel's credibility as a witness and as independent evidence of Mr. Mandel's condition.&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. It cannot be said that this brief, isolated, and factually correct part of the charge &ldquo;led the jury to think that they must find the facts in the way the trial judge indicated, or that the charge deprived the appellant of a fair presentation of his case&rdquo;. In fact, the more complete version of the cited passage (which is reproduced in footnote 70 below) clearly shows that the trial judge did <EM>not</EM> indicate that there was any particular finding the jury was obligated to make.</P>
<P>56. The following comment made by the trial judge is relevant as well on this issue: &ldquo;I told the jury an obnoxious number of times that they, and only they, were the judges of the facts of the case.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 9. The numerous occasions on which the jury were told that are listed in footnotes 37 and 38 above.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The following statement applies:
<QUOTE><P>In the present case, the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that they, not he, were the triers of the facts. He specifically stated that if he commented on the evidence, they were &ldquo;in no way bound to follow my opinion insofar as the facts are concerned...if your views are at variance with mine, you must disregard my comments&rdquo;...</P>
<P>Nor did the trial judge's statement deprive the appellants of a fair presentation of their case on the Test Results Issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Surujdeo</EM>, at paras. 72-73, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Was the Jury Verdict was so Inordinately Low as to Permit Appellate Intervention?</TI>
<P>57. The appellant's submission on this issue &ldquo;is based on flawed reasoning&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Beidycki Estate</EM>, at para. 84, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The jury was not asked to assess damages in a vacuum. They were not asked to determine the nature and severity of the complaints made by the appellant and assess damages at large. They were asked to assess damages only in regard to those injuries and losses that were found by them to have resulted from the accident.</P>
<P>58. This is not, in other words, a standalone issue. This court must first find that the jury's determination regarding the insignificant nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the appellant <EM>as a result of the accident</EM> must be rejected, because otherwise the jury's assessment of damages was entirely reasonable.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Whether this Court should Substitute its own Assessment of Damages</TI>
<P>59. The same precondition applies here, but even if this court were to reject the jury's determination on the causation issue, it would not be entitled to make its own assessment of damages because the respondents are entitled to have that assessment made by a jury. As stated above, &ldquo;The assessment of damages is in the particular province of the jury.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Beldycki Estate</EM>, at para. 81, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. There was considerable evidence at trial that the appellant's injuries and losses were far less serious than alleged. That evidence, as well as evidence indicating that the appellant was not a credible witness, is not referenced in this factum because of its length and because those are not direct issues on the appeal.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Whether the Trial Judge was required to determine the Threshold Issue</TI>
<P>61. The respondents agree that there is some support for the appellant's position that the trial judge ought to have made a determination of the threshold issue.</P>
<P>62. The decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Kasap v MacCallum</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>(2001) 28 C.C.L.I. (3d) 18, Ont. C.A., Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> appears to be appellate authority for the proposition that, at least insofar as an earlier version of the threshold legislation is concerned,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 266(3) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a trial judge ought to make that determination regardless of the jury verdict, although the trial judge is not bound by that verdict.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Kasap</EM>, at para. 8, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 12</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. The respondents in fact brought the <EM>Kasap</EM> decision to the trial judge's attention, and he made reference to it in his reasons on the threshold issue.</P>
<P>64. The mootness issue was not considered in <EM>Kasap</EM>, and it should also be noted that s. 267.5(15) expressly states that the threshold determination is to be made only for the purposes of subsections (3) and (5)&mdash;i.e. only in regard to claims for health care expenses and non-pecuniary loss.</P>
<P>65. The &ldquo;modem approach to statutory interpretation&rdquo; requires the statutory provision to be read in its entire context, in the light of the object of the provision and the legislation as a whole, and the intention of the legislature. Furthermore,
<QUOTE><P>In interpreting a statutory provision, the court should take account of all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning. After taking these indicators into account, the court should adopt an interpretation that complies with the legislative text, promotes the legislative purpose, and produces a reasonable and sensible meaning.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kerr v Danier Leather Inc.</SOC><YEAR>2005</YEAR><CITE>77 O.R.

<P>66. The term &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is, in certain cases, read as directory rather than mandatory.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Old St. Boniface Residents Assn. Inc. v Winnipeg (City)</SOC><YEAR>1989</YEAR><CITE>58 D.L.R. (4th) 138</CITE><COURTJUR>Man. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 48&ndash;58, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 16</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A directory interpretation here accords with the principle cited above and is appropriate in a case where a threshold determination by the trial judge serves no useful purpose.</P>
<P>67. Had the trial judge made a threshold determination, and even had he made that determination in the appellant's favour, it would have had no effect on the ultimate outcome. The jury had already decided that the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of the accident were insignificant, and that determination was not going to be altered by any threshold determination made by the trial judge. He said: &ldquo;This jury has spoken and did so loud and clear.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 9. The trial judge also made the following comment (at para. 5 of the Threshold Endorsement): &ldquo;It is perfectly clear that the jury believed that the minor contact between the vehicles caused [the appellant] only very minor injuries and it awarded him very modest damages accordingly.&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>68. The trial judge's reasons for not making a threshold determination are highly persuasive. They produce a &ldquo;reasonable and sensible meaning&rdquo; for s. 267.5(15) in the context of the case.</P>
<P>69. In any event, as stated above: &ldquo;[I]n a civil case, a new trial will only be ordered where the interests of justice plainly require it&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Beldycki Estate</EM>, at para. 42, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 1</BOLD>; <EM>Caza</EM>, at para. 34, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. It cannot be said that &ldquo;the interests of justice plainly require&rdquo; a new trial merely because the trial judge failed to make a determination which may or may not have differed from the jury's governing determination, and where the result would not have changed regardless of the threshold determination. As the trial judge said: &ldquo;The plaintiff's recovery is the same regardless of the outcome of the threshold issue.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Threshold Endorsement, para. 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>71. This issue is revisited in Part IV below, where an associated principle statutorily established by s. 134(6) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> is considered.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>PART IV&mdash;OTHER ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Role of an Appellate Court</TI>
<P>72. It is not the role of an appellate court to retry the case:
<QUOTE><P>It is well-established that it is not open to an appellate court to retry the case or to substitute its opinion on the facts for the findings of the jury...[W]e do not propose to review the evidence in detail. Our role is limited to the question of whether the jury was properly instructed in law and, accordingly, it is upon that question that we focus our analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Berthiaume-Palmer</EM>, at para. 9, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>The jury must have found that contributory negligence on the part of the appellant had not been proved and that conclusion was open to it on the evidence. The respondents' argument on causation is little more than an invitation to this court to retry the case. We cannot accept this argument.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bella v Young</SOC><CITE>2006 SCC 3</CITE><PARANUM>61</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>There need be only &ldquo;some evidence&rdquo; to support the jury's determination</TI>
<P>73. This principle is shown in the following statements:
<QUOTE><P>Where there is some evidence to support the verdict, a jury will be accorded a high degree of deference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Goodwin</EM>, at para. 23, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>The respondents strongly dispute such a conclusion and do so with some good reason, but it was open to the jury on the evidence to take that view, and to assess damages accordingly. Their decision was not so aberrant that it could be said that no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could have made it. Accordingly, we would not interfere.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Bella</EM>, at para. 60, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 2</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>.....</P>
<P>While the appellants assert in their factum that the verdict was unreasonable, that submission quite properly was not pursued in oral argument as there was evidence which, if accepted by the jury, would support the verdict.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Berthiaume-Palmer</EM>, at para. 8, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>74. There was ample evidence in this case on which the jury could have found that the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of the accident were insignificant in nature:
<ITEM><P>The trivial nature of the impact.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The adjective &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; was used by the trial judge in the Threshold Endorsement at para. 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The absence of any complaint by the appellant of shoulder problems until 10 days after the accident.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The evidence given by the respondents' medical experts regarding the absence of a causal connection between the accident and the shoulder problems.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The evidence of the respondents' medical experts that the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of the accident were almost certainly insignificant in nature.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>The jury's obvious rejection of the credibility of the appellant.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>75. &ldquo;This finding was open to the jury...It may be that another jury would have reached a different decision on the facts of this unfortunate case...However, it cannot be said that no jury, reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially, could have reached the decision that this jury did.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Hamilton</EM>, at para. 18, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 11</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>76. While the possibility exists that a minor impact can result in a serious injury, common sense dictates that that would be a rare outcome. The closing argument to the jury ma de by counsel for the appellant (reproduced at para. 22 above) effectively concedes that point. The appellant seeks to have this court substitute a highly unlikely result for the highly probable result adopted by the jury.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Section 134(6) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM></TI>
<P>77. This subsection provides:
<QUOTE><P>A court to which an appeal is taken shall not direct a new trial unless some <UNDER>substantial wrong</UNDER> or <UNDER>miscarriage of justice</UNDER> has occurred, [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>78. The effect of s. 134(6) has been explained as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[E]ven where the trial judge misdirects the jury, &ldquo;it will generally not be sufficient for an appellant to demonstrate simply that it was open to the jury on the evidence to reach a different result. Something more than that is required&rdquo;...[There are] three possibilities that &ldquo;[a]n appellant may demonstrate: 1) that the case was not fairly put to the jury, as, for example, where the charge leaves the jury with a misapprehension as to the applicable legal principles; 2) that the charge was materially deficient; or 3) that the law was not clearly stated on a critical issue&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Berthiaume-Palmer</EM>, at para. 17, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>79. &ldquo;The issue is whether the charge was &lsquo;materially deficient&rsquo;&rdquo;. No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was found to have occurred where the charge &ldquo;got the job done&rdquo; and did not &ldquo;give rise to a serious concern as to whether the appellant received a fair trial&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Berthiaume-Palmer</EM>, at para. 19, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>80. A context-specific analysis to determine fairness is conducted as follows:
<QUOTE><P>An appeal court should look at the charge in the context of the entire trial and ask if the jury would have understood the issues of fact, the relevant legal principles, how the facts related to the law and the positions of the parties, and only order a new trial when the appeal court is satisfied that the trial judge's errors have caused a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Berthiaume-Palmer</EM>, at para. 20, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 3</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>81. The onus rests with the appellant to establish that an error made by the trial judge (assuming there <EM>was</EM> an error) produced some &ldquo;substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Surujdeo</EM>, at para. 95, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 18</BOLD>; <EM>Goodwin</EM>, at para. 80, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 10</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>82. A new trial was not ordered even in the following circumstances:
<QUOTE><P>The trial judge's charge contained some errors. On a few occasions, he misstated the evidence and on one instance he misstated a legal principle...In addition, I think it is fair to say that the trial judge's review of the evidence may have led the jury to believe that he was sympathetic to the respondent's version of events, although he does not specifically say that was the case. That said, the trial judge was careful to repeat on several occasions that it was the jury's view of the facts, not his, that should govern their decision.</P>
<P>I have read the charge carefully and I am not satisfied that the overall tenor of the trial judge's charge was unfair or that it resulted in a miscarriage of justice. As I have said above, there was an evidentiary basis to support the jury's verdict.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Caza</EM>, at paras. 39-40, Respondents' Book of Authorities, <BOLD>Tab 6</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>83. This was a lengthy trial (12 days). The parties were represented by competent and experienced counsel. The charge was comprehensive (81 pages), balanced, and fair. The claim arose from a minor motor vehicle accident and the issue of causation (the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of that accident) was straightforward. As submitted above, there was ample evidence on which the jury could find that the injuries resulting from the accident were insignificant in nature.</P>
<P>84. This is not one of those rare cases where an appellate court is entitled to interfere with a jury's verdict.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
