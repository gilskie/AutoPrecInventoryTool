<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>The appellant (&ldquo;Veracity&rdquo;) undertook a tax plan to minimize provincial tax on the sale of its shares in ALL But for the tax plan, Veracity would have been liable for BC income tax on the entire capital gain realized on the sale.</P>
<P>The linchpin of the plan was a Quebec law that permitted Veracity to choose a taxation year for Quebec purposes that did not coincide with its taxation year for BC or federal tax purposes. Veracity established a taxable presence in Quebec and exercised that choice. In the result, only 10% of Veracity's capital gain was taxed in BC. The balance was not taxed in Quebec (or any other province).</P>
<P>BC, relying on the general anti-avoidance rule in the BC Act (the &ldquo;BC GAAR&rdquo;), reassessed Veracity on the basis that 100% of the capital gain was subject to BC income tax. The judge concluded that the reassessment was correct. That conclusion is wrong in law.</P>
<P>The judge's fundamental error was his assumption that Veracity's capital gain &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to have been provincially taxed &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;. This incorrect assumption derailed the judge from conducting a disciplined analysis of the relevant provisions of the BC Act, as mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada.</P>
<P>Quebec deliberately adopted a tax regime that did not harmonize with federal law or the law of other provinces. Differences in provincial tax regimes inevitably and expectedly lead to some income not being provincially taxed. It is not the role of the BC GAAR to override a tax policy choice made by Quebec. The provincial GAAR decisions of other appellate courts have established that taking advantage of interprovincial differences is not abusive tax avoidance.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The facts are set out in the judge's reasons and are not in dispute. Although Veracity does not agree with all of the judge's findings of fact, it does not allege that any of those findings should be reversed for palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>2. In anticipation of the sale of ALI shares to McKesson, Mr. Peet proceeded with a tax plan known as the &ldquo;Quebec Year-End Shuffle&rdquo; (Q-YES).

<P>3. Pursuant to the Q-YES plan, Mr. Peet and Pi Capital, Mr. Peet's holding company, undertook the following transactions with the following provincial income tax consequences (see also the timeline chart in the Appendix):

<QUOTE><BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Incorporation of Veracity and choice of June 30 as its fiscal year end</UNDER></TI>
<P>(a) On June 10, 2002, Veracity was incorporated under the laws of BC. At all relevant times, Veracity was potentially liable for income tax under the BC Act because it had a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; in BC.
<P1>BC Act (<EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 215), ss. 2(2), 14(2), the definition of &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; in s. 1(1), and the definition of &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia&rdquo; in s. 13.3.</P1>
<P1>Federal Act (<EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.), s. 124(4) and federal <EM>Income Tax Regulations</EM>, C.R.C. c. 478, Reg. 400(1)-(2) (definitions of &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in a province&rdquo; and &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo;)</P1></P>
<P>(b) Veracity chose June 30 as the end of its corporate fiscal period, which automatically established its taxation year for federal/BC tax purposes. Its first federal/BC taxation year was June 10 to 30, 2002 and its second federal/BC taxation year was July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Veracity acquired the ALI shares on a &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; basis</UNDER></TI>
<P>(c) In June, 2002, Mr. Peet and Pi Capital transferred their shares of ALI to Veracity.</P>
<P>(d) Veracity, Mr. Peet and Pi Capital made joint elections pursuant to s. 85 of the federal Act, with these tax consequences;
<P1>i) Mr. Peet and Pi Capital were deemed to receive proceeds of disposition for the transferred ALI shares in an amount equal to their tax cost, so that Mr. Peet and Pi Capital realized no capital gain on the disposition.</P1>
<P1>ii) Veracity's cost of the ALI shares was deemed to be the tax cost of those shares to Mr. Peet and Pi Capital, so that <UNDER>Veracity</UNDER> would realize the entire deferred capital gain on a future sale of the ALI shares.</P1>
<P1>iii) Mr. Peet and Pi Capital received shares of Veracity with a tax cost equal to their cost of the ALI shares.

<P>(f) Veracity realized, in its federal/BC taxation year ended June 30, 2003, a capital gain on the sale of the ALI shares equal to the capital gain deferred by Mr. Peet and Pi Capital.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The rules for the allocation of taxable income to the provinces</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. Under the BC Act, the taxable income earned in BC of a corporation with a permanent establishment in BC is determined using the formula in the federal Act and regulations. The federal formula allocates the corporation's taxable income to all provinces in which the corporation has a permanent establishment. The income allocation formula in the Quebec Act and regulations allocates taxable income to Quebec in substantially the same way.
<P1>BC Act, ss. 2(2), 13.3, 14(2)</P1>
<P1>Federal Act, s. 124(4) and federal Reg. 400(1)</P1>
<P1>Quebec Act, s. 22, 27, 771, Reg 771R4</P1></P>
<P>5. The formulas allocate taxable income to a province based in equal part on (a) the proportion of gross revenues received in the province to total gross revenues, and (b) the proportion of salaries and wages paid in the province to total salaries and wages.</P></BLOCK2>

Under the provincial allocation formula as applied for that year, 100% of Veracity's salaries and wages paid (the director's fees) were attributable to BC, and it had no gross revenues from Gaz Metro or from any other source.

<P>11. If Veracity had chosen June 30 as its taxation year end for the purposes of the Quebec Act, the provincial allocation formula would have caused 89.8% of the taxable capital gain on the ALI shares to be taxable in Quebec. <UNDER>The BC allocation would still have been 10.2%</UNDER>.</P>
<P>12. Veracity concedes the following:
<P1>(a) When Veracity entered into the Q-YES Plan transactions, it intended to rely on the Quebec Act difference from the BC Act (and federal Act) relating to the permitted choice of taxation year end, so that most of the capital gain on the sale of the ALI shares would not be taxed under the BC Act, and none of it would be taxed under the Quebec Act.</P1>
<P1>(b) The Q-YES Plan transactions comprise a series of transactions undertaken primarily to obtain a &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo; as defined in the BC GAAR.</P1>
<P1>(c) The conditions in s. 68.1(1)(b) of the definition of &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo; in the BC GAAR are met.</P1>
<P1>(d) The exception in s. 68.1(1)(c) does not apply.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The reassessment</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. On December 28, 2011, the Minister of National Revenue reassessed Veracity for the federal/BC taxation year ended June 30, 2003.

<P>15. The judge erred in law when he failed to follow the statutory framework mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the GAAR jurisprudence, and in particular:
<P1>(a) he based his analysis on the false premise that the entire capital gain &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to have been subject to tax in a province, which i) derailed him from correctly applying the GAAR jurisprudence and ii) ignored the fact that there is no uniform system of provincial taxation;</P1>
<P1>(b) he concluded incorrectly that the BC GAAR could be applied to override an explicit tax policy choice made by Quebec;</P1>
<P1>(c) he failed to limit his analysis to statutory provisions that are within the scope of the BC GAAR; and</P1>
<P1>(d) he failed to determine correctly, or at all, the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the BC Act upon which Veracity relied to obtain the &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo; (as defined in the BC GAAR).</P1></P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The standard of review is correctness</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. All of the issues under appeal are questions of law, reviewable on appeal on the standard of correctness. As the judge failed to analyze the relevant statutory provisions, and did not properly determine the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant statutory provisions, the judge's findings on &ldquo;misuse or abuse&rdquo; are not entitled to deference.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Preliminary comment</UNDER></TI>
<P>17. The judge's observation that Veracity &ldquo;adopted contradictory positions&rdquo; about its taxable income allocation for purposes of the BC Act and the Quebec Act discloses a fundamental misapprehension of the applicable statutory schemes.
<P1>Reasons, AR, p. 48, &para;56</P1></P>
<P>18. What the judge characterized as a contradiction was the result of the differences between the taxation laws of BC and Quebec as to the permitted choice of taxation year ends. There was no inconsistency in Veracity's tax filings. Veracity simply applied the statutory income allocation formula to the circumstances that existed at the different taxation year ends.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The judge's fundamental error&mdash;his starting assumption</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. The judge's reasons for finding Veracity's tax planning abusive indicate that he assumed from the outset that Veracity's capital gain should have been subject to provincial tax. He said:
<QUOTE><P>This is a simple case of a tax not being paid anywhere which ought to have been paid somewhere.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons, AR, p. 39, &para;29</P1></P>
<P>20. This incorrect and unsupported assumption derailed the judge from correctly applying the disciplined approach mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada and adopted by various appellate courts regarding the interpretation and application of a general anti-avoidance rule. The fiscal policy relied on in a GAAR analysis must be grounded in the provisions of the applicable tax law and not the judge's notion of what the law &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be.</P>
<P>21. Contrary to the judge's assumption, there is no uniform system of provincial taxation in Canada that ensures all income is provincially taxed. The judge should have followed the reasoning of the appellate courts of Ontario and Alberta that acknowledged that lack of harmonization between provincial tax statutes may result in some amounts not being subject to provincial tax.</P>
<P>22. The following paragraphs contain:
<P1>(a) a summary of the analytical framework and basic principles for the application of a general anti-avoidance rule,</P1>
<P1>(b) a summary of the principles applicable to the BC GAAR; and</P1>
<P1>(c) a discussion of the judge's errors of law.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The interpretation and application of a general anti-avoidance rule</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. This is the first case to consider the BC GAAR and the first case to consider the GAAR of an &ldquo;agreeing province&rdquo;.</P>
<P>24. The BC GAAR is modelled on the federal GAAR in s. 245 of the federal Act. Although the two provisions are worded differently, their essential elements are the same. Therefore, it is appropriate to refer to the interpretation given to the federal GAAR in the extensive body of federal GAAR jurisprudence. This approach has been taken in other provincial GAAR cases.

<P>25. The GAAR does not interfere with the well-established principle that tax planning&mdash;arranging one's affairs so as to attract the least amount of tax&mdash;is a legitimate and accepted part of Canadian tax law. The GAAR applies only to tax avoidance that is abusive.

<P>26. The GAAR is an exceptional provision of last resort. It may override any provision of the tax statute, even if the taxpayer has fully complied with its literal requirements, but only if the object, spirit or purpose of that provision has been frustrated or defeated.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, &para;21</P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne</EM></UNDER>, &para;66</P1></P>
<P>27. The Supreme Court of Canada has established the following analytical framework to determine the application of the GAAR:
<P1>1. Three requirements must be established to permit application of the GAAR:
<P2>(1) <EM>A tax benefit resulting from a transaction</EM> or part of a series of transactions [...];</P2>
<P2>(2) that the transaction is an <EM>avoidance transaction</EM> in the sense that it cannot be said to have been reasonably undertaken or arranged primarily for a <EM>bona fide purpose</EM> other than to obtain a tax benefit; and</P2>
<P2>(3) that there was <EM>abusive tax avoidance</EM> in the sense that it cannot be reasonably concluded that a tax benefit would be consistent with the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions relied upon by the taxpayer.</P2></P1>
<P1>2. The burden is on the taxpayer to refute (1) and (2), and on the Minister to establish (3).
<P2><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, &para;66 (statutory references omitted; emphasis in original)</P2></P1></P>
<P>28. For purposes of this appeal, Veracity admits that there was a &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo; and an &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo; for purposes of the BC GAAR. The sole issue for determination is whether Veracity misused or abused a provision of the BC Act.</P>
<P>29. In determining whether there has been abusive tax avoidance, it is necessary first to identify the specific statutory provisions that give rise to the tax benefit. Then, the misuse or abuse analysis is a two-step process: (1) interpret the provisions giving rise to the tax benefit to determine their object, spirit or purpose; and then (2) determine whether the transaction in issue frustrates that purpose.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, &para;44</P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne</EM></UNDER>, &para;69&ndash;72</P1></P>
<P>30. This determination is not a moral judgment. Nor can it be based on the judge's own theory of appropriate taxing policy. As the Supreme Court of Canada explains:
<QUOTE><P>...determining the rationale of the relevant provisions of the Act should not be conflated with a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor with theories about what tax law ought to be or ought to do.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne</EM></UNDER>, &para;70</P1>
<P1>See generally, on the court's role, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. McLarty</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 26</CITE><PARANUM>75</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>31. The Crown must be precise in stating the purpose of the specific provisions alleged to give rise to the tax benefit, and in identifying the object or purpose of each provision that the Crown alleges has been abused or misused, referring not only to the statutory scheme but to any extrinsic material that informs the determination of the object and purpose of those provisions.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, &para;41, 64-65</P1></P>
<P>32. For a court to accept the existence of a fiscal policy advocated by the Crown, the policy must be anchored in the text of a specific provision of the relevant tax statute, not based on a vague &ldquo;overriding policy&rdquo; argument or moral opprobrium. In enacting the GAAR, Parliament intended to deter abusive tax avoidance while preserving legitimate tax planning, and therefore must be taken to have sought consistency, predictability and fairness in tax law.

<P>33. The GAAR cannot be used to override the explicit policy choice of a legislature. Even where a transaction takes advantage of a legislative gap, it is inappropriate to use the GAAR to fill that gap. To do so would place the formulation of tax policy in the hands of the judiciary, which was not intended by Parliament when the GAAR was enacted.

<P>34. The burden on the Crown to establish that a transaction is abusive tax avoidance is substantial. The abuse must be clear. If there is any doubt as to whether the transaction in issue is abusive, the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, &para;50, 66</P1></P>
<P>35. Examples drawn from leading federal and provincial GAAR cases demonstrate that the Crown's allegations of abuse have failed absent clear evidence that the purpose or policy of a specific provision has been frustrated or defeated.

<P>36. Veracity says that BC has not met&mdash;indeed has not approached&mdash;the high standard for applying the BC GAAR and the judge erred in finding there had been misuse or abuse of a provision of the BC Act.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The BC GAAR applies only to an abuse of a provision of the BC Act</UNDER></TI>
<P>37. A transaction or series of transactions will be subject to the BC GAAR, as it read at the relevant time, only if that transaction or series may reasonably be considered to result in a misuse or abuse of a provision of the BC Act. The relevant version of paragraph 68.1(1)(d) of the BC GAAR read as follows (emphasis added):
<QUOTE><P>In [section 68.1], &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo;... does not include a transaction that may reasonably be considered</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>(d) to be a transaction that would not result, directly or indirectly, in a misuse of the provisions of <UNDER>this Act</UNDER> or an abuse having regard to the provisions of <UNDER>this Act</UNDER>, other than this section, read as a whole.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>38. The limited scope of the BC GAAR can be contrasted with the Ontario GAAR, which applies to a misuse or abuse of the Ontario Act or &ldquo;any Act or regulation of any jurisdiction that is relevant in computing tax or any amount payable by or refundable to a corporation under this Act or in determining any amount relevant for the purposes of that computation&rdquo;.

<P>39. A similar issue of scope arose in the federal context where the Tax Court of Canada concluded in <UNDER><EM>Rousseau-Houle</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Fredette</EM></UNDER> that because the federal GAAR referenced only the federal Act, an abuse of the federal Regulations was not subject to the GAAR. The federal GAAR has since been amended to refer to an abuse of the federal Regulations.

<P>40. The BC Act and the BC GAAR must be interpreted in light of BC's status as an agreeing province. BC entered into a tax collection agreement with Canada under which BC agreed, in exchange for Canada's administration and collection of its taxes, to levy tax using the <UNDER>same taxable base</UNDER> as Canada. The BC GAAR cannot override BC's Tax Collection Agreement or its consequences.
<P1>(a) The taxable base is &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; as determined under the federal Act. BC makes no separate determination under the BC Act of &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia&rdquo; that differs from the determination of &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in a province&rdquo; of the federal Act.</P1>
<P1>(b) &ldquo;Taxable income&rdquo; has the same meaning in the BC Act and the federal Act. BC levies tax under the BC Act on a corporation's &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia&rdquo; as determined in accordance with the regulations made under the federal Act.
<P2>Tax Collection Agreement, ss. 2(1)(c), 2(3), 19</P2>
<P2>BC Act, ss. 1 and 13.3</P2>
<P2>Peter Hogg, Joanne Magee and Jinyan Li, <EM>Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law</EM>, 8th ed (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2013), 1.3(f), 15.5(b)(vi)</P2></P1></P>
<P>41. The BC Act incorporates by reference certain provisions of the federal Act not relevant in this case. However, the BC Act does not incorporate by reference the provisions of the federal Act by which &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; is calculated under the federal Act. Under the BC Tax Collection Agreement, BC accepts the federal determination of &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; and the BC GAAR cannot be interpreted to undermine that agreement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The judge erred in assuming there is a uniform system of provincial taxation</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. The judge made a fundamental legal error in conducting a GAAR analysis premised on the assumption that provincial tax &ldquo;ought to have been paid somewhere&rdquo;. Contrary to the judge's assumption, there is no uniform system of provincial taxation in Canada that ensures all income is provincially taxed.</P>
<P>43. Certain (&ldquo;agreeing&rdquo;) provinces, such as BC, have chosen to enter into tax collection agreements with Canada under which the provinces agree to use the same taxable base as Canada. This is intended to achieve &ldquo;simplicity, harmonization and uniformity&rdquo;, but only among the agreeing provinces and Canada.

<P>44. If all of the provinces were &ldquo;agreeing provinces&rdquo; there would be perfect harmonization, but this has never been achieved. At the time of the transactions in issue in this case, seven provinces, including BC, were &ldquo;agreeing provinces&rdquo; with respect to corporate income tax. Quebec was not.</P>
<P>45. As a non-agreeing province, Quebec establishes its own tax base and tax rules that may differ from those of Canada and the other provinces. The Quebec Act does not incorporate by reference any sections of the federal Act, as this would be viewed &ldquo;as a surrender by the Quebec government of its fiscal autonomy.&rdquo;
<P1><UNDER>Finances Quebec, <EM>Simplification of the Tax System</EM></UNDER>, (Quebec: Biblioth&eg;que nationale du Qu&ea;bec, 2004), p. 16)</P1></P>
<P>46. The benefits of uniformity and the risks associated with different provincial tax rules within Canada have been known by provincial governments for more than a century. As recently as 2000, the Federal Department of Finance warned the provinces that the logical result of maintaining different tax bases is that some amounts will be taxed twice and other amounts will avoid tax completely. Yet certain provinces, including Quebec, have chosen to remain as non-agreeing provinces.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>GAAR cases that address inter-jurisdictional differences in tax laws</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. In considering the difference in tax laws between BC and Quebec in this case, the judge should have followed the reasoning and approach of the appellate courts in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER>. In those cases, the appellate courts of Ontario and Alberta acknowledged that lack of harmonization between provincial tax statutes may result in some amounts escaping provincial tax entirely, and they concluded that tax planning to take advantage of such a result is not abusive. If the judge had followed those decisions, he would have concluded that it was not abusive for Veracity to take advantage of the difference in the Quebec taxation year rule in its tax planning.

<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER></P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER></P1></P>
<P>48. In <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER>, Alberta corporations claimed an Alberta deduction for interest paid on intercompany debt. The interest income on that debt was received by a related corporation with a taxable presence in Ontario but was not taxed by Ontario (or any province). The Alberta Minister of Finance asserted that the Alberta debtors' interest expense should be denied under the Alberta GAAR. The Alberta courts confirmed that the Alberta GAAR did not apply. The Alberta Court of Appeal said:
<QUOTE><P>...it would be a stretch to find abusive avoidance simply because a taxpayer took the benefit of another province's advantageous tax treatment.....This is especially so since differing provincial tax policies are a fundamental part of the Canadian federation.</P></QUOTE>

<P>49. In <UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER>, a BVI corporation established a taxable presence in Ontario by purchasing units of an Ontario limited partnership and received interest income from related corporations. The Ontario Minister of Revenue assessed the taxpayer on the basis that the interest income should be subject to Ontario tax and the judge upheld the Minister's assessment.</P>
<P>50. The Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the judge and concluded that the Ontario GAAR should not apply to tax the interest income. Although the taxpayer's tax minimization plan was designed to take advantage of a difference between Ontario and Alberta tax law, the Court found that the plan was not abusive. Justice Pardu acknowledged that:
<QUOTE><P>Differences in the thresholds for taxation as between the provinces or between a province and the federal government can give rise to gaps where some income escapes taxation and the other income may be subject to double taxation.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER>, &para;57</P1></P>
<P>51. In the international context, the non-taxation of income due to different taxation regimes was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in <UNDER><EM>MIL</EM></UNDER>. The Court concluded that the object, spirit or purpose of the particular international treaty exemption relied on by the taxpayer had not been abused, and that the provision should not be interpreted differently because double non-taxation might result. The Court held that the federal GAAR applies to the incidence of Canadian taxation and is not concerned with whether a foreign country taxes the revenue not taxed by Canada. Similarly in this case, the BC GAAR should not be concerned with whether Quebec taxes Veracity's income not allocated to BC.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The taxation year end provisions have not been abused</UNDER></TI>
<P>53. The burden is on the Crown to &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; demonstrate that Veracity abused a provision of the BC Act. The Crown cannot meet this high standard. To the contrary, Veracity satisfied the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the BC Act on which it relied.</P>
<P>54. The judge correctly identified, as the linchpin of this case, the right of a corporation to choose a different taxation year under the Quebec Act than under the BC Act. In the judge's words, the difference in Quebec law was the &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; employed:
<QUOTE><P>The entire plan pivoted on the anomalous provision in Quebec, prior to 2006, allowing a different year end to be selected for Quebec income tax purposes. Were it not for that, it would have been impossible to implement the Q-YES Plan.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Reasons, AR, p. 45, &para;45</P1></P>
<P>55. However, the judge erred in law when he concluded that &ldquo;the Plan abused legislative provisions for taxation years and fiscal year ends&rdquo;.
<P1>(a) The first error was in treating the legislative provisions for fiscal and taxation year ends in the federal Act, the BC Act, and the Quebec Act, as though they were parts of a single harmonious statutory scheme that is subject to the BC GAAR. They are not. Each of these provisions must be considered separately.</P1>
<P1>(b) The second error was in considering the statutory provision relating to a taxation year in the Quebec Act. That provision is not subject to the BC GAAR.
<P2>Reasons, AR, p. 49, &para;57</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) The third error was in finding that the taxation year provision of the BC Act had been abused.</P1></P>
<P>56. Veracity was a BC corporation. Veracity chose June 30 as its taxation year end for federal tax purposes and, because of that choice, June 30 automatically became its taxation year end for BC tax purposes. This was statutorily mandated because the meanings of &ldquo;taxation year&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; under the BC Act are defined as having the meanings in the federal Act.
<P1>BC Act, s. 1(1)</P1>
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 249(1), 249.1(1)</P1></P>
<P>57. The purpose of statutory requirement for a taxation year end is obvious. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in <UNDER><EM>Copthorne</EM></UNDER>:
<QUOTE><P>In some cases the underlying rational of a provision would be no broader than the text itself. Provisions that may be so construed, having regard to their context and purpose, may support the argument that the text is conclusive because the text is consistent with and fully explains its underlying rationale.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne</EM></UNDER>, &para;110</P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER>, &para;61</P1></P>
<P>58. In order to collect revenue on a regular basis, governments require taxable income to be determined and reported annually. On incorporation, a corporation can choose any taxation year for purposes of the federal Act, subject to the limit that it be less than 53 weeks. Once selected, a corporation cannot change its taxation year without the permission of the Minister.
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 150(1)(a), 249(1), 249.1(1) and 249.1(7)</P1></P>
<P>59. The purpose of the taxation year provisions of the federal Act and, thus, the BC Act, is to ensure that a taxpayer measures income each year. Veracity met that purpose simply by adopting a taxation year end for federal (and thus BC purposes) and reporting its income annually.
<P1>Brian Arnold et al, <EM>Timing and Income Taxation</EM>, 2nd ed (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 2015), pp. 115&ndash;119</P1></P>
<P>60. The Crown cannot discharge its burden of demonstrating that the object, spirit or purpose of the BC taxation year rule has been frustrated. Veracity did not abuse the federal/BC taxation year rule&mdash;it functioned exactly as intended.</P>
<P>61. The tax benefit in this case arose because the Quebec Act allowed for a choice of taxation year that differed from that of the BC Act. Contrary to the judge's conclusion that the relevant legislation &ldquo;did not contemplate a taxpayer using different fiscal year ends in different jurisdictions for the same income in the same year&rdquo;, the Quebec Act contemplated exactly that.</P>
<P>62. Veracity chose to establish a presence <UNDER>in Quebec</UNDER> and then to choose a taxation year <UNDER>for Quebec purposes</UNDER> that was different than its federal/BC taxation year. Veracity's taxable income which, under the federal income allocation rules, was considered allocated to Quebec (and, therefore, was not allocated to BC for the purposes of the BC Act), was not subject to Quebec tax because of a timing difference arising from the substantive provisions of the Quebec Act. Whether there was an abuse of the Quebec taxation year rule is not relevant to the BC GAAR. Provisions of the Quebec Act are not subject to the BC GAAR.</P>
<P>63. It is never the role of a GAAR to override a specific tax policy choice made by a legislature. To do so inappropriately places the formulation of tax policy in the hands of the judiciary. Not only does the Crown seek to have this Court apply the BC GAAR to override a specific tax policy choice made by a legislature, it is a choice made by another province. That is not permitted under the BC GAAR.</P>
<P>64. The possibility of a different Quebec taxation year was eliminated in 2008 when Quebec amended its legislation to remove over 80 separate &ldquo;Quebec choices&rdquo; to better align provisions of the Quebec Act with the federal Act. One of these conforming changes (retroactive to 2006) was to require that a corporation's taxation year for Quebec purposes be the same as for federal purposes.</P>
<P>65. Where legislation permits a choice of different taxation years, a taxpayer does not abuse that legislation by taking advantage of that difference to avoid tax. In <UNDER><EM>Imperial Oil</EM></UNDER>, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the scheme of the large corporation tax provisions in issue &ldquo;virtually invited the use of different corporate fiscal year ends&rdquo; for different corporations within a related group. A corporation that took advantage of that loophole to avoid the federal large corporation tax was held not to have engaged in abusive tax avoidance under the federal GAAR. Similarly in this case, Veracity did not engage in abusive tax avoidance under the BC GAAR when it took advantage of a different Quebec year end.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Imperial Oil</EM></UNDER>, &para;79-80</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The income allocation rules have not been abused</UNDER></TI>
<P>66. The judge concluded that the transactions undertaken by the taxpayer abused &ldquo;the legislative provisions related to the allocation of taxable income between provinces&rdquo;. That conclusion cannot stand because it is not based on a purposive and contextual analysis of the federal/BC income allocation rules.</P>
<P>67. Under the federal income allocation rules, the taxable income earned in a province is allocated among provinces in which a corporation has a taxable presence (&ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo;). Each &ldquo;agreeing province&rdquo;, including BC, accepts its income allocation under the federal rules as the taxable income upon which it may impose provincial corporate income tax. For BC, this agreement is set out in the BC Tax Collection Agreement and reflected in the BC Act.
<P1>Tax Collection Agreement, ss. 2(1)(c), 2(3), 19</P1>
<P1>BC Act, ss. 2(2), 13.3, 14(2)</P1>
<P1>Federal Act, Regulation 402(3)</P1></P>
<P>68. The non-agreeing provinces, such as Quebec, enact their own income allocation rules. While there are some differences between the Quebec income allocation rules and the federal/BC income allocation rules, none are relevant in this case. In this case, for all practical purposes the federal/BC income allocation rules and Quebec income allocation rules are identical and functioned as intended.
<P1>Smith, pp. 560, 563-564</P1>
<P1>Paul Bleiwas and John Hutson, <EM>Taxation of Private Corporations and Their Shareholders</EM>, 4th ed (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 2010), p. 14: 15</P1></P>
<P>69. As described above, the income allocation rules are formulaic. These rules, when applied to Veracity for its federal/BC taxation year ended June 30, 2003, resulted in approximately 10% of its taxable income being allocated to BC. Veracity had a taxable presence in Quebec such that its taxable income not allocated to BC might have been taxed in Quebec. Had Quebec required that Veracity's taxation year for Quebec purposes be the same as it was for federal/BC purposes, approximately 90% of Veracity's taxable income would have been subject to Quebec tax.</P>
<P>70. Veracity's taxable capital gain was subject to limited provincial taxation. This was not a result of any differences between the income allocation rules of BC and Quebec. Those rules were substantially the same. The result arose because the rules applied at different times to different facts due to Veracity's different Quebec taxation year.</P>
<P>71. Veracity agrees with the judge that the purpose of the income allocation rules is to provide a basis for imposing tax liability in the &ldquo;appropriate province&rdquo;. However, Veracity disagrees with the judge's acceptance of the Crown's assertion that the income allocation rules are designed to prevent both the over taxation and the under-taxation of income earned by a corporation which has a taxable presence in more than one province.
<P1>Reasons, AR, p. 47, &para;50</P1></P>
<P>72. On the contrary, it is not the purpose of the income allocation rules to ensure that provincial tax is <UNDER>actually imposed</UNDER> on taxable income allocated to a province. This distinction between allocation and taxation is critical. Whether taxable income allocated to a province is taxed in that province is a matter for each province to determine. This is clear from the statutory scheme of the federal Act of which the income allocation rules are a part and the legislative history of those rules.</P>
<P>73. Under the federal Act, a corporation's tax is reduced by 10% to the extent that it has &ldquo;taxable income earned in a province&rdquo; (that is, in <UNDER>any</UNDER> province). That reduction, called the &ldquo;federal abatement&rdquo; gives the provinces &ldquo;room&rdquo; to levy provincial corporate taxes. The amount of the abatement is the same regardless of the actual provincial tax imposed.
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 123(1), 124(1), Part IV of the Regulations</P1></P>
<P>74. Each province may then impose its own income tax on a corporation's taxable income attributable to a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; in the province. For agreeing provinces, the federal income allocation rules prescribe how a taxpayer's &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in a province&rdquo; is determined. As explained above, non-agreeing provinces, such as Quebec, enact their own rules.</P>
<P>75. The federal income allocation rules have been a feature of the federal Act since before the tax collection agreements. Their function is to give each province &ldquo;room&rdquo; to tax income earned in a province and to ensure that no income is taxed in more than one province. They do not and cannot ensure that a province does in fact levy tax. As the assistant deputy federal Minister of Finance said in 1955:
<QUOTE><P>The objective of the federal rules is to create scope for a provincial tax and let them do what they like.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Roger Letourneau, E.H. Ambrose, J.C. Wilson, and A.K. Eaton, &ldquo;Allocation of Corporate Profits&mdash;Federal-Quebec Overlapping,&rdquo; Report of the Proceedings of the Ninth Tax Conference, 1955 Conference Report (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 1956), 103&ndash;125</P1>
<P1>Smith, p. 562&ndash;564</P1>
<P1>Bleiwas and Hutson, p. 14:12</P1></P>
<P>76. If all provinces were agreeing provinces, there would be <UNDER>no overlap</UNDER> between the provincial tax bases. In the Parliamentary debates at the time the income allocation rules were first adopted, the federal Minister of Finance confirmed:
<QUOTE><P>If these rules for allocating income were adopted by all provinces, there would be eliminated the tendency which prevailed at times in the past for various provincial governments to impose tax, in the aggregate, on more than the total income of corporation carrying on business in several provinces.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Canada, House of Commons, Official Report of Debates (Hansard), 20th Pari, 3rd Sess, Vol 6 (9 July 1947) at 5313 (Hon Douglas Abbott).</P1></P>
<P>77. It is one thing to ensure that the same taxable income is only allocated to one province, and therefore is not taxed by more than one province (ultimately preventing double taxation). It is quite another thing to try to ensure that the income <UNDER>will be taxed</UNDER> by a province. That has not been achieved, and it has not been an objective of the allocation rules or the federal-provincial collection agreements. Gaps in taxation may still exist as a result of different provincial fiscal policies.</P>
<P>78. While agreeing provinces levy tax on the same tax base as Canada, each province will make policy decisions as to whether to provide certain tax incentives or preferences. For example, BC provides preferences using provincial tax credits and tax rebates. Non-agreeing provinces, such as Quebec, make their own fiscal policy decisions regarding the provincial tax base as well as tax incentives and preferences. These provincial fiscal policy choices can result in taxable income which has been allocated to a province being lightly taxed or not taxed at all.</P>
<P>79. The Alberta Court of Appeal in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER> confirmed that where the purpose of a provision is to relieve against double taxation, that does not mean the purpose is to ensure that a minimum level of tax is paid. One issue in those cases was the purpose of the federal Act provision (s. 112(1)) that allows a corporation that receives a taxable dividend to take an equal offsetting deduction, in effect receiving the dividend tax free. The Crown argued that while the purpose of the dividend deduction was to preclude double taxation, the purpose had been frustrated because the income out of which the dividend was paid had not been subject to any provincial taxation. The Alberta Court of Appeal rejected the Crown's argument that the purpose was also to ensure a minimum level of tax, in reliance on the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <UNDER><EM>Antosko</EM></UNDER>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Antosko v. R.</SOC><CITE>[1994] 2 S.C.R. 312</CITE><PAGENUM>pp. 331-332</PAGENUM></CASEREF></P1>

<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER>, &para;43&ndash;51</P1></P>
<P>80. The purpose of the federal/BC income allocation rules is to prevent overlapping allocation which would lead to double taxation. The Crown in this case seeks to engraft an additional purpose onto the rules&mdash;that the result arising under those rules should not be respected where taxable income allocated under those rules is exempt from provincial taxation.</P>
<P>81. A similar attempt to engraft an additional purpose onto a provision was made by the Crown in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER>. The Crown argued under the Alberta GAAR that the provision of the federal Act (s. 20(1)(c)) that was relied on by the taxpayers to support an interest deduction had been frustrated because the corresponding receipt of interest was not taxed in Ontario. The Court rejected this argument:
<QUOTE><P>Had Alberta intended the purpose of its counterpart provision to section 20(1)(c) to depend on the circumstances of other taxpayers (the lenders), it could have used language denying an interest deduction when the lender's interest income was not taxable.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER>, &para;45</P1></P>
<P>82. The Crown's theory of the purpose of the federal/BC income allocation rules is not supported by their text, their context or their legislative history. To the contrary, the federal/BC income allocation rules applied to Veracity as intended. Taxable income was allocated in accordance with Veracity's taxable presence in BC and Quebec. Taxable income allocable to Quebec under the federal income allocation rules (and not allocated to BC) was not subject to Quebec tax because Quebec permitted Veracity to choose a different taxation year for Quebec purposes, not because there was any abuse of the income allocation rules. Veracity satisfied the object, spirit and purpose of the income allocation rules.</P>
<P>83. If Quebec had required Veracity to have the same taxation year for Quebec purposes as for federal/BC purposes, Veracity's taxable income that was allocable to Quebec under the federal rules would have been subject to Quebec tax. There can be no misuse or abuse of the BC income allocation rules that turns on whether taxable income not allocated to BC is taxed in another province. The appellate court decisions in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>MIL</EM></UNDER> all confirm that the application of a GAAR does not depend on whether income not taxed in the jurisdiction covered by that GAAR is taxed somewhere else.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>Section 85 and the rules for calculating taxable income have not been abused</UNDER></TI>
<P>84. The judge erred in accepting the Crown's submission that the federal Act provisions relevant in determining taxable income (s. 3, 38, 39 and 40 and s. 85) were misused or abused. The judge made several errors in arriving at this conclusion.</P>
<P>85. These provisions are not subject to the BC GAAR because they are not provisions of the BC Act and are not incorporated by reference into the BC Act.
<P1>See Leah Plumridge and Daniel Sandler, &ldquo;Quebec &ldquo;year-end shuffle&rdquo; subject to BC GAAR: <CASEREF><SOC>Veracity Capital Corporation v. Canada (National Revenue)</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 2278</CITE></CASEREF>&rdquo; EY Commentary 2016-001, January 14, 2016</P1></P>
<P>86. Each of these provisions was relevant only in so far as they were elements in the determination of Veracity's taxable income under the federal Act. When BC agreed under the BC Tax Collection Agreement to levy tax on its allocated share of taxable income as determined under the federal Act, BC agreed to accept the federal determination of taxable income. The BC GAAR cannot be applied to alter this determination, or any of its statutory elements.
<P1>Janette Pantry, &ldquo;The Role of the Provincial General Anti-Avoidance Rules in Interprovincial Taxation,&rdquo; 2013 Conference Report, (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 2014), 36: 13-14</P1></P>
<P>87. In any event, the Crown has never alleged that Veracity's capital gain or its taxable income was incorrectly determined. The fact that Veracity did not pay provincial tax on a certain portion of its taxable income had nothing to do with s. 85 of the federal Act, or the calculation of Veracity's capital gain under the federal Act. If no s. 85 election had been made, Veracity's cost of the ALI shares would have been their fair market value as of the date on which Veracity acquired them, and Veracity would have had little or no capital gain when it later sold the ALI shares. There was no &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo; to Veracity from the s. 85 elections or the federal Act provisions under which Veracity's capital gain was determined. Therefore there could be no abuse of those provisions.</P>
<P>88. The judge also erred in finding that s. 85 was &ldquo;intended only to preserve and defer tax&rdquo;. The purpose of s. 85 is to allow a taxpayer to defer the recognition of a gain on the disposition of property, so that the deferred gain may be realized by the transferee upon a subsequent disposition of the property. Nothing in s. 85 ensures or is intended to ensure that the deferred gain is taxed at some later time, or at any time. Any number of intervening events, planned or unplanned, could preclude that result. For example, the deferred gain might be reduced if values shift or, even if the full deferred gain is realized, it may be sheltered by losses or an exemption. In this case, s. 85 worked exactly as it was intended to work. The capital gain that would have been realized by Mr. Peet and Pi Capital if no s. 85 election had been made was deferred, and the entire deferred gain was realized by Veracity on the sale of the ALI shares.
<P1>Reasons, AR, p. 48, &para;53.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Evans v. R.</SOC><CITE>2005 TCC 684</CITE><PARANUM>27&ndash;29</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>89. The judge's incorrect determination of the purpose of s. 85 led him to err further in relying on <UNDER><EM>OGT</EM></UNDER>, a case of doubtful authority (see para 52 above) that in any event is distinguishable on its facts. In <UNDER><EM>OGT</EM></UNDER>, a Quebec corporate taxpayer transferred shares to an Ontario corporate taxpayer in exchange for shares. An election was made under s. 518 of the Quebec Act (the analogue to s. 85) to defer the capital gain for Quebec purposes that would otherwise be realized. No &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; election was made under s. 85 of the federal Act and the Quebec taxpayer realized a capital gain for federal purposes. At that time, it was possible to make a Quebec &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; election that differed from the federal election although the Quebec Act has since been amended.</P>
<P>90. When the Ontario corporate taxpayer sold the shares, it realized no capital gain for federal purposes but it also realized no capital gain for Ontario purposes because the applicable Ontario rule was harmonized with the federal rule. Thus the capital gain that was deferred for Quebec purposes was never realized for any provincial purpose and was not subject to provincial tax.</P>
<P>91. The Quebec Court of Appeal found this to be an abuse of s. 518 of the Quebec Act. The taxpayer had used a Quebec &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; provision to avoid Quebec tax. The remedy under the Quebec GAAR was to deny the effect of the Quebec election. In effect, the Quebec GAAR applied to eliminate the taxpayer's ability to access a Quebec difference.</P>
<P>92. Unlike <UNDER><EM>OGT</EM></UNDER>, Veracity did not use a BC &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; provision that differed from a federal &ldquo;rollover&rdquo; provision because no such BC difference exists. The result of the federal s. 85 elections in this case was the same federally and provincially. Accordingly, <UNDER><EM>OGT</EM></UNDER> has no application in this case.</P>
<P>93. The sections of the federal Act relevant in determining Veracity's taxable income did not give rise to the provincial tax benefit at issue, are not subject to the BC GAAR and, in any event, operated exactly as they were supposed to. For all these reasons, the judge erred in finding that there was abuse of these provisions under the BC GAAR.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Conclusion</UNDER></TI>
<P>94. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly stated that any allegation of abusive tax avoidance must be grounded in the textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the relevant statutory provisions, it cannot be based on a tax policy not found in the relevant legislation.</P>
<P>95. Here, the judge's conclusion was based on his unfounded assumption that all of Veracity's income &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to have been subject to provincial tax &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;. This premise is not found in the provisions of the BC Act or any other provincial statute and is impugned by concepts of provincial sovereignty. Each province has the right to set its own tax policy. The natural and foreseeable result of those provincial choices is the potential for gaps between the tax nets of the provinces.</P>
<P>96. Veracity took advantage of the Quebec difference. Provisions of the Quebec Act are not subject to the BC GAAR and Veracity's choice was not abusive of the BC Act. As the appellate courts of Ontario and Alberta found in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER>, taking advantage of favourable tax treatment in another province is not abusive.</P>
<P>97. Quebec responded to the perceived abuse in this case by eliminating the ability to choose a different tax year end for Quebec purposes. That was a legislative remedy within the jurisdiction of the Quebec legislature. It is not the function of the BC GAAR.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>The appellant Veracity is a B.C. corporation incorporated by a B.C. resident individual as part of the Q-Yes plan, a tax plan intended to avoid B.C. income tax that would have been payable in respect of a $19.4 million capital gain realized on a share sale. The Q-Yes plan avoided B.C. tax by engineering an allocation of taxable income to Quebec for B.C. tax purposes. The plan resulted in a 90% reduction of the B.C. tax that would ordinarily have been payable.</P>
<P>The B.C. <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 215 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;B.C. Act&rdquo;)</BOLD> levies provincial income tax on corporations that maintain a permanent establishment in B.C. at any time during a taxation year. Tax is paid on the corporation's taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia, an amount determined under an allocation formula found in the federal <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.) (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Federal Act&rdquo;)</BOLD> and <EM>Income Tax Regulations</EM>, C.R.C., c. 945 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Federal Regulations&rdquo;).</BOLD> Those provisions are intended to prevent both the over-taxation and the under-taxation of income earned by a corporation with a presence in more than one province in a year.</P>
<P>Section 68.1 of the B.C. Act (the <BOLD>&ldquo;BC GAAR&rdquo;)</BOLD> provides that where a tax benefit results from one or more avoidance transactions, the tax consequences to a taxpayer must be determined so as to deny the tax benefit that results from those avoidance transactions. The trial judge found that the Q-Yes plan contained at least four avoidance transactions, undertaken primarily to avoid B.C. tax and which resulted in an abuse of the provisions of the B.C. Act by permitting Veracity to avoid $1,175 million of B.C. tax on $8.7 million of its taxable income.</P>
<P>In finding abusive tax avoidance, the trial judge identified the object and spirit of the provisions that Veracity relied on to obtain that tax benefit. He found that the avoidance transactions were inconsistent with that object and spirit and that the abuse of those provisions is clear. He made no error in doing so.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The facts as stated by the appellant are substantially accurate but are incomplete for purposes of this appeal. The respondent relies on the facts as stated below.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>The ALI Technologies Takeover</TI>
<P>2. ALI was incorporated on April 11, 1988. It grew into a leading vendor of picture archiving and communications systems for the digital management of radiological images. In 1993, Greg Peet was recruited to become ALI's CEO.
<P1>Reasons for Judgment of Macintosh J. (&ldquo;Reasons&rdquo;), paras. 9-10 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 32)</P1>
<P1>Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (&ldquo;PASF&rdquo;), paras. 1&ndash;15 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>3. ALI attracted the attention of McKesson Corporation. On May 1, 2002, McKesson informed ALI that it was prepared to make a formal takeover bid subject to the execution of a support agreement with ALI and of lock-up agreements with ALI's principal shareholders. On that day, McKesson and 646543 BC entered into a support agreement with ALI and into lock-up agreements with ALI's principal shareholders, including Peet. The lock-up agreement unconditionally and irrevocably committed Peet to accept 646543 BC's offer.
<P1>Reasons, para. 10 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 32)</P1>
<P1>PASF, paras. 21&ndash;25 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>4. As of May 1, 2002, Peet and his family, directly and through his holding company Pi Capital, held 714,207 common shares of ALI. Peet held 428,907 ALI shares directly outside his RRSP (and not in trust for any other person), and Pi Capital held 110,600. Peet held a further 218,400 ALI options.
<P1>Reasons, para. 11 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 33)</P1>
<P1>PASF, paras. 26-27 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>5. On May 30, 2002, 646543 BC issued its takeover bid for all outstanding ALI shares.
<P1>Reasons, para. 10 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 32)</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Q-Yes Plan</TI>
<P>6. Anticipating a significant capital gain from the sale of his ALI shares, Peet approached KPMG for tax planning advice. KPMG provided Peet with eight possible tax saving strategies including the Q-Yes plan. KPMG divided the strategies into categories labelled &ldquo;standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; and attached a risk assessment to each strategy. It labelled the Q-Yes plan as an innovative strategy presenting a moderate risk.
<P1>Reasons, paras. 13 and 18 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 33-34)</P1></P>
<P>7. In an engagement letter issued June 6, 2002, KPMG confirmed Peet's instructions to proceed with the Q-Yes plan. In the engagement letter, KPMG committed to provide comments and suggested steps to effect the tax plan, including by determining the appropriate year ends and necessary investments, by preparing a detailed instruction letter outlining the necessary steps and transactions to implement the plan, and by generally managing the implementation of the transactions.
<P1>Reasons, para. 15 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 33)</P1></P>
<P>8. KPMG's fee for preparing and implementing the Q-Yes plan was $110,000. The fee was contingent and was subject to reduction to as little as $40,000 if a tax authority successfully challenged the plan.
<P1>Reasons, para. 16 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 33-34)</P1></P>
<P>9. The following transactions were undertaken pursuant to KPMG's plan:
<P1>1. <UNDER>Incorporation of Veracity</UNDER>
<P2>a. Veracity was incorporated on June 10, 2002. Veracity was incorporated because the Q-Yes tax benefit is available only to a corporation, and because the plan required a corporation without preexisting income or expenses that would be malleable for provincial income allocation purposes.
<P3>Testimony of Greg Peet (&ldquo;Peet Testimony&rdquo;), Transcript of proceedings, p. 83 line 37 to p. 84 line 47 (Joint Appeal Book)</P3></P2>
<P2>b. Veracity selected a June 30 fiscal period end for federal and B.C. tax purposes. Its first B.C. taxation year ran from June 10 to 30, 2002.</P2>
<P2>c. Veracity selected a June 30 federal/B.C. fiscal period end to defer reporting the Taxable Gain by a calendar year so that the Taxable Gain would not be reported in B.C. until after Gaz Metro had allocated revenues and salaries that would cause Veracity's taxable income to be allocated to Quebec.
<P3>Peet Testimony, p. 95 lines 26&ndash;47 and p. 96 lines 1&ndash;14 (Joint Appeal Book)</P3></P2>
<P2>d. Peet and his spouse were appointed Veracity's directors.</P2></P1>
<P1>2. <UNDER>Transfer of ALI shares to Veracity</UNDER>
<P2>a. On June 14, 2002, Peet and Pi Capital transferred to Veracity 539,507 ALI shares, representing all of the ALI shares that Peet &ldquo;freely&rdquo; held.</P2>
<P2>b. Veracity, Peet, and Pi Capital elected to transfer the ALI shares on a tax-deferred basis pursuant to s. 85 of the Federal Act. The shares were transferred at their adjusted cost base.</P2></P1>
<P1>3. <UNDER>Veracity sold the ALI shares</UNDER>
<P2>a. Subsequently, Veracity accepted 646543 BC's offer to purchase the ALI shares. On July 11, 2002 Veracity received cash proceeds of $24,468,554.50 for the ALI shares.</P2></P1>
<P1>4. <UNDER>Veracity paid director's fees in B.C.</UNDER>
<P2>a. On July 11, 2002, Veracity paid $1,000 each to Peet and his spouse as director's fees. This was done to ensure that when income was reported in Quebec 100% of the income would be allocated to B.C.
<P3>Peet Testimony, p. 108 lines 19&ndash;32 (Joint Appeal Book)</P3></P2>
<P2>b. Veracity then immediately transferred the remaining $23,466,554.60 from its bank account to Pi Capital, recording the transfer as an interest-free demand loan. This was done to ensure that Veracity did not earn interest income in B.C. that would increase the allocation of taxable income to B.C. for the B.C. taxation year ending June 30, 2003.
<P3>Peet Testimony p. 89 line 38 to p. 90 line 14 (Joint Appeal Book)</P3></P2></P1>
<P1>5. <UNDER>Veracity purchased units of Gaz Metro</UNDER>
<P2>a. Between July 22 and 29, 2002, Veracity purchased 15,000 units of Gaz Metro for $266,337.</P2>
<P2>b. Gaz Metro was a publicly-traded limited partnership with a permanent establishment in Quebec. Gaz Metro was a regulated natural gas utility carrying on business in Quebec.</P2>
<P2>c. Gaz Metro had a September 30 year-end and was expected to allocate proportionate shares of gross revenues, salaries, and wages to Veracity at that year-end.</P2>
<P2>d. The purchase of Gaz Metro units resulted in Veracity having a permanent establishment in Quebec for purposes of the Federal Act and the Federal Regulations. The purchase also resulted in Veracity maintaining an &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; in Quebec under the Quebec <EM>Taxation Act</EM>, C.Q.L.R. c. I-3 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Quebec Act&rdquo;</BOLD>). Accordingly, Veracity became liable to Quebec income tax.</P2>
<P2>e. Veracity purchased the Gaz Metro units because KPMG advised it to do so as a critically-important ingredient of the Q-Yes plan. Mr. Peet was not aware of Gaz Metro as a potential investment apart from it being used as a key step in the Q-Yes plan.</P2>
<P2>f. Acquiring units of Gaz Metro provided Veracity with a means to allocate taxable income (including the Taxable Gain) to Quebec for B.C. tax purposes, thus avoiding B.C. tax otherwise payable.</P2>
<P2>g. Gaz Metro was carefully chosen because (a) it was a partnership rather than a corporation, and would give rise to a permanent establishment in Quebec; (b) its year-end fell between Veracity's Quebec and B.C. fiscal year-ends; and (c) it offered security and liquidity and minimized the commercial risk associated with obtaining the tax benefit.
<P3>Peet Testimony, p. 116, lines 8&ndash;25, p. 118 line 20 to p. 119 line 25.</P3></P2></P1>
<P1>6. <UNDER>Veracity selected different fiscal periods for Quebec and B.C. tax purposes</UNDER>
<P2>a. Veracity selected an August 31 fiscal year end for Quebec income tax purposes. Its first taxation year for Quebec income tax purposes ran from June 14 to August 31, 2002.</P2>
<P2>b. Selecting different fiscal period ends in B.C. and Quebec enabled Veracity to obtain the benefit of avoiding B.C. tax without being liable for Quebec tax on that same income. Veracity reported the Taxable Gain in Quebec at a time when it would not have any Quebec tax liability because Gaz Metro had not yet allocated any revenues or wages.</P2>
<P2>c. Veracity could not have obtained the benefit of avoiding B.C. tax without incurring a corresponding Quebec tax liability if it had chosen the same fiscal period in both provinces. With a common fiscal period, Veracity would have been taxed on 100% of the Taxable Gain in one province or the other:
<P3>i. If June 30 was the common fiscal period end, then the Taxable Gain would have been reported as of June 30, 2003 in both provinces, the Quebec allocation formula would have allocated 89.8% of its taxable income to Quebec, and the federal formula would have allocated 10.2% to B.C.</P3>
<P3>ii. If August 31 was the common fiscal period end, then the Taxable Gain would have been reported as of August 31, 2002 in both provinces and the federal allocation formula would have allocated 100% to B.C.</P3></P2></P1>
<P1>7. <UNDER>Veracity acquired additional units in Gaz Metro</UNDER>
<P2>a. From September 10 to 13, 2002, Veracity acquired an additional 30,000 units of Gaz Metro for $547,422. By September 13, 2002, Veracity held 45,000 Gaz Metro units with a total cost of $813,759.</P2>
<P2>b. The primary purpose for acquiring additional Gaz Metro units in September 2002 was to further avoid B.C. tax under the Q-Yes plan. In August 2002, Peet learned that Veracity had not invested as much in Gaz Metro as KPMG had expected. KPMG provided him with worksheets showing that the B.C. tax could be reduced by a further $150,000 through increasing the Gaz Metro investment to $800,000. A $150,000 reduction in B.C. tax equated to an immediate 27.4% return on the additional Gaz Metro investment of $547,422.</P2>
<P2>c. Acquiring 45,000 Gaz Metro units permitted Veracity to avoid $1,175,249 of B.C. tax with minimal investment risk. That saving equates to a 150% one-year return on the $813,759 investment. By contrast, the Gaz Metro units generated $241,000 of income over four years, representing a cumulative return of 29.6% and an average annual return of 7.6%. The immediate tax benefit of the investment outweighed the investment return by five-to-one.</P2>
<P2>d. Veracity bought all of the Gaz Metro units primarily in order to maximize the tax reduction under the Q-Yes plan.</P2>
<P2>Reasons, paras. 19 and 21&ndash;26 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 34&ndash;36 and 37-38)</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Veracity's Tax Reporting in B.C. and Quebec</TI>
<P>10. On disposing of the ALI shares to 646543 BC, Veracity realized a capital gain of $19,419,982 of which 50%, being $9,709,991, is the Taxable Gain.
<P1>PASF, paras. 33&ndash;36 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>11. In its federal/B.C. income tax return for the taxation year ending June 30, 2002, Veracity reported no income, as it had not disposed of the ALI shares by that date.
<P1>PASF, para. 37 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>12. In its Quebec income tax return for the year ending August 31, 2002, Veracity reported taxable income of $9,686,591, including the Taxable Gain. Veracity reported that 100% of its business was carried on in B.C. because 100% of the wages and salaries paid in that period (the director's fees) were paid in B.C. and it had no gross revenues. As a result, Veracity owed no Quebec income tax.
<P1>PASF, paras. 38&ndash;40 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>13. In its federal/B.C. income tax return for the taxation year ending June 30, 2003, Veracity reported taxable income of $9,698,646, including the Taxable Gain. Veracity allocated $8,705,551 (89.8%) of that taxable income to Quebec and $993,095 (10.2%) to B.C. Veracity paid $134,068 of B.C. income tax.
<P1>PASF, paras. 41&ndash;43 (Joint Appeal Book)</P1></P>
<P>14. In the result, Veracity paid provincial income tax on only $993,095 of the Taxable Gain. $8,705,551 was neither reported as taxable nor taxed in any province.
<P1>Reasons, para. 20 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 36-37)</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The reassessment and the appeal</TI>
<P>15. The Minister of National Revenue (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Minister&rdquo;)</BOLD> applied the BC GAAR to allocate 100% of Veracity's taxable income in the taxation year ending June 30, 2003 to B.C. The Minister increased Veracity's taxable income earned in that year in British Columbia by $8,705,551 (the amount previously allocated to Quebec) and assessed additional B.C. income tax of $1,175,249.</P>
<P>16. The appellant appealed the assessment to the Supreme Court under s. 42 of the BC Act. The trial judge dismissed the appeal.</P>
<P>17. The trial judge based his decision on the following findings of fact:
<P1>a. The reason for Veracity employing the Q-Yes plan was to avoid income tax that would otherwise have been paid in B.C.
<P2>Reasons, para. 20 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 36-37)</P2></P1>
<P1>b. Veracity obtained a B.C. tax benefit from the Q-Yes Plan. That tax benefit was avoiding $1,175,249 of B.C. income tax that would have been payable on its taxable income of $9,698,646 in the 2003 taxation year had it not undertaken the Q-Yes Plan.
<P2>Reasons, paras. 28 and 33&ndash;35 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 39&ndash;41)</P2></P1>
<P1>c. The Q-Yes plan comprised a &ldquo;series of transactions&rdquo; at common law. The transactions were undertaken pursuant to a detailed instruction letter prepared by KPMG and they operated together to produce the tax benefit.
<P2>Reasons, para. 39 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp. 42&ndash;45)</P2></P1>
<P1>d. The series contained at least four avoidance transactions: (1) the incorporation of Veracity; (2) the transfer of ALI shares to Veracity by Peet and Pi Capital; (3) the acquisition of units in Gaz Metro; and (4) the selection and filing on the basis of different fiscal periods for federal/B.C. tax purposes on one hand and for Quebec purposes on the other.
<P2>Reasons, para. 40 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 45)</P2></P1>
<P1>e. The primary purpose for each of those four transactions was to obtain the benefit of avoiding B.C. income tax.
<P2>Reasons, paras. 41&ndash;45 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 45)</P2></P1>
<P1>f. Each transaction except for the ALI share sale and the Gaz Metro revenue and wages allocation was probably an avoidance transaction, although it was not necessary to extend the analysis beyond the four identified above.
<P2>Reasons, para. 46 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p.46)</P2></P1></P>
<P>18. The trial judge rejected the appellant's attempts to justify the purchase of Gaz Metro units as primarily investment-driven.
<P1>Reasons, paras. 21&ndash;27 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp.37&ndash;38)</P1></P>
<P>19. In determining that the avoidance transactions resulted in a misuse or abuse of the provisions of the B.C. Act, the trial judge held that:
<P1>a. Abusive tax avoidance results when: (1) the transaction achieves an outcome the statutory provision was intended to prevent; (2) the transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provision; or (3) the transaction circumvents the provision in a manner that frustrates or defeats its object, spirit or, purpose. Having regard to those three criteria, the Q-Yes plan implemented by Veracity resulted in abusive tax avoidance.
<P2>Reasons, paras. 47&ndash;49 (Appeal Record Tab 4, pp.46&ndash;47)</P2></P1>
<P1>b. The relevant legislation includes provisions of the B.C. Act establishing the basis for Veracity's liability to B.C. tax as well as provisions of the Federal Act and Regulations incorporated into or adopted by the B.C. Act for computing tax liability under the B.C. Act. The legislative scheme intends that capital gains earned in Canada by corporations be taxed as income by the provinces based on an allocation formula designed to prevent both the over-taxation and the under-taxation of corporate income earned in multiple provinces.
<P2>Reasons, para. 50 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 47)</P2></P1>
<P1>c. The Q-Yes plan abused s. 85 of the Federal Act because that provision is a rollover provision intended to preserve and defer tax and the Q-Yes plan used it to avoid the tax completely. Section 85 was used to put the ALI shares, and the related gain, in the hands of a taxpayer who could then avoid B.C. tax completely on 90% of the taxable gain. Using a tax deferral provision in that way was not within the object and spirit of the provision.
<P2>Reasons, paras. 53-54 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 48)</P2></P1>
<P1>d. The Q-Yes plan abused the B.C. and Federal Act provisions for determining income, taxable income and taxable income earned in a year in British Columbia. The plan computed a taxable capital gain which was to be included in income but which was not taxed notwithstanding an intention in both Acts that taxable capital gains be subject to taxation like ordinary income. Transactions resulting in capital gains which avoid tax completely frustrate the legislation.
<P2>Reasons, para. 55 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 48)</P2></P1>
<P1>e. The Q-Yes plan abused the legislative provisions related to the allocation of taxable income between provinces. The allocation formula is not intended to enable a taxpayer to avoid tax. It is intended to provide a basis for imposing tax liability in the appropriate province. Veracity obtained an establishment in Quebec for the purpose of avoiding B.C. tax when it knew it would never pay tax in Quebec. That circumvented the object and spirit of those provisions.
<P2>Reasons, para. 56 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 48)</P2></P1>
<P1>f. Veracity adopted contradictory positions about the allocation of the same income, maintaining in B.C. that 90% of its taxable income was taxable in Quebec while maintaining in Quebec that 100% of the same income was taxable in B.C. This was a clear abuse of the income allocation provisions.
<P2>Reasons, para. 56 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 48)</P2></P1>
<P1>g. The Q-Yes plan abused the legislative provisions for taxation years and fiscal year ends. Although the legislation permitted a corporation to select one fiscal period in Quebec and another for federal and B.C. tax purposes, the legislation did not contemplate a taxpayer using different fiscal periods in different jurisdictions for the same income in the same year. No legislation contemplated the Q-Yes plan's shuffle between jurisdictions.
<P2>Reasons, para. 57 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 49)</P2></P1></P>
<P>20. The trial judge distinguished this case from the case of a taxpayer selecting a &ldquo;tax haven&rdquo; country or province as a place for doing business in order to reduce tax. Veracity did not take advantage of a Quebec legislative policy intended to provide a &ldquo;tax holiday&rdquo; for Veracity's income through the Quebec provisions for fiscal periods and taxation years. The Q-Yes plan merely exploited a legislative loophole.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ISSUES ON APPEAL</TI>
<P>21. The trial judge did not err by finding that the Q-Yes plan resulted in abusive tax avoidance. Specifically:
<P1>a. The trial judge applied the GAAR jurisprudence correctly;</P1>
<P1>b. The trial judge did not apply the B.C. GAAR to override an explicit legislative policy choice made by Quebec;</P1>
<P1>c. The trial judge did not consider provisions that are outside the scope of the BC GAAR; and</P1>
<P1>d. The trial judge correctly determined the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant statutory provisions upon which Veracity relied to obtain a tax benefit.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The BC GAAR framework</TI>
<P>22. The principle that taxpayers may order their affairs so as to minimize tax payable (the <EM>Duke of Westminster</EM> principle) has never been absolute. The principle is subject to various common law and legislative limits. A legislative GAAR provides a further statutory basis for denying the benefits of abusive tax planning and attempts to provide preserve certainty for taxpayers in their planning.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Lipson v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 1</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>23. The BC GAAR lays down the conditions when tax benefits that would otherwise be available under the B.C. Act will be denied: :
<QUOTE><SEC><N>68.1</N><SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>If a transaction is an avoidance transaction, the tax consequences to a person must be determined in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny a tax benefit that, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, from that transaction or from a series of transactions that includes that transaction.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE>
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 68.1(2)</P1></P>
<P>24. The key concepts in ss. 68.1(2) are &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo;, &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo;, and &ldquo;tax consequences&rdquo;. Generally, the BC GAAR will apply to deny a tax benefit when that benefit results from an avoidance transaction, and it does so by requiring that the tax position of any person be re-determined in order to deny the tax benefit.</P>
<P>25. A tax benefit is a reduction, avoidance, or deferral of tax or another amount payable, or an increase in a refund of tax or another amount, under the B.C. Act. The BC GAAR may apply whenever a transaction, or a series of transactions, results in a tax benefit.
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 68.1(1) definition of &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>26. &ldquo;Avoidance transaction&rdquo; is the central concept in the BC GAAR because a tax benefit will be denied only when it results from an avoidance transaction, or from a series of transactions that includes an avoidance transaction. A transaction is an &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo; when:
<P1>a. The transaction results, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit or is part of a series of transactions that results, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit;</P1>
<P1>b. The transaction may not reasonably be considered to have been undertaken primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes. Obtaining a B.C. tax benefit, and avoiding tax or increasing a refund of tax under any other federal or provincial Act, are not <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes; and</P1>
<P1>c. The transaction may not reasonably be considered not to result in a misuse of a provision of the B.C. Act or in an abuse having regard to those provisions read as a whole.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The BC GAAR differs from the federal GAAR in s. 245 of the Federal Act in that it combines the misuse/abuse analysis with the meaning of avoidance transaction. Under the federal GAAR, the misuse/abuse analysis is discrete from the avoidance transaction analysis (compare ss. 245(3) and (4) of the Federal Act), such that a transaction may be an avoidance transaction but still not be subject to the GAAR.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>27. When a transaction meets those three criteria, the BC GAAR applies and the resulting tax benefit must be denied. The tax benefit is denied by determining the &ldquo;tax consequences&rdquo; to a person in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances. Tax consequences includes a person's income, taxable income, and taxable income earned in a year in British Columbia.
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 68.1(1) definition of &ldquo;tax consequences&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>28. In determining reasonable tax consequences in order to deny a tax benefit, the BC GAAR gives the Minister and the Court the authority make a range of adjustments notwithstanding the actual facts (such as recharacterizing the nature of payments) or the normal operation of the statute (such as by ignoring the tax effects that would otherwise result from statutory provisions).
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 68.1(3)</P1></P>
<P>29. In its federal GAAR jurisprudence, the Supreme Court of Canada has condensed the GAAR analysis into the following three steps, which should apply equally to the BC GAAR:
<P1>a. Was there a tax benefit?</P1>
<P1>b. Was the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit an avoidance transaction?</P1>
<P1>c. Was the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit abusive?

<P>30. The trial judge found that Veracity enjoyed a tax benefit and that the tax benefit resulted from at least four avoidance transactions that were part of the Q-Yes plan. On this appeal, the only issue is whether the Q-Yes plan results in an abuse.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The applicable standard of review</TI>
<P>31. Determining whether an avoidance transaction results in an abuse is a two-part inquiry. The first step is to determine the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislative provisions that are relied on for the tax benefit. This interpretive exercise is to be conducted using a textual, contextual, and purposive approach. The second step is to determine whether, in the factual context of the case, the avoidance transactions defeated or frustrated the object, spirit, and purpose of the provisions.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at paras. 44 and 55</P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne Holdings</EM></UNDER> at paras. 69&ndash;71</P1></P>
<P>32. The overall inquiry involves a mixed question of fact and law. The textual, contextual, and purposive interpretation of specific provisions of the taxing statute is essentially a question of law, but the application of those provisions to the facts of a case is necessarily fact-intensive, and whether an abuse results is a question of fact.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at paras. 44 and 46</P1></P>
<P>33. A trial judge's interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions relied on by a taxpayer to claim a tax benefit is reviewable on a correctness standard. By contrast, if the judge has properly interpreted the relevant statutory provisions, his determination of abuse should not be overturned absent a palpable and overriding error.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at para. 46</P1></P>
<P>34. In this case, the trial judge correctly followed the two-step approach outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada. His reasons disclose that he identified the object, spirit, and purpose of the relevant legislative provisions giving rise to the tax benefit, and he based his determination of abuse on whether that tax benefit was within or outside that object, spirit and purpose. There is no reason for this Court to interfere.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge appreciated the hallmarks of abusive tax avoidance</TI>
<P>35. The trial judge appreciated the hallmarks of abusive tax avoidance. He followed the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada and determined that the indicators of abuse are present. He did not misdirect himself.</P>
<P>36. The trial judge recognized, as laid out in the Supreme Court of Canada's GAAR jurisprudence, that not all tax planning (and therefore not every tax benefit) is abusive. The purpose of the GAAR is to draw a line between legitimate tax reduction and abusive tax avoidance.
<P1>Reasons, para. 2 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 31)</P1></P>
<P>37. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that abusive tax avoidance will usually result in three scenarios:
<P1>a. When a taxpayer relies on specific statutory provisions in order to achieve an outcome that those provisions seek to prevent;</P1>
<P1>b. When a transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions that are relied on; and</P1>
<P1>c. When the transaction circumvents the application of certain provisions in a manner that frustrates or defeats the object, spirit, or purpose of the provisions.
<P2><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at para. 45</P2>
<P2><UNDER><EM>Copthorne Holdings</EM></UNDER> at para. 72</P2></P1></P>
<P>38. Vacuous and artificial transactions are more likely to be abusive than substantive transactions with a basis in commercial reality. The vacuous and artificial nature of transactions may confirm their abusive nature.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Mathew v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 55</CITE><PARANUM>62</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Global Equity Fund Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2012 FCA 272</CITE><PARANUM>67</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>39. The inquiry asks not whether an avoidance transaction, standing alone, complies with the legislation. It focuses on the <UNDER>overall result</UNDER> of the avoidance transaction. The question is whether the tax benefit resulting from the avoidance transaction is intended by the legislation: whether it accords with the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislation, or defeats and frustrates the legislative scheme.</P>
<P>40. When an avoidance transaction forms part of a series of transactions, the abuse analysis is not narrowly focused on the avoidance transaction itself but should consider the transaction in the context of the series as a whole. A transaction that is not abusive when viewed in isolation may yet be abusive when it forms part of a series that leads to a tax benefit that is not within the object and spirit of the legislative provisions. Whether a particular transaction results in an abuse should be considered in the context of the series and its overall result.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Copthorne Holdings</EM></UNDER> at para. 72</P1>
<P1><UNDER><EM>Lipson</EM></UNDER> at para. 40</P1></P>
<P>41. The considerations mentioned in <EM>Canada Trustco</EM> and <EM>Copthorne Holdings</EM> are not independent of one another and may overlap. The overarching question is whether a tax benefit frustrates or defeats the object, spirit, or purpose of the provisions that confer it. Abuse is generally not established where it is reasonable to conclude that an avoidance transaction was within the object, spirit, or purpose of the provisions.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at paras. 45 and 49</P1></P>
<P>42. A GAAR is often referred to as a provision &ldquo;of last resort&rdquo;. It applies when a transaction otherwise complies with the text of the relevant provisions. Its purpose is to ensure that tax benefits accord with the object and spirit, not just the text, of those provisions. A GAAR is not, however, an exceptional provision and the Supreme Court of Canada has not described it as such. Rather, the Supreme Court held that a GAAR should be given its proper effect as a statutory provision like any other.
<P1><UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER> at paras. 13 and 51</P1></P>
<P>43. Although the GAAR should not be interpreted as imposing the responsibility for formulating tax policy on the courts, it does require the courts to ensure that tax benefits enjoyed by taxpayers accord with the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislation. Where taxpayers obtain benefits that are anomalous having regard to the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislation, the GAAR will deny them.</P>
<P>44. Even if a tax benefit results from a &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; in the legislation, the GAAR will deny that benefit if the benefit is anomalous having regard to the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislation. Denying that tax benefit does not amount to filling a legislative gap or loophole. Instead, it is an exercise in protecting the object, spirit, and purpose of the legislation from manipulation and abuse.

<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge examined the correct provisions</TI>
<P>45. The trial judge correctly concluded that the relevant statutory provisions include both the provisions of the B.C. Act that establish the basis of Veracity's liability to B.C. tax, and those provisions of the Federal Act and Regulations incorporated into, or adopted by, the B.C. Act for computing tax liability. The relevant federal provisions include those for computing taxable capital gains, income, and taxable income, as well as those dealing with taxation years and fiscal periods.</P>
<P>46. Subsection 2(2) of the B.C. Act bases liability for corporate income tax on the presence of a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; in B.C. in a year. The tax payable itself is based on a corporation's &ldquo;taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia&rdquo;. &ldquo;Taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia&rdquo; is defined in s. 13.3 of the B.C. Act as the taxable income earned in the year in British Columbia as determined &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo; regulations made under subsection 124(4) of the Federal Act.
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 2(2), 13.3 and 14</P1></P>
<P>47. Subsection 124(4) of the Federal Act and Part IV of the Federal Regulations are the provisions that address computing a corporation's taxable income earned in a year in a particular province. Subsection 124(4) of the Federal Act provides that federal tax otherwise payable in respect of a corporation's taxable income is reduced by 10% of the amount of that income that was earned in a province. The 10% reduction provides provinces with taxing room for provincial corporate income tax.
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 124(4)</P1></P>
<P>48. Part IV of the Federal Regulations addresses computing a corporation's taxable income earned in a year in a province. The key to the computation is the presence of a permanent establishment in one or more provinces. Taxable income is allocated only to provinces in which a corporation has a permanent establishment in a year. When a corporation has a permanent establishment in multiple provinces, then its taxable income is allocated to those particular provinces using the ratio-based formula in Regulation 400.
<P1>Federal Regulations, Part IV</P1></P>
<P>49. The allocation formula in Part IV of the Federal Regulations applies to a corporation's &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo;. Subsection 2(2) of the Federal Act defines taxable income as a taxpayer's income for the year plus and minus certain additions and deductions. Section 3 of the Federal Act defines a taxpayer's income as including taxable capital gains. Taxable capital gains are computed under subdivision c of Division B of Part I of the Federal Act, primarily under ss. 38, 39 and 40. Section 85 of the Federal Act is relevant in the computation of taxable capital gains because it affects the tax values used in that computation.
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 2(2), 3, 38, 39, 40 and 85</P1></P>
<P>50. The B.C. Act provides that taxable income earned in a year in B.C. is to be determined &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo; the Federal Regulations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Similarly, subsection 1(1) of the B.C. Act defines &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; as having the &ldquo;same meaning&rdquo; as in the Federal Act. For B.C. tax purposes, therefore, taxable income must be calculated using the relevant provisions of the Federal Act. This statutory scheme is how B.C.'s provincial tax base is harmonized with the Federal Act.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The result is that the federal provisions that are relevant to that determination are effectively adopted into the B.C. Act. The B.C. Act does not merely transpose amounts previously computed under federal legislation; it requires a separate determination of those amounts for B.C. tax purposes, which is carried out under the federal provisions. Accordingly, it is possible to misuse or abuse those federal provisions for B.C. purposes.
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 1(1) definition of &ldquo;taxable income earned in a year in British Columbia&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>51. If the B.C. Act were not read as incorporating or adopting those federal provisions, the BC GAAR would be deprived of meaning. It would not apply to transactions that directly result in the avoidance of B.C. tax through the manipulation or abuse of federal provisions that are necessary to compute income and taxable income. There would be no statutory mechanism to protect the integrity of the B.C. tax base. The BC GAAR would effectively be read out of the B.C. Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The federal GAAR could not be used to prevent abuses of federal provisions that result in provincial tax avoidance because it does not recognize the avoidance of provincial tax as a tax benefit or a non-<EM>bona fide</EM> purpose.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. The Tax Collection Agreement between Canada and B.C. does not prevent applying the BC GAAR to protect the provincial tax base, particularly when the provincial tax base is not identical to the federal tax base because only the portion of taxable income allocated to B.C. is taxable provincially.

<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge correctly identified the object, spirit, and purpose of the relevant provisions and found an abuse</TI>
<P>53. It is evident from the trial judge's reasons that he did identify the object, spirit, and purpose of the relevant statutory provisions. He referred to their object, spirit, and purpose throughout his reasons and based his findings that the Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse of the B.C. Act on that understanding. Not only did he find it reasonable to conclude that the Q-Yes plan resulted in abusive tax avoidance, but he found the abuse to be clear. His findings are correct and should not be disturbed.</P>
<P>54. The overall result of the Q-Yes plan is that a B.C. corporation avoided B.C. tax on a substantial capital gain simply by purchasing units of a publicly traded limited partnership carrying on business in Quebec. The trial judge found this result to abuse a range of legislative provisions.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse of s. 85</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The trial judge correctly recognized that, although the <UNDER>effect</UNDER> of s. 85 is to permit a taxpayer to dispose of property without realizing a taxable capital gain on the disposition, the object and spirit of the provision extends to deferring and preserving the tax associated with such a transfer. In light of that object and spirit, the Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse.</P>
<P>56. The trial judge's conclusion reflects that s. 85 functions not only to defer tax that would be payable on a disposition, but to preserve that tax in the hands of both the transferring taxpayer (by fixing the transferor's tax cost of the shares received as consideration for the property) and the receiving corporation (by fixing the corporation's tax cost of the transferred property). It has long been recognized that s. 85 actually creates the potential for double taxation in relation to the deferred gain, and that this consequence is intended.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Continental Bank of Canada v. Canada</SOC><YEAR>1994</YEAR><CITE>94 D.T.C. 1858</CITE><COURTJUR>T.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 107</P1>

<P>57. Rollover provisions like s. 85 permit taxpayers to reorganize the manner in which they hold assets without incurring immediate tax consequences when their underlying economic interest is unchanged. Part of a rollover provision's purpose, therefore, is necessarily to preserve the deferred tax to ensure that it is ultimately paid when the property is disposed of to an arm's length party.
<P1>Stanley E. Edwards, &ldquo;Statutory amalgamations and recapitalizations&rdquo;, 1972 Conference Report (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 1973) 401</P1></P>
<P>58. The trial judge's finding that the Q-Yes plan results in an abuse of s. 85 recognizes that <UNDER>using</UNDER> a provision for a purpose for which it is not intended is an indicator of abuse. The trial judge recognized that s. 85 is ultimately a tax deferring, not a tax relieving, provision. Section 85 is not intended to permit tax to be avoided completely. Yet, in this case, s. 85 was used to avoid the tax completely by putting the ALI shares and the associated gain in the hands of a different taxpayer who could avoid tax completely on 90% of that gain. The trial judge found that using a tax deferral provision in this manner abuses the object and spirit of the provision. His finding echoes statements in other cases considering rollover provisions, and should not be disturbed.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse of the provisions dealing with capital gains</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. The trial judge found the Q-Yes plan to result in an abuse of the provisions of the Federal Act dealing with the computation of income, taxable income, and taxable income earned in British Columbia because the plan permitted a realized capital gain to be included in income but not taxed. The relevant statutory provisions include ss. 3, 38, 39 and 40 of the Federal Act, which provide for the computation of taxable capital gains which are included in taxable income.</P>
<P>60. The Q-Yes plan resulted in capital gains being realized and briefly included in income but then allocated out of the taxable income actually subject to tax. Such transactions frustrate the purpose of the applicable provisions. Although the effect of ss. 3, 38, 39, and 40 is to compute taxable capital gains and include them in income, and does not extend to subjecting those gains to tax, the object and spirit of those provisions is broader. The obvious purpose of those provisions is to subject realized gains on capital to taxation on the same basis as ordinary income, as increases to a taxpayer's economic power. The trial judge found the Q-Yes plan to frustrate that purpose&mdash;a hallmark of abuse.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Q-Yes Plan resulted in an abuse of the provincial income allocation provisions</UNDER></TI>
<P>61. The trial judge correctly found that the Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse of the provincial income allocation provisions in the Federal Act and Regulations. The judge recognized that the allocation formula based on the presence of a permanent establishment is intended to provide a basis for imposing tax liability in the appropriate province. A permanent establishment is the foundation of a corporation's liability to provincial income tax. It is not intended to provide an avenue for avoiding provincial tax.
<P1>Reasons, para. 56 (Appeal Record, Tab 4, p. 48)</P1></P>
<P>62. The trial judge correctly held that by acquiring a permanent establishment in Quebec for the purpose of avoiding B.C. tax when it knew that it would not in fact be liable to Quebec tax, Veracity circumvented the object and spirit of the income allocation provisions and used them for a purpose for which they were not intended.</P>
<P>63. The trial judge also recognized that the object and spirit of the income allocation rules is to ensure that income is neither over-taxed nor under-taxed. It is not limited to preventing taxation of the same income by more than one province. As outlined by Ernest Smith, the purpose of a provincial income allocation formula is to determine the amount of a corporation's taxable income that can rightly be regarded as having been earned in a particular taxing jurisdiction. That determination serves the dual purpose of preventing over-taxation and under-taxation:
<QUOTE><P>...to the extent that different jurisdictions have different answers to the question, &ldquo;What profit should be attributed to the business activities carried on in each jurisdiction?&rdquo;, more or less than 100% of the corporation's profits may be taxed. Unless an appropriate answer to this question is found, the same corporate profits may be taxed at the same time by two or more taxing jurisdictions (double or multiple taxation), or profits that cannot rightly be regarded as having been earned in a particular jurisdiction may be taxed by that jurisdiction (over-taxation, or excessive taxation), or <UNDER>profits that should be taxable in one jurisdiction or another may become incapable of being taxed in any (under-taxation)</UNDER>. (emphasis added)</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Ernest Smith, &ldquo;Allocating to Provinces the Taxable Income of Corporations: How the Federal-Provincial Allocation Rules Evolved&rdquo;, (1976) vol. 24, no. 5 Can Tax. J. 545&ndash;571 at 545</P1></P>
<P>64. The object, spirit, and purpose of a corporate income allocation formula, therefore, is not simply to allocate income to provinces, but to ensure that 100%, not more and not less, of a corporation's taxable income that should be taxed in provinces in which the corporation has a permanent establishment, is allocated to those provinces.</P>
<P>65. Further, the income allocation provisions are intended to ensure that each province receives a fair allocation of revenue. The drafters of the provincial income allocation rules were concerned with legality, acceptability, and fairness both to taxpayers and to provincial treasuries. The purpose is not to provide avenues to avoid tax in a particular province, or to avoid taxation in any province at all.
<P1>Smith at p. 567</P1></P>
<P>66. Accordingly, it is not the absence of tax liability in Quebec that results in an abuse of the income allocation provisions for B.C. purposes; it is the acquisition of a permanent establishment in Quebec and the manipulation of the components of the income allocation formula for the primary purpose of avoiding B.C. tax that results in an abuse of the B.C. provisions.</P>
<P>67. The trial judge further held that, pursuant to the Q-Yes plan, Veracity made contradictory representations to each province about the same income. It filed in Quebec on the basis that 100% of its taxable income in the year ending August 31, 2002 (including the Taxable Gain) was allocable to B.C., while it filed in B.C. on the basis that 90% of that same income (including the Taxable Gain) was allocable to Quebec, not to B.C. The trial judge was correct to describe these as contradictory positions, and he found them to be a clear abuse of the provincial income allocation provisions.</P>
<P>68. In agreeing to harmonize its tax statute with the Federal Act, the B.C. legislature cannot reasonably be taken to have intended that income that would have been taxable in B.C. may be allocated to another province for B.C. tax purposes while in that other province the very same income is allocated to B.C. This is particularly so when the income allocation is the result of avoidance transactions manufactured for the primary purpose of avoiding B.C. tax, and with the knowledge that tax will not be paid in the other province. At that point, the allocation becomes a pretext.</P>
<P>69. The trial judge did not base his finding of abuse on an erroneous assumption that there is a uniform system of provincial taxation in Canada. The trial judge based his finding of abuse on the use that Veracity made of the provincial income allocation provisions under the B.C. Act in order to permanently avoid B.C. tax.</P>
<P>70. In any event, the system of provincial taxation in Canada is more uniform than the appellant argues. There is generally a uniform tax base among the provinces. The relevant inter-provincial difference in this case relates to Quebec's decision to administer and collect its provincial income tax independently, not to different taxation policies in Quebec that do not tax Veracity's income.</P>
<P>71. Although Quebec is not an agreeing province, it has effectively harmonized its tax base with the federal tax base, and its formula for allocating corporate taxable income to Quebec is materially identical to the formula in the Federal Regulations used by the agreeing provinces. Quebec made no policy choice to exempt Veracity's income or to provide a tax holiday for income like Veracity's. Quebec is not the provincial tax haven of Canada.
<P1>Report of the Technical Committee on Business Taxation (Department of Finance Canada, 1997) p. 11.2</P1>
<P1>Smith, <EM>supra</EM> at p. 564 and 565</P1>
<P1>Quebec Act, ss. 27 and 771(2)</P1>
<P1><EM>Regulation respecting the Taxation Act</EM>, C.L.Q.R. c. I-3, r. 1, s. 771R4</P1>
<P1>Reasons, para. 29 (Appeal Record Tab 4, p. 39)</P1></P>
<P>72. The different treatment in Quebec resulted from Quebec's decision to administer its income tax system independently of the federal government and the agreeing provinces. That decision permitted Veracity to select a different taxation year in Quebec than its taxation year for federal and B.C. purposes. Quebec's decision to administer its income tax system separately does not, however, represent a legislative policy of providing avenues for taxpayers in other provinces to avoid tax in their home provinces.

<P>73. Further, the trial judge correctly declined to follow the &ldquo;inter-jurisdictional&rdquo; tax avoidance cases relied on by the appellant (<EM>Husky Energy, Canada Safeway, Inter-Leasing</EM> and <EM>MIL Investments</EM>). Those cases are all distinguishable because they dealt with taxpayers arranging their affairs to take advantage of deliberate policy choices by another jurisdiction either to exempt particular income flows from taxation (such as non-taxation in Ontario of interest income earned by a non-resident corporation with an establishment in Ontario), or to provide tax incentives as a tax haven-like jurisdiction (Luxembourg's decision to provide a &ldquo;participation exemption&rdquo; for shareholdings by a Luxembourg company in a foreign company). In this case, the trial judge recognized that Quebec made no such policy choice and he clearly distinguished those cases.</P>
<P>74. The trial judge recognized that this case is more like <EM>OGT Holdings</EM>, in which the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the application of the Quebec GAAR to prevent tax avoidance resulting from desynchronized federal and Quebec elections. In <EM>OGT Holdings</EM>, as in this case, Ontario did not have a policy of not taxing the capital gain that the taxpayer had deferred in Quebec. Instead, that capital gain never entered the Ontario provincial tax base because of the disconnect between the Quebec and federal s. 85 elections.</P>
<P>75. The Quebec Court of Appeal held that the OGT tax plan &ldquo;twisted&rdquo; and &ldquo;distorted&rdquo; the Quebec provisions by obtaining a deferral that presupposed that the gain would be taxable On a subsequent disposition when the taxpayer knew that the gain would not in fact be taxable and would simply evaporate from the tax base. Accordingly, the tax plan obtained tax deferral treatment on the basis of a &ldquo;pretext&rdquo;.
<P1><UNDER><EM>OGT Holdings Ltd.</EM> (Q.C.A.)</UNDER> at paras. 21&ndash;34</P1></P>
<P>76. The trial judge recognized the similarities between the OGT tax plan and the Q-Yes plan. Veracity allocated $8.7 million of taxable income to Quebec for B.C. purposes with the knowledge that it would allocate all of that same income back to B.C. for Quebec purposes and the income would never be subject to Quebec tax.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>The Q-Yes plan resulted in an abuse of the &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxation year&rdquo; provisions</UNDER></TI>
<P>77. The trial judge correctly held that the Q-Yes plan results in an abuse of the &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; provisions in the B.C. Act. The abuse does not result from Veracity's selection of a Quebec fiscal period, but from the selection of a B.C. fiscal period as part of a plan to avoid B.C. tax.</P>
<P>78. The legislative provisions respecting fiscal periods and taxation years permit a corporation to select the period for which tax is computed and reported annually. The statutory scheme requires a corporation to select a fiscal period, which becomes the corporation's taxation year. Under the B.C. Act, &ldquo;taxation year&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; have the same meaning as in the Federal Act. The Federal Act defines fiscal period as the period for which the accounts of a business are made up for purposes of assessment under the Act. The only limit on the selection of a fiscal period under the Federal Act is that the period may not exceed 53 weeks.
<P1>B.C. Act, s. 1 definitions of &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxation year&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>Federal Act, ss. 249(1) and 249.1(1)</P1></P>
<P>79. The object and spirit of the fiscal period provisions is clear: to facilitate the regular and periodic reporting of tax results. The choice of fiscal period can be influenced by numerous factors, including business, financial and tax reporting purposes. There would not normally be a commercial justification for selecting different fiscal periods in different jurisdictions for the same income in the same year. The flexibility accorded by the legislative scheme does not extend to providing a means to time fiscal periods so as to render provincial tax optional.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fredette v. The Queen</SOC><YEAR>2001</YEAR><CITE>55 D.T.C. 621</CITE><COURTJUR>T.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 64&ndash;68</P1>
<P1>IC 88-2, <EM>General Anti Avoidance Rule</EM>, October 21, 1988, para. 2</P1></P>
<P>80. The trial judge found that the primary purpose in selecting a June 30 B.C. fiscal period was to avoid B.C. tax through the Q-Yes plan. That purpose was achieved by selecting a fiscal period that allowed the Taxable Gain to be reported in B.C. after an allocation of revenues and salaries by Gaz Metro had occurred.</P>
<P>81. The purpose in selecting an August 31 fiscal period end in Quebec was clearly to ensure that the Taxable Gain was reported after the Gaz Metro acquisition but before any revenue/salary allocation by Gaz. That timing ensured that no tax would be payable in Quebec.</P>
<P>82. The trial judge's comment that the entire plan &ldquo;pivoted&rdquo; on the anomalous provision in Quebec recognizes that the Q-Yes plan would have held no attraction to Veracity if it had to pay Quebec tax. However, the choice of Quebec fiscal period did not contribute to the avoidance of B.C. tax. Veracity avoided B.C. tax through selecting a B.C. fiscal period that enabled it to purchase Gaz Metro units and to receive an allocation of revenues and salaries before reporting the Taxable Gain in B.C.</P>
<P>83. Accordingly, the trial judge did not apply the BC GAAR to Veracity's use of a Quebec legislative provision and did not override a legislative policy choice of Quebec. Denying the tax benefit realized in B.C. is unrelated to whether or not Veracity is entitled to select the Quebec fiscal period of its choosing.</P>
<P>84. Further, although the primary purpose for selecting the Quebec fiscal period was to avoid Quebec tax, that transaction was an integral part of the Q-Yes plan and is a relevant consideration under the BC GAAR. An avoidance transaction includes a transaction undertaken primarily to avoid tax under any other federal or provincial Act, including Quebec, and where that transaction results in an abuse of the B.C. Act the BC GAAR will apply.
<P1>B.C. Act, ss. 68.1(1) definition of &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo; para. (c)(ii)</P1></P>
<P>85. The trial judge recognized that the flexibility permitted in the choice of fiscal period for federal and B.C. tax purposes is not intended to facilitate tax avoidance. The Q-Yes plan twisted and distorted the fiscal period principles by using that flexibility to avoid tax completely, which is not contemplated by those provisions.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Crown's basic errors</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Crown's argument in this Court is based on the same incorrect premise as the decision under appeal&mdash;that provincial tax &ldquo;ought to have been paid somewhere&rdquo; (see &para;19&ndash;21 of Veracity's factum).</P>
<P>2. The GAAR is an exceptional provision and the Crown errs in stating the contrary in &para;42 of its factum; see <CASEREF><SOC>Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 63</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2011] 3 S.C.R. 721</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, &para;66. <CASEREF><SOC>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2005] 2 S.C.R. 601</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>). Under the GAAR, Parliament has conferred on the court the unusual duty of going behind the words of legislation to determine the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions relied upon by the taxpayer. The court may override the treatment afforded by those provisions but only if the Crown can identify an unambiguous policy that underlies the relevant provisions and demonstrate clear abuse. The standard is high.</P>
<P>3. Because of the GAAR's exceptional nature, the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed on several occasions the analytical discipline that must be followed in considering the GAAR. This ensures that the GAAR does not become a standardless sweep.</P>
<P>4. An uninformed subjective impression as to what ought to be taxed, or what the tax consequences of a transaction ought to be, has no place in a GAAR analysis. That is especially so at the stage where it is necessary to determine, as a matter of law, the object and purpose of any taxing provision that is alleged to have been abused or misused.</P>
<P>5. The Crown's factum is replete with rhetoric about provincial tax avoidance but skips over the rigour required to demonstrate abuse based on the text, context and purpose of the provisions of the BC Act relied on by Veracity. The Crown does not come close to discharging the heavy burden of proving that the BC GAAR applies.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The provincial tax scheme</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. The Crown's incorrect premise reflects a misunderstanding of the scheme of provincial taxation. Contrary to &para;61&ndash;66 of the Crown's factum, the provinces have NOT created a comprehensive provincial tax net that catches or is intended to catch all income (see the Veracity factum, paragraphs &para;42&ndash;46 and &para;66&ndash;83).</P>
<P>7. And contrary to &para;63&ndash;65 of the Crown's factum, the purpose of the provincial allocation rules is not to prevent under-taxation. The Smith article cited by the Crown does not support the Crown's argument. Smith observes that only if there is perfect harmonization among jurisdictions will 100% of a corporation's profits (not more not less) be taxed. Both double taxation and non-taxation could be avoided if all provinces had identical allocation rules and measured taxable income at the same time.</P>
<P>8. That hypothetical harmonized system does not exist. Quebec's taxation year rule permitted taxpayers to measure income at different times. When that variable is different for different provinces, income can be double-taxed or not taxed at all. In the context of tax law, timing is everything (see Arnold et al in <EM>&ldquo;Timing and Income Taxation&rdquo;</EM> at p. 3).</P>
<P>9. Quebec chose not to harmonize its taxation year rules with those of the other provinces. The obvious and well understood consequence of that choice is that some income of a taxpayer who is taxable in Quebec and another province might fall between provincial tax nets. However, that cannot possibly mean, as the Crown suggests in &para;66 of its factum, that it is an abuse of the BC Act for a BC taxpayer to become at the same time a Quebec taxpayer by acquiring a permanent establishment in Quebec.</P>
<P>10. Contrary to &para;70&ndash;73 of the Crown's factum, Quebec's permissive rule for choosing a taxation year is not simply part of Quebec's decision to administer its income tax system independently. Both the determination of the type of income that will be taxed and when it will be measured affect the income that will be taxed by a province. Quebec's unique rule permitting a different taxation year is one of hundreds of provisions in the Quebec Act that reflect deliberate tax policy choices made by the Quebec legislature, upon which all Quebec taxpayers are entitled to rely. The Crown cannot rely on the BC GAAR to remedy its grievance that because Veracity became liable to Quebec tax, BC was allocated only 10.2% of Veracity's capital gain.

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The trial judge did not &ldquo;clearly distinguish&rdquo; guiding appellate authority</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. Veracity says (see &para;47&ndash;51 of the Veracity factum) that the appellate court decisions in <UNDER><EM>Husky Energy</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Canada Safeway</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Inter-Leasing</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>MIL Investments</EM></UNDER> are central to this case. These cases support the conclusion that it was not an abuse of the BC Act for Veracity to take advantage of Quebec's taxation year rule. The Crown's response (&para;73 of the Crown's factum) is that the judge &ldquo;clearly distinguished&rdquo; these cases. The judge does not mention any of these cases in his reasons for judgment. He did not even address these cases, let alone &ldquo;clearly distinguish&rdquo; them.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Crown has not met its burden of establishing a clear abuse of the BC Act</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. The Crown states incorrectly, at &para;80 of its factum, that the trial judge found that the primary purpose in selecting a June 30 BC year end was to avoid BC tax. The trial judge held that the selection of different fiscal periods was an avoidance transaction and that the entire plan pivoted on the anomalous Quebec provision.</P>
<P>13. Although the Crown identifies, at &para;77&ndash;85 of its factum, the object and purpose of certain provisions of the BC Act (specifically, the provisions dealing with &ldquo;fiscal period&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxation year&rdquo;), and states that Veracity made use of them to avoid tax (which is admitted), the Crown has failed to specify how those provisions were abused, except to assert that they were not intended to facilitate tax avoidance.</P>
<P>14. That falls far short of the substantial burden on the Crown to establish clear abuse of a provision of the BC Act. In determining misuse or abuse, it is not enough to assert that the provisions relied upon by the taxpayer are not intended to provide a means of avoiding tax. If that were enough, the GAAR would apply in every case, and the misuse or abuse test would be meaningless; see <CASEREF><SOC>Inter-Leasing, Inc. v. Ontario (Revenue)</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 575</CITE><PARANUM>66</PARANUM></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>The approach taken by the appeal judge&mdash;to define the purpose of the provision as to raise revenue and to define the tax base as broadly as possible&mdash;renders &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; any transaction that has the effect of reducing tax. I do not accept this approach.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>15. Nor is it enough to assert, as the Crown does in &para;68 of its factum, that the legislature did not foresee a particular result. It is well established that the GAAR cannot be used to fill gaps in legislation, even if the transaction was not foreseen by the legislature (see the Veracity factum at &para;33). In any event, the gap at issue in this case is in the Quebec Act and the Quebec legislature responded.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>The Crown's reliance on provisions of the federal Act</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. With respect to paragraphs &para;45, &para;49&ndash;51, and &para;55&ndash;60 of the Crown's factum, Veracity does not dispute that the BC GAAR may apply to the abuse of a provision that is incorporated by reference into the BC Act. However, such incorporation by reference must be expressly stated in the BC Act.</P>
<P>17. Contrary to the Crown's argument, none of the provisions of the federal Act that the judge found to have been abused (ss. 3, 38, 39, 40 and 85) are incorporated by reference into the BC Act. It is imprecise and inaccurate to say they are &ldquo;effectively adopted&rdquo; into the BC Act. Therefore, it was not open to the judge to find that the BC GAAR applied to what he concluded was an abuse of any of those provisions (see paragraphs &para;37&ndash;41 and &para;84&ndash;86 of Veracity's factum).</P>
<P>18. Veracity's interpretation of the BC GAAR does not deprive the BC GAAR of meaning, as the Crown argues in &para;51 of its factum. The BC GAAR applies to tax avoidance transactions that abuse any provision of the BC Act, such as the numerous tax credits that BC provides to meet provincial policy objectives and other specific provisions specific to BC. But the BC GAAR has a limited scope. The legislature of BC enacted a BC GAAR which does not extend to misuses or abuses of provisions of the federal Act, in sharp contrast to the Ontario GAAR. The plain text of the BC GAAR is consistent with BC's status as an agreeing province, and its agreement to use the federal taxable base. It is not for this Court to legislate a change to the BC GAAR.</P>
<P>19. In any event, the provisions of the federal Act cited by the Crown were not abused. See &para;85&ndash;88 of Veracity's factum.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Responses to specific points made by the Crown</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. The Crown cites at &para;38 of its factum two cases in which the courts found certain transactions to be abusive and commented that this conclusion was confirmed by their &ldquo;vacuous or artificial&rdquo; nature. To be clear, the judge did not find that the transactions in this case were vacuous or artificial.</P>
<P>21. In <UNDER><EM>Canada Trustco</EM></UNDER>, the Crown made similar allegations, as it does in many GAAR cases, about the transactions at issue (see &para;57&ndash;60). The Supreme Court of Canada was not distracted by the rhetoric and found that the Crown had failed to meet the high standard for demonstrating abuse. The GAAR did not apply.</P>
<P>22. All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>
