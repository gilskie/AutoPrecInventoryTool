<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL</TI>
<P>Take notice that Gize Yebeyo Araya, Kesete Tekle Fshazion and Mihretab Yemane Tekle, the Appellants, hereby apply for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from the order of The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, pronounced the 18th day of January, 2019, at Vancouver, British Columbia.</P>

<P1>&timesb; Chambers Judgment</P1></P>
<P>2. If the appeal is from an appeal under Rule 18-3 or 23-6 (8) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules or Rule 18-3 or 22-7 (8) of the Supreme Court Family Rules, name the maker of the original decision, direction or order: N/A</P>
<P>3. Please identify which of the following is involved in the appeal:

<P1>&square; Equity</P1>
<P1>&square; Wills and Estates</P1></P>
<P>And further take notice that the Court of Appeal will be moved at the hearing of this application for an order that:</P>
<P>1. this Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal stands as a Notice of Appeal of the order of Mr. Justice Abrioux of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, pronounced the 18th day of January, 2019, in which his Lordship granted, in part, the Defendant's application regarding waiver of privilege (the &ldquo;Order&rdquo;);</P>
<P>2. alternatively, if leave to appeal is required, that leave be given to appeal the Order;</P>
<P>3. the appeal be allowed and the Order be set aside;</P>
<P>4. the appellants have costs of this appeal; and</P>
<P>5. such further and other relief be granted as to this Honourable Court seems just.</P>
<P>The grounds of appeal are:</P>
<P>1. the Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux erred in law or principle by finding that the plaintiffs in each of the related actions, other than the Araya Action, have, by pleading postponement, waived privilege over communications and documents relating to the first meeting between each plaintiff and Canadian counsel;</P>
<P>2. further or alternatively, even if the plaintiffs in each of the related actions, other than the Araya Action, have waived privilege over some communications and documents relating to the first meeting between each plaintiff and Canadian counsel, the Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux erred by ordering broader production of privileged documents and communications than what is necessary to achieve a just result; and</P>
<P>3. further or alternatively, the Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux erred in law or principle by ordering that the plaintiffs in the related actions shall produce documents relating to or containing the particulars of the retainer or engagement of Ms. Elsa Chyrum by their counsel within 45 days of the date of the Order.</P>
<P>The hearing of this proceeding occupied 2 days.</P>
<P>Dated at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 8th day of February, 2019.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>The plaintiffs are all refugees who have fled Eritrea. They appeal the chambers judge's declaration that, by pleading that any applicable limitation periods were postponed until they had access to the Canadian legal counsel necessary to discover their claims, they have implicitly waived privilege over all communications and documents relating to their first meeting with Canadian counsel. They also appeal the chambers judge's order that they produce documents setting out the particulars of their counsel's engagement of Ms. Elizabeth Chyrum, who is retained by counsel to communicate with the plaintiffs in relation to the litigation. Although the appeal arises out of a pre-trial application brought by the defendant, Nevsun Resources Ltd. (&ldquo;Nevsun&rdquo;), the jurisdictional basis for the chambers judge's declaration was his inherent jurisdiction, not the provisions of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> that govern the pre-trial discovery process.</P>
<P>The chambers judge erred in his approach to assessing whether the pleadings led to a waiver of solicitor-client privilege over the documents and communications relating to each of the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel. Specifically, he erred in not considering whether, through the pleadings, the plaintiffs had relied on legal advice that might have been communicated at those first meetings. Any legal advice conveyed at these meetings is irrelevant to the ultimate task of assessing whether the plaintiffs' claims were discoverable before the date upon which they each first met Canadian counsel and had access to Canadian legal advice. The chambers judge therefore erred in granting a declaration of waiver of privilege over communications relating to the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel. Alternatively, the scope of the declaration is overly broad.</P>
<P>In addition, the chambers judge also erred by ordering the plaintiffs to produce documents relating to the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer. These documents would normally be covered by litigation privilege. However, the plaintiffs had no opportunity to establish the privilege and the chambers judge failed to consider the principles of litigation privilege when ordering their production. This too was an error.</P></BLOCK1>

<P>4. In its responses to civil claim, Nevsun asserts as a defence the expiration of the applicable limitation period, either under Eritrean law, or in the alternative, under the <EM>Limitation Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Limitation Act</EM>, SBC 2012, c 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In reply, the plaintiffs have pleaded that the actions are not subject to any limitation period. In the alternative, however, the plaintiffs plead that any applicable limitation period was postponed until at least the time when each of the plaintiffs accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g., Reply at para 1 in <CASEREF><SOC>Alemayo v.

<P>5. The plaintiffs plead that before their first meeting with Canadian counsel, they lacked the means to discover that a court action in British Columbia was an appropriate way to seek a remedy against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. Amended Reply at paras 8&ndash;11 in <CASEREF><SOC>Negash et al v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><DOCKET>SCBC Action No. S-1610863</DOCKET></CASEREF>, filed February 13, 2018, AR, Tab 9, p. 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Under s. 8 of the <EM>Limitation Act</EM>, the plaintiffs' claims are not discoverable until they knew or reasonably ought to have known the necessary material facts and that a court proceeding against Nevsun would be an appropriate means to seek a remedy for their injuries.</P>
<P>6. Following delivery of the replies, Nevsun brought an application alleging that by pleading postponement, the plaintiffs in each of the Related Actions had implicitly waived privilege over all communications and documents relating to the pursuit of the actions up until the date that each of the claims were filed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application, at para 1, AR, Tab 13, pp. 128-129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> At the hearing, Nevsun narrowed its allegations of waiver due to postponement, other than in the Araya Action, to the time period leading up to, and including, the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel.</P>
<P>7. Since Nevsun first raised the issue of waiver of privilege, the plaintiffs have not disputed that the postponement pleadings put in issue the plaintiffs' state of mind regarding the extent to which they had knowledge of the core ingredients of the lawsuit prior to their first meeting with Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit #8 of Roxanne Dhanpaul, sworn December 12, 2018 (&ldquo;Dhanpaul #8&rdquo;), Exhibits M and N, Appellants' Appeal Book (&ldquo;AB&rdquo;), Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI><UNDER>Application for Production of Third Party Communications</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. In addition to the application for a declaration that solicitor-client privilege had been waived due to the postponement pleadings, Nevsun sought a declaration that no litigation or solicitor-client privilege attached to all communications between and amongst the plaintiffs and Ms. Chyrum and other third parties involved in the coordination and pursuit of the Related Actions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application at para 4, AR, Tab 13, p. 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Alternatively, Nevsun sought a declaration that the plaintiffs had waived privilege over these documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application at para 5, AR, Tab 13, p. 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On examinations for discovery, counsel for the plaintiffs had objected to questions concerning communications between Ms. Chyrum and the plaintiffs following their initial meeting with counsel on the basis of solicitor-client and litigation privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. Affidavit #9 of Roxanne Dhanpaul, filed April 15, 2019 (&ldquo;Dhanpaul #9&rdquo;), Exhibit A at Q765, AB, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. In their responding materials, the plaintiffs provided evidence that Ms. Chyrum is an agent of counsel who is retained to communicate with clients, witnesses and potential clients.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit #9 of Kimberly Hill, made December 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Hill #9&rdquo;), at para 4, 2; Affidavit#1 of Dimitri Lascaris, made December 21, 2018, at para 3, AB, Tab 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>2)</EM></N><TI><EM>Reasons of the Chambers Judge</EM></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI><UNDER>Reasons on Waiver of Privilege</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. In oral reasons, later released in writing, the chambers judge granted Nevsun's application in part. The chambers judge declared that by pleading postponement, the plaintiffs had &ldquo;waived privilege over all communications and documents, in any way relating to the pursuit of the Actions or the claims advanced therein, by reason of the plea of postponement asserted in the reply&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order Made After Application of Mr. Justice Abrioux, entered February 21, 2019 (&ldquo;Order&rdquo;) para 2, AR, Tab 15, p. 149.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. For the plaintiffs in the Related Actions other than the Araya Action, the chambers judge found that the waiver extended to the date upon which each of the plaintiffs met Canadian counsel for the first time, and included all documents (other than retainer agreements) prepared in contemplation of, or which record or refer to what occurred at these first meetings.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 112-113, AR, Tab 16, pp. 177-178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The chambers judge concluded that the waiver should include what occurred at the first meeting with counsel &ldquo;since it could only be as a result of the meeting that the plaintiffs' state of mind would have transitioned from one of without knowledge or certainty to that of was a reasonable likelihood of success against Nevsun in a Canadian court.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 90, AR, Tab 16, pp. 173-174.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On this point, the chambers judge relied on a 2014 journal article by an Ontario lawyer, Jonathan de Vries, in which Mr. de Vries argues that the a plea that the limitation period has been postponed should give rise to an implied waiver of privilege over solicitor-client communications that at least extends up to and includes the putative discovery date so that the &ldquo;paradigm shift&rdquo; in the plaintiff's state of knowledge of a claim can be tested by the defendant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 80 and 90, AR, Tab 16, pp. 171&ndash;174; Jonathan de Vries, &ldquo;Privilege and Limitations: The Impact of Raising the Discoverability of Claims on Solicitor-Client Privilege&rdquo;, (2014) 43 Advocates Quarterly 219&ndash;256 (&ldquo;de Vries&rdquo;) at 252.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. As the plaintiffs indicated that they intended to apply to amend the pleadings in the Araya Action, the chambers judge adjourned Nevsun's application in relation to that action. The chambers judge ordered the plaintiffs to produce the documents over which privilege had been waived within 45 days of the date of the order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 112, AR, Tab 16, pp. 177-178.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>Production of the Particulars of Ms. Chyrum's Retainer</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. Before the chambers judge, Nevsun narrowed its request for a broad declaration that no privilege attached to all communications between Ms. Chyrum and the plaintiffs to one based on specific objections for solicitor-client and litigation privilege made by the plaintiffs' counsel at examinations for discovery.</P>
<P>14. Nevsun also took significant issue with the evidence that Ms. Chyrum was an agent of counsel retained to communicate with clients and potential clients because Ms. Chyrum had also previously served as a translator on some of the plaintiffs' affidavits. None of these affidavits were at issue on this application. Nevsun had previously alleged that Ms. Chyrum's translations raised a spectre of bias in the context of a 2016 application, which the chambers judge had rejected.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya 2016</EM> at paras 216-217.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Nevsun had not requested production of Ms. Chyrum's affidavit in its notice of application and nor did it apply for production of Ms. Chyrum's retainer at the hearing. Nevertheless, the chambers judge ordered that the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer agreement with Canadian counsel be disclosed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 109, AR, Tab 16, p. 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The chambers judge found that production of the particulars of her retainer agreement &ldquo;may well assist in delineating Ms. Chyrum's precise role while acting as a third party agent for counsel and/or be material to any potential allegations of bias arising from her translator and interpreter functions.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 109, AR, Tab 16, p. 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The chambers judge declined to make specific rulings on the objections at the examinations for discovery. He left it to counsel to determine the validity of the objections based on his reasons concerning waiver of privilege and granted the parties leave to make further submissions on any unresolved issues.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 110-111, AR, Tab 16, p. 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>3)</EM></N><TI><EM>Leave to Appeal not Required</EM></TI>
<P>17. The parties appeared before Mr. Justice Butler on March 18, 2019 on the plaintiffs' application for an order directing that leave to appeal was not required, or alternatively, an order granting leave to appeal. Mr. Justice Butler granted the plaintiffs' application. He reasoned that as the jurisdictional basis of the declaration was the Court's inherent jurisdiction, leave to appeal was not required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya Leave</EM> at paras 25-26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Had leave to appeal been required, he found that the test for leave had been met in any event.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya Leave</EM> at para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He also ordered that execution of the order be stayed pending disposition of this appeal.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ERRORS IN JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>18. The plaintiffs submit that the chambers judge erred as follows:
<P1>(a) by declaring that the plaintiffs had waived solicitor-client privilege over communications relating to their first meeting with Canadian counsel when the plaintiffs do not put legal advice that may have been received at these meetings at issue;</P1>
<P1>(b) alternatively, even if there was an implicit waiver of privilege, the chambers judge erred by making a broad declaration of waiver not limited to the issue of whether the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known prior to meeting Canadian counsel that an action against Nevsun in Canada would be appropriate; and</P1>
<P1>(c) further, the chambers judge erred by ordering the production of litigation privileged communications concerning the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer.</P1></P>
<P>19. Each of these issues are reviewable on a standard of correctness. The first two issues involves questions concerning the identification and application of the test for implied waiver of privilege. This is a question of law reviewable on a correctness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v.

<BLOCK2><N><EM>1)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Postponement Pleadings Do Not Implicitly Waive Privilege</EM></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI><UNDER>Declarations of Waiver of Privilege are Discouraged</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. The order below declares that the plaintiffs have waived privilege over a broad swath of documents and communications up to and including the date upon which each of the plaintiffs first met Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Order at para 2, AR, Tab 15, p. 149.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead of challenging specific objections at examinations for discovery or claims of privilege over specific documents, Nevsun applied for a broad and general declaration that applies across ten related actions and the claims of over eighty plaintiffs. The jurisdictional basis of the order was the chambers judge's inherent jurisdiction, not the provisions of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> that govern the pre-trial discovery process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya Leave</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. In <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court recently disapproved of a similar approach to that taken by Nevsun here. Like Nevsun, the respondents in <EM>HMB</EM> sought a broad declaration not tied to particular documents or questions on discovery. Writing for the Court, Justice Hunter reasoned that such an approach was only appropriate in rare circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 263</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>HMB</EM>&rdquo;) at para 36 leave to appeal dismissed <CASEREF><CITE>2019 CanLII 18828</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He noted that while declarations of privilege are within the court's inherent jurisdiction to make, the practice of challenging privilege in this way &ldquo;enhances the danger that a waiver order will be made in circumstances that do not adequately protect the privilege.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. This danger was realized once again here. As Justice Butler noted, Nevsun's application cast &ldquo;a very broad net and the declaration in the Order is similarly broad.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya Leave</EM> at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Although the chambers judge referred in passing to the &ldquo;virtually sacrosanct status&rdquo; of solicitor-client privilege, the order does not give appropriate attention to the high, bright-line bar this Court has set for findings of implicit waiver of solicitor-client privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As discussed in further detail below, Nevsun's decision to proceed in this way led to a very broad order that applies generally in the litigation and that is not tailored to the particular circumstances of each plaintiff or limited to particular documents or questions on discovery.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>The Chambers Judge Applied the Wrong Test</UNDER></TI>
<P>23. In <EM>Soprema</EM>, this Court was clear that a pleading that invokes a party's &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; is insufficient to ground a waiver of privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at paras 48-49, 52; see also <EM>HMB</EM> at paras 44 and 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> After extensively reviewing the case law and applicable principles, Justice Harris concluded that to waive privilege &ldquo;a party must voluntarily inject into the litigation legal advice it received or its understanding of the law&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The fact that legal advice may be relevant to or may have influenced the party's state of mind is insufficient.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. In <EM>HMB</EM>, Justice Hunter further clarified that for a party to have put its understanding of the law at issue more &ldquo;than a statement of a litigant's understanding of the law&rdquo; is required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at para 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Even an admission by a party that he or she relied on legal advice is insufficient.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sopinka, Lederman &amp; Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada</EM>, 5th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada, 2018) at &sect;14.159 (&ldquo;<EM>Sopinka</EM>&rdquo;), cited in <EM>HMB</EM> at para 43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Implied waiver requires pleadings, evidence or argument that asserts actual reliance on the legal advice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at paras 46-47.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. In a passage cited favourably in <EM>HMB</EM>, the authors of <EM>Sopinka, Lederman &amp; Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada</EM>, 5th ed., state that waiver requires a party to have chosen &ldquo;to use the legal advice as a substantive element of his or her claim or defence.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sopinka</EM> at &sect;14.159 quoting <CASEREF><SOC>Creative Career Systems Inc. v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 649</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF> (<EM>&ldquo;Creative Career Stystems&rdquo;</EM>), cited in <EM>HMB</EM> at para 43.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. In <CASEREF><SOC>Mickelson v. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Iyer helpfully reformulated the principles set out in <EM>Soprema</EM> into the following three requirements, all of which must be established before solicitor-client privilege is implicitly waived:
<P1>(a) the state of mind of the party asserting the privilege is an element of a claim or defence;</P1>
<P1>(b) the party asserting the privilege is known to have received legal advice relating to that issue; and</P1>
<P1>(c) the party asserting the privilege is relying on the legal advice to justify its conduct.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mickelson v. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1584</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF>; see also <CASEREF><SOC>Turner Lane Development Corporation v. Levelton Consultants Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 1940</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM></CASEREF>, where Master Bouck reformulated the same requirements into a three-part test.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>27. The common thread in this recent case law is that waiver of privilege requires a party to have voluntarily injected legal advice or its understanding of the law into the litigation by relying on legal advice as a justification or explanation for its conduct.</P>
<P>28. Instead of applying these principles, the chambers judge relied on Nevsun's submission for the proposition that &ldquo;[a] party waives privilege where he puts his state of mind at issue with respect to legal knowledge in the litigation.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 72-73, AR, Tab 16, p. 170; See Nevsun's Notice of Application, para 2, AR, Tab 13, p. 129.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This proposition is consistent with statements found in earlier authority such as <CASEREF><SOC>Camosun College v. Levelton Engineering Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Camosun College v. Levelton Engineering Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 1190</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF> (<EM>&ldquo;Camosun College&rdquo;</EM>).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> however, without further explanation it is incomplete. Without the further stipulation that waiver requires a party to have <UNDER>relied</UNDER> on legal advice to justify its conduct, the statement is inconsistent with <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM>. The proposition resembles the reasoning of the trial judge in <EM>Soprema</EM>, who found that implicit waiver may occur if a party puts &ldquo;its &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; in issue in a manner establishing a clear nexus between its state of mind and the privileged communications.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As Justice Harris concluded, this is insufficient to establish waiver.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at paras 3-4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> For waiver to be implied, a party must have voluntarily injected the legal advice or its understanding of law into the litigation by relying on legal advice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 49; <EM>HMB</EM> at paras 46-47.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. By basing his analysis on an incomplete statement of the law on waiver of privilege, the chambers judge considered the wrong factors when he assessed whether the plaintiffs had waived privilege over their first meeting with Canadian counsel. Nowhere in his reasons did the chambers judge consider whether the plaintiffs rely on the legal advice they may have received upon their first meeting with Canadian counsel. Instead, the chambers judge's reasons are focused on assessing the potential relevancy of legal advice to the question of discoverability and the pleading of postponement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 74 and 90, AR, Tab 16, pp. 170 and 173-174.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. Also, while the plaintiffs acknowledge that the pleadings put their states of mind before meeting with Canadian counsel at issue, it is not clear whether any of the plaintiffs received legal advice on the possibility of legal action against Nevsun prior to first meeting Canadian counsel. This reemphasizes the dangers inherent in the procedure Nevsun followed below. The broad declaration it sought does not allow for the individualized inquiry the waiver of privilege assessment calls for.</P>
<P>31. In many ways, the chambers judge's approach is similar to that taken by the chambers judge in <EM>HMB</EM>, which was rejected by this Court. In that case, the chambers judge had accepted the theory that when the plaintiffs &ldquo;asserted that they filed the Conspiracy Claim when the did because of a concern about a limitation period, they must have had legal advice on that subject, and the reference to limitation periods constituted a waiver of the legal advice received by them.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at para 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The reasons at issue here make a similar speculative leap. The chambers judge's finding of a waiver of privilege over the first meeting with counsel is based on his conclusion that &ldquo;it could only be as a result of the meeting that the plaintiffs' state of mind would have transitioned from one of without knowledge or certainty to that of was a reasonable likelihood of success against Nevsun in a Canadian court.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 90, AR, Tab 16, pp. 173-174.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In effect, the chambers judge assumed that the privileged communications that occurred at that meeting were relevant to assessing the plaintiffs' pleas of postponement.</P>
<P>33. That this speculation was necessary demonstrates that the plaintiffs' reply pleadings do not inject the legal advice they may have received at these meetings into the litigation. The plaintiffs do not plead that legal advice they received at their first meetings with Canadian counsel was what made their claims against Nevsun discoverable. Instead, the plaintiffs plead that it was the <UNDER>access to</UNDER> legal advice from Canadian counsel that allowed them to discover that a claim against Nevsun in Canada would be appropriate.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI><UNDER>The Reply Pleadings Do Not Rely on Legal Advice Received at the First Meetings</UNDER></TI>
<P>34. The pleadings themselves do not incorporate any legal advice that may have been communicated at these meetings as a substantive element of the plaintiffs' reply. In pleading that any applicable limitation period was postponed &ldquo;until at least the time when they accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. Reply at para 8 in <CASEREF><SOC>Mekonen v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><DOCKET>SCBC Action No. S-184108</DOCKET></CASEREF>, filed May 25, 2018, AR, Tab 11, p. 108.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the plaintiffs do not inject any legal advice that may have been received at these meetings as an issue in the litigation. While the passage references legal advice, the pleadings do not incorporate that legal advice as part of their pleas of postponement. The reply pleadings make the point that the plaintiffs were unable to bring the action until they had access to lawyers willing and able to represent them. Access to legal advice is a pleaded precursor to the discovery of the claims, but legal advice is not the basis for the postponement plea.</P>
<P>35. Similarly, the other references in the reply pleadings to legal advice do not put the plaintiffs' possible reliance on that legal advice into issue. For example, in evaluating whether the &ldquo;plaintiffs' claims against Nevsun involve complex and novel issues of domestic tort law and customary international law&rdquo; it is not necessary to assess the plaintiffs' state of mind. The issue of whether the action is complex is a question for the court to decide. Legal advice the plaintiffs may have received on this issue upon first meeting with Canadian counsel is irrelevant to that assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See <EM>Creative Career Systems</EM> at para 33: &ldquo;Similarly, it is irrelevant to the lawsuit that the Plaintiffs may have obtained legal advice to support their assertion that they owned the private career colleges. Ultimately, the court will decide the ownership issue based on facts that do not include either party's lawyer's legal opinion about ownership.&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. That the plaintiffs do not rely on the legal advice communicated at these first meetings is demonstrated by the fact that the content of any legal advice that may have been provided is irrelevant to assessing the strength of the plaintiffs' pleas of postponement. No matter what advice they received during the first meeting, the communications do not shed light on whether the plaintiffs could have discovered earlier that a court action in British Columbia was an appropriate means of proceeding. Whether counsel told the plaintiffs at these meetings that a case against Nevsun in British Columbia had a strong chance, a weak chance or no chance of success at all, it makes no difference when assessing whether the plaintiffs could have discovered the claims any earlier than the day on which they first met with Canadian counsel. In the absence of relevancy, it is difficult to see how the pleadings put in issue the plaintiffs' reliance on these communications.</P>
<P>37. The only portion of the privileged communications that occurred at the first meetings that could possibly be relevant to assessing the plaintiffs' claims of postponement is information from the plaintiffs about what steps they previously took to seek legal redress or the knowledge they had about the lawsuit before the meeting.</P>
<P>38. However, Nevsun does not require access to the plaintiffs' legal file to investigate and inquire about these issues. The plaintiffs have always acknowledged that the postponement pleadings put into issue the plaintiffs' state of mind regarding the extent to which they had knowledge of the core ingredients of the lawsuit prior to first meeting Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Dhanpaul #8, Exhibits M and N, AB, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nevsun has explored these issues on discovery.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. Dhanpaul #9, Exhibit A at Q 736&ndash;762, AB, Tab 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Further, and more fundamentally, relevancy does not drive waiver of privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 52.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While preventing Nevsun from accessing privileged communications relating to these first meeting might deny Nevsun access to some potentially relevant material concerning what occurred before the plaintiffs first met with Canadian counsel, this is an appropriate consequence of the fair recognition of solicitor-client privilege. On this issue, Justice Harris's reasons in <EM>Soprema</EM> are squarely on point:
<QUOTE><P>I do not think one can properly describe a litigation advantage &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; when it results from the recognition and protection of a fundamentally important principle in the legal system. Furthermore, protecting privilege in these circumstances does not raise an issue of inconsistency because the party asserting the privilege is not relying on the advice it received to justify its conduct at the same time as it shields that advice from disclosure.</P>
<P><EM>(Soprema</EM> at para 53)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>40. Here, the plaintiffs do not rely on the legal advice they may have received at their first meetings with Canadian counsel as a justification for not having brought their claims sooner. Nor do the pleadings rely on a change in legal advice. There is no unfairness to Nevsun as a result.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>d)</N><TI><UNDER>A Pleading of Postponement Does Not Automatically Leads to Waiver of Privilege Over the Pleaded Discovery Date</UNDER></TI>
<P>41. Not only does the application of the principles recently set out by this Court in <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM> require that the order below be set aside, the authorities the chambers judge relied on below do not support the proposition that a postponement claim necessarily leads to a waiver of privilege over the pleaded discovery date.</P>
<P>42. First, the authorities the chambers judge relied on below were decided prior to <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM>. To the extent that any of them suggest that waiver of privilege is established by the mere fact that a party puts its state of mind at issue, or because privileged communications might be relevant to an issue in dispute, they are inconsistent with this Court's recent jurisprudence and this reasoning should not be followed. The law is now clear that a finding of implicit waiver requires a party to have put legal advice or its understanding of the law in issue by relying on legal advice to justify or explain its conduct.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 53; <EM>HMB</EM> at paras 44&ndash;47.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Secondly, the passage from Mr. de Vries' 2014 journal article, which the chambers judge placed considerable weight on, should not be taken as authoritative. In his article, Mr. de Vries, argues that the time period over which privilege is waived should include the pleaded discovery date.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 80, AR, Tab 16, at pp. 171-172; de Vries at 252.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Neither of the two Ontario Superior Court of Justice decisions Mr. de Vries relied on for this point, however, actually support this proposition. In <CASEREF><SOC>Davenport v. Roughley Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, the period of time over which Master Beaudoin found that privilege had been waived went up to, but did not include, the earliest possible pleaded triggering date for the start of the limitation period (although the applicant had not requested that it extend further).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Davenport v. Roughley Estate</SOC><CITE>2003 CarswellOnt 766</CITE><COURTJUR>SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras 2 and 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC></CASEREF>, it is unclear from Master Hawkins short endorsement whether the period of waiver deriving from the postponement pleading included the pleaded discovery date of June 6, 2005.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC><CITE>2009 CanLII 58602</CITE><COURTJUR>SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Lawless</EM>&rdquo;) at paras 7-8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Master Hawkins' conclusion was that the waiver of privilege on this basis extended &ldquo;until June 2005&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lawless</EM> at para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. Not only is Mr. de Vries' argument not supported by this case law, his comments appear directed at situations where the plaintiff was represented before the pleaded discovery date, as he argues that &ldquo;[w]hen a plaintiff has access to a lawyer prior to the alleged discovery of a claim, the lawyer's possible role in the discovery of that claim cannot be ignored.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>de Vries at 230.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This plainly distinguishes the circumstances here, where the plaintiffs plead that that they did not have access to a Canadian lawyer prior to the earliest possible discovery date. Since the plaintiffs do not rely on a change in legal advice or in their legal counsel's knowledge, there can be no concern that preventing Nevsun from accessing privileged communications arising out of the first meeting with counsel leads to any unfair advantage for the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>45. Third, neither of the British Columbia cases the chambers judge relied where the period of waiver included the pleaded discovery date stand for the proposition that a pleading of postponement necessarily leads to a waiver of privilege over the first alleged date of discovery of the claim. Neither case expressly considers the issue and both are clearly distinguishable from the circumstances here.</P>
<P>46. In <CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF>, the plaintiffs' alleged that they did not receive <UNDER>&ldquo;appropriate legal advice</UNDER> or a sufficient measure of certainty as to the reasonable prospect of success&rdquo; (emphasis added) until roughly 29 years after the act giving rise to the claim occurred.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2001 BCSC 1566</CITE><PARANUM>3, 10-11</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Yet, they had received legal advice about transactions similar to the subject matter of the litigation during that timespan. The plaintiffs in <EM>Harry</EM> had therefore expressly relied on the on the &ldquo;appropriateness&rdquo; of the legal advice they received on or after the earliest pled discovery date. This is not the case here, where the plaintiffs do not plead that their claims became discoverable once they received a certain quality of legal advice. Instead, they plead that they were unable to bring their claims until they had <UNDER>access</UNDER> to any type of legal advice from a Canadian lawyer at all.</P>
<P>47. Further, a key factor in <EM>Harry</EM> is that in response to the plaintiffs' plea that the <EM>Limitation Act</EM> did not apply, the defendants had raised the equitable defence of laches, meaning that the reasons for the plaintiffs' delay in bringing the action up to the date of filing was in issue. This point was emphasized by Justice Esson, when he concluded that &ldquo;in the particular circumstances of this case&rdquo;, including in particular the plea of laches, the chambers judge had not erred.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2002 BCCA 557</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>48. In <EM>Camosun College</EM>, Justice Affleck rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's plea that the limitation period was postponed meant that privilege over the file of the plaintiff's former lawyer was implicitly waived up to the date the notice of civil claim was filed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun College</EM> at para 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, Justice Affleck agreed with the plaintiff that the waiver of the former lawyer's file on this basis did not extend beyond the date when the plaintiff received an engineering report that it accepted started the limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun College</EM> at para 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> While the alleged discovery date was included in the period of waiver, this was the plaintiff's position. There is therefore no analysis in the case about whether the period of waiver from the postponement plea should include the pleaded discovery date.</P>
<P>49. There is no general proposition that a period of waiver flowing from a postponement claim necessarily extends up to, and includes, the alleged discovery date so that the defendant may fully explore the shift in the plaintiff's discovery of the claim. Such a rule would not align with the principles set out in <EM>HMB</EM> and <EM>Soprema</EM> as it is detached from the key question of whether the plaintiff has actually injected legal advice or its understanding of the law into the litigation through relying on legal advice to justify its conduct.</P>
<P>50. Further, such a proposition would lead to inconsistent results. In <EM>Camosun College</EM> for example, any privileged communications concerning the engineering report may or may not have occurred until days after counsel received the report. Here, what legal advice was communicated at the first meeting might vary significantly between the plaintiffs. For some, it could be that no substantive communications occurred until the second meeting. The arbitrary nature of such a result demonstrates that there is no special rule for waiver of privilege flowing from a postponement plea that grants defendants access to privileged communications occurring on the pleaded discovery date. Instead, the principled approach set out by this Court applies&mdash;waiver of privilege requires a party to have placed legal advice in issue by relying on that advice as justification for its conduct.</P>
<P>51. As the reply pleadings do not place the legal advice that may have been communicated at the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel in issue, it follows that the chambers judge erred in declaring that the plaintiffs had waived privilege over their first meetings with Canadian counsel.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>2)</EM></N><TI><EM>Alternatively, the Declaration of Waiver is Overly Broad</EM></TI>
<P>52. Even if this Court concludes that the reply pleadings result in an implicit waiver of privilege, the chambers judge nevertheless erred in granting an overly broad declaration not limited to the subject of postponement. By granting a declaration of waiver over all aspects of the plaintiffs' cases up to and including their first meetings with Canadian counsel, the order below extends the scope of the waiver beyond what is relevant to the issue of whether the plaintiffs knew or should have known earlier that a lawsuit against Nevsun would be an appropriate means to seek a remedy for their injuries. In doing so, the order under appeal does not &ldquo;give effect to the near absolute protection of solicitor-client privilege.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at para 48.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. It is well-established that solicitor-client privilege&mdash;a substantive rule of law&mdash;must only be interfered with to the extent absolutely necessary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Goodis v.

<P>54. Waiver over a discrete issue will not generally lead to waiver over every aspect of the litigation. In <CASEREF><SOC>Souter v. 375561 B.C. Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Goldie confirmed that where privilege over one topic has been implicitly waived, the waiver does not extend to all purposes relevant to the issues in dispute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Souter v. 375561 B.C. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1995 CanLII 83</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Souter</EM>&rdquo;) at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, the waiver in that case only extended to the subject of the waiver, which concerned whether the party's lawyer was responsible for a mistake in an affidavit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Souter</EM> at paras 21, 24-25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>McDonnell v. Langret Investments, S.A.</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Cumming concluded that an appellant's affidavit evidence that his former counsel was to blame for his failure to attend a hearing led to a waiver of privilege over the communications referenced in the affidavit but did not extend any further.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>McDonnell v. Langret Investments</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 6486</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In other words, the waiver only extended to those privileged communications the appellant specifically relied on.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Brown v. Clark Wilson LLP</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 185</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. Limiting the scope of the waiver of privilege to the specific subject matter of the waiver is also consistent with Justice Harris's conclusion in <EM>Soprema</EM> that solicitor-client privilege must only yield in clearly defined and limited circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Waiver over one issue in the litigation (discoverability) should not lead to waiver over every other issue.</P>
<P>56. Here, if there was a waiver of privilege flowing from the reply pleadings, the subject matter of the waiver cannot be broader than communications relating to whether the claims were discoverable before the plaintiffs met Canadian counsel. Any other privileged communications between counsel and the plaintiffs are irrelevant to Nevsun's ability to test the plaintiffs' pleadings that the claims were not discoverable until they had access to Canadian counsel.</P>
<P>57. If the reply pleadings implicitly waive privilege, the waiver should be limited to communications regarding whether the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known prior to meeting Canadian counsel that an action against Nevsun in Canada would be appropriate. The disclosure of communications that are not relevant to this question cannot possibly be necessary to ensure fairness between the parties or meet the requirement that privileged communication only be disclosed where &ldquo;absolutely necessary&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> at para 50.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><EM>3)</EM></N><TI><EM>The Reasons Fail to Consider Litigation Privilege</EM></TI>
<P>58. In addition to the chambers judge's errors concerning his declaration that the plaintiffs had waived solicitor-client privilege, he also erred in ordering the production of documents relating to the retainer of Ms. Chyrum.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>a)</N><TI><UNDER>The Details of Ms. Chyrum's Retainer are Protected by Litigation Privilege</UNDER></TI>
<P>59.

<P>60. The purpose of litigation privilege is to create a zone of privacy over a litigant's preparation of a case for trial. The privilege is &ldquo;based upon the need for a protected area to facilitate investigation and preparation of a case for trial by the adversarial advocate.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 SCC 39</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Blank</EM>&rdquo;), at para 28, citing R.J.

Khosravi</SOC><CITE>2015 BCCA 49</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. Litigation privilege is a class privilege, meaning that communications created for the dominant purpose of litigation that is pending or reasonably apprehended are presumptively protected from disclosure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 52</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Lizotte</EM>&rdquo;) at para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no obligation on the party asserting privilege to prove that the privilege should apply based on a case-by-case balancing of the competing interests at stake.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Lizotte</EM> at paras 37&ndash;39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. The privilege covers communications between counsel and third parties, including non-confidential information received from third parties in the course of counsel's work preparing for trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Blank</EM> at paras 27 and 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instructions or communications passed to third parties, such as potential experts or consultants, are protected by the privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Sopinka</EM> at 14.223.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Although the Rules of Court provide for the limited lifting of privilege when an expert report is to be tendered as evidence,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, R. 11-6(8) (b).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the default is that litigation privilege applies to communications with third party for the dominant purpose of pending or apprehended litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Blank</EM> at para 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>63. Retainer agreements with third party agents of litigation counsel clearly meet the test for the presumptive application of privilege. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Re Gault Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench found that the terms one party's engagement of an accountant for the purpose of considering potential litigation was litigation privileged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gault Estate (Re)</SOC><CITE>2016 ABQB 53</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Alberta Court of Appeal upheld this finding, reasoning that &ldquo;any communications with the accountant with a view to obtaining his professional assistance&rdquo; in contemplation of the litigation were privileged so long as the dominant purpose of the communications was to prepare for litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gault Estate v.

Knowles</SOC><CITE>2009 CanLII 12116</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. Here, the chambers judge ordered the plaintiffs to disclose the particulars of their counsel's retainer of a third party for the purposes of the litigation. These communications are clearly covered by litigation privilege.</P>
<P>65. Yet, the extent of the chambers judge's consideration of litigation privilege is a passing reference to its well-established nature and importance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 71, AR, Tab 16, p. 170.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no analysis or consideration of litigation privilege and whether it might apply to communications involving Ms. Chyrum or to the terms of her engagement by legal counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at paras 83-84, 101&ndash;111, AR, Tab 16, pp. 176-177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, the reasons focus on the principles that apply when determining when communications with a third party are covered by solicitor-client privilege.</P>
<P>66. The lack of consideration of litigation privilege is demonstrated by the chambers judge's discussion of &ldquo;third party privilege&rdquo;. That discussion ignores the role that litigation privilege, in addition to solicitor-client privilege, plays in protecting communications between parties and third parties from disclosure. Notably, in <CASEREF><SOC>Bank of Montreal v. Toratora</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bank of Montreal v. Tortora</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 1430</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Tortora</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the case which the chambers judge relied on for articulation of the general principles regarding third party privilege, a claim of litigation privilege over the same documents had previously failed and was not at issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Tortora</EM> at paras 5&ndash;7; <CASEREF><SOC>Bank of Montreal v. Tortora</SOC><CITE>2009 BCSC 1224</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>; see also <CASEREF><SOC>Bank of Montreal v. Tortora</SOC><CITE>2009 BCSC 1512</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF>, where Mr. Justice Butler (as he then was) found that the plaintiff still had an opportunity to assert solicitor-client privilege over some of the documents, despite the claim of litigation privilege having failed.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There was therefore no question in that case about whether the communications were privileged on any basis other than solicitor-client privilege.</P>
<P>67. This is not a case where the plaintiffs failed to claim privilege when they should have done so. Rather, the plaintiffs were not given an opportunity to establish privilege over the terms of Ms. Chyrum's retainer, since Nevsun had not requested this relief in its notice of application or applied for it at the hearing. This fundamental unfairness deprived the plaintiffs of an opportunity to establish litigation privilege over the terms of their counsel's retainer of a third party engaged for the purposes of the litigation. For these reasons, this order must be overturned.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>Ms. Chyrum's Retainer Does Not Assist in Determining Which Communications Are Litigation Privileged</UNDER></TI>
<P>68. Further, the chambers judge's failure to consider and apply the principles of litigation privilege also led to his erroneous conclusion that the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer would be helpful to determining which of the plaintiffs' communications with Ms. Chyrum ought to be produced.</P>
<P>69. In ordering production of the retainer on the basis that it &ldquo;may well assist in delineating Ms. Chyrum's precise role while acting as a third party agent for counsel&rdquo;,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 109, AR, Tab 16, p. 177.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the chambers judge failed to consider that litigation privilege may also apply to these communications and make this inquiry unnecessary. While solicitor-client privilege only extends to communications involving third parties when the function of the third party is essential to the solicitor-client relationship,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Tortora</EM> at para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> litigation privilege does not include this limitation. It applies to plaintiff-third party communications so long as the dominant purpose of the communications was to prepare for litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gichuru v. British Columbia (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 259</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no requirement that the third party plays an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; function in the lawyer-client relationship.</P>
<P>70. So long as the communications between Ms. Chyrum and the plaintiffs are for the dominant purpose of the litigation, it is unnecessary to examine the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's role any further. The plaintiffs' evidence is that their counsel is producing communications between Ms. Chyrum and the plaintiffs where the dominant purpose was not in furtherance of the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #9 at paras 3, 5, 10, AB, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If it wishes, Nevsun can challenge the plaintiffs' privilege list through the ordinary procedure of challenging the designation of particular documents. There is no need for Nevsun to explore the exact nature of Ms. Chyrum's engagement generally.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>c)</N><TI><UNDER>The Allegations of Bias Are Irrelevant in the Context of this Application</UNDER></TI>
<P>71. Finally, the chambers judge's finding that disclosure of the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer may be &ldquo;material to any potential allegations of bias arising from her translator and interpreter functions&rdquo; is not grounded in the context of this application. None of Ms. Chyrum's translations were at issue below. Nor did Nevsun seek to have the Court revisit its 2016 decision that certain affidavits translated by Ms. Chyrum were admissible.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya 2016</EM> at paras 216-217.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> If Nevsun wishes to challenge the objectivity of an affidavit translated by Ms. Chyrum, it should do so in the context of a particular affidavit, not as vague and generalized assertions of impropriety not tied to any particular piece of evidence.</P>
<P>72. Even accepting Nevsun's generalized approach, it is difficult to see how the information that Ms. Chyrum acts as an agent to communicate to clients calls into question the objectivity of her translations. In <CASEREF><SOC>Luu v. Wang</SOC></CASEREF>, the objectivity of the translation was questioned because the interpreter was the wife or ex-wife of the defendant and the daughter of the affiant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Luu v. Wang</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 1201</CITE><PARANUM>2-3</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The focus is on whether a relationships between the party and the translator suggests a lack of objectivity. An employment or agency relationship between counsel and the interpreter is wholly different.</P>
<P>73. These vague assertions of bias should not entitle Nevsun to trench into the plaintiffs' protected zone of litigation privilege. Nevsun's speculation that Ms. Chyrum's translations may lack impartiality is no less speculative than it was in 2016.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Araya 2016</EM> at para 216.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. Overall, the chambers judge's reasons indicate that he erred by failing to consider or apply the principles of litigation privilege. Because Nevsun did not request the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer in its notice of application, the plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to establish that these communications are privileged, which they clearly are. In any event, the particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer are unnecessary to determine the issues raised in the underlying application. The third ground of appeal should be allowed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="VI">PART 4&mdash;NATURE OF ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>75. The plaintiffs seek an order allowing the appeal and setting aside paragraphs 2&ndash;4 of the order below. Alternatively, if the Court decides that the declaration that the plaintiffs have waived privilege up to and including the date upon which each plaintiff first met Canadian counsel should stand, the plaintiffs submit that the declaration should be limited to documents and communications relating to whether the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known prior to meeting Canadian counsel that an action against Nevsun in Canada would be appropriate.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>The plaintiffs, a group that now includes approximately 80 Eritrean refugees, have sued Nevsun Resources Ltd. (&ldquo;Nevsun&rdquo;) alleging that Nevsun was party to various wrongs committed by arms of the Eritrean government at the Bisha mine between 2006 and 2014. Ten actions have been commenced over the last four years. Among other things, Nevsun pleads that the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred under Eritrean law and, alternatively, under the <EM>Limitation Act</EM> (2012) or the <EM>Limitation Act</EM> (1996). In response to Nevsun's limitations defence, the plaintiffs have pleaded that the limitation period is postponed because they did not have the requisite understanding of their legal rights against Nevsun in Canada and only could have brought their claim after they had met with Canadian counsel to &ldquo;ascertain and assess&rdquo; those rights against Nevsun.</P>
<P>In the court below, the plaintiffs agreed that the plea of postponement waived privilege, but maintained that the waiver did not extend to their first meeting with counsel. The case management judge correctly found that the postponement plea waived privilege over documents and communications exchanged during the plaintiffs' first meeting with counsel. The plaintiffs' replies expressly and voluntarily assert reliance on advice from a counsel at a specific meeting as the event that led to discovery of a claim against Nevsun. Fairness demands that Nevsun be permitted to test this pleading to determine whether information about a potential claim against Nevsun was available to the plaintiffs at an earlier date. The case management judge made no error in his ruling about the scope of the waiver.</P>
<P>Ms. Chyrum has acted in several capacities in her dealings with the plaintiffs. She was reportedly retained by Canadian counsel months before any plaintiffs met counsel and before litigation could have been contemplated. The case management judge correctly ordered disclosure of her retainer agreement with Canadian counsel in order to assess the plaintiffs' claim to privilege.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Background to the Actions</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The plaintiffs claim that the Bisha mine was built using forced labour and that Nevsun is liable as an accessory to wrongs committed by various arms of the Eritrean government. The plaintiffs allege that these wrongs occurred between 2006 and 2014. Nevsun denies these allegations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appeal Record (&ldquo;AR&rdquo;), Tab 16, Reasons for Judgment of Justice Abrioux (&ldquo;Reasons&rdquo;), paras. 2&ndash;12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. The proceeding now comprises ten separate actions including more than 80 plaintiffs. Justice Abrioux was the case management judge for all actions before his elevation to this Court. The first action, <CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, was commenced on November 20, 2014 (the &ldquo;Araya Action&rdquo;). After Justice Abrioux ordered that the Araya Action could not proceed as a representative action, nine additional actions were commenced between October 19, 2016 and May 14, 2018 (the &ldquo;Related Actions&rdquo;, and with the Araya Action, the &ldquo;Actions&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, para. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. The Actions currently stand at a &ldquo;critical juncture&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2019 BCSC 262</CITE><PARANUM>10, 20-21</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Document Reasons&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs intend to apply to proceed by way of a series of test cases (the &ldquo;bellwether&rdquo; trials) later in 2019. The trial in one action, Araya, has been set as a placeholder and is presently scheduled to begin in April 2020.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The pleadings</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. In its responses to the various notices of civil claim, Nevsun pleads that the actions are statute-barred. Nevsun first pleads that Eritrean law governs these proceedings. Eritrean law imposes a limitation period and has no discoverability rules. In the alternative, Nevsun relies on British Columbia limitations legislation. The plaintiffs incorrectly state that Nevsun has relied only on the current <EM>Limitation Act</EM>, S.B.C. 2012, c. 13 (the &ldquo;<EM>New Act</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants' Factum, para. 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In fact, Nevsun's responses rely on the <EM>New Act</EM> as well as the <EM>Limitation Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 266 (the &ldquo;<EM>Old Act</EM>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 2, Response to Civil Claim filed February 13, 2015, paras. 11-12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. The plaintiffs have filed replies in each of the Actions (the &ldquo;Replies&rdquo;) responding to Nevsun's limitation defences. The case management judge observed that the Replies have evolved through the course of the litigation, but are substantially similar.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, para. 64.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs plead that there is no applicable limitation period. In the alternative, the plaintiffs say that the applicable limitation period has been postponed or tolled or both.</P>
<P>6. The plaintiffs filed the first Reply in January 2017 in the Araya Action. This pleading is different from Replies in the Related Actions. The Araya Reply pleads postponement to the date the Araya notice of civil claim was filed (November 2014).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 3, Araya Reply filed January 31, 2017, para. 1; Tab 16, Reasons, para. 65.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> During argument in the court below, plaintiffs' counsel advised he would be bringing an application to amend the Araya Reply. The waiver application in the Araya Action was adjourned to permit the plaintiffs to bring an application to amend.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 65-66, 91&ndash;95. The plaintiffs have since amended the Araya Reply to follow substantially the words used in the Common Plea. Respondent's Appeal Book, Tab 1, Amended Araya Reply filed April 25, 2019.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Replies in the Related Actions were filed between February 9, 2018 and September 7, 2018.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tabs 4&ndash;12, Replies.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Reply in the Mekonen Action is representative of the common plea of postponement (the &ldquo;Common Plea&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, para. 67.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>:
<QUOTE><P>1. In reply to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Part 3 of the defendant's Response to Civil Claim, this action is not subject to any limitation period. In the alternative, any limitation period applicable to each of the plaintiffs' claims was:
<P1>(a) postponed until at least the time when they <UNDER>accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada as against the defendant</UNDER>; and</P1></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>8. In the alternative, any limitation period applicable to each plaintiff's claims in this action was postponed until at least the time when they <UNDER>accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada as against Nevsun.</UNDER></P>
<P>9. <UNDER>The plaintiffs' claims against Nevsun involve complex and novel issues of domestic tort law and customary international law.</UNDER></P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>11. <UNDER>Prior to accessing the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada as against Nevsun,</UNDER> the plaintiffs lacked the means to discover that they <UNDER>may have a claim against it</UNDER> and that <UNDER>a court action in the courts of British Columbia was the appropriate means of seeking a remedy against Nevsun.</UNDER></P>
<P>12. Particulars of the plaintiffs' circumstances relevant to postponement of any applicable limitation period include:

<P>[Underlining added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. The Replies in the Related Actions provide details of each plaintiff's circumstances and the date on which each plaintiff first met with &ldquo;Canadian counsel&rdquo;. These dates, which range between December 2013 and February 2018, are alleged to be the dates when the plaintiffs discovered a potential claim against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g., AR, Tab 11, Mekonen Reply, para. 14(b).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>Examinations for discovery</UNDER></TI>
<P>9. Examinations for discovery of certain plaintiffs took place in the fall of 2018. During these examinations, plaintiffs' counsel objected to any questions concerning the first meeting with counsel on the on the basis of solicitor-client privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g. AAB, Tab 3, Dhanpaul #9, Ex. &ldquo;A&rdquo;, Q763.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10.

<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>Nevsun's application</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. In December 2018, Nevsun brought an application seeking an order that the plaintiffs had waived privilege over documents and communications arising from the Common Plea and an order requiring the plaintiffs to produce documents. Nevsun also sought an order declaring that no privilege attached to documents and communications with Ms. Chyrum, or, alternatively, that any privilege had been waived. Nevsun sought rulings on objections made in discovery flowing from these orders.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 13, Notice of Application (&ldquo;NOA&rdquo;), Part 1, paras. 1&ndash;3, 4, 6; Part 2, 10&ndash;13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Nevsun's motion did not seek production of specific documents because the plaintiffs did not provide lists of documents that properly listed privileged documents. Only recently have the plaintiffs agreed to provide lists of documents that comply with the rules for listing privileged documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 13, NOA, Part 2, para. 11.

<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>Reasons of case management judge</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. The case management judge confirmed that the parties &ldquo;essentially agree on the legal framework&rdquo; governing solicitor-client and litigation privilege and waiver. He correctly instructed himself that &ldquo;[t]he law has clearly recognized the importance and value of both forms of privilege, and the virtually sacrosanct status of the former.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 69&ndash;71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. There was no dispute that the plaintiffs had waived privilege: &ldquo;[t]he plaintiffs admit that, as a result of the plea of postponement, their state of mind is in issue and privilege has been waived&rdquo;. The remaining issue was the &ldquo;scope of the waiver&rdquo; and &ldquo;the facts and documents that must be disclosed&rdquo;. The plaintiffs argued that waiver did not include their first meeting with counsel because the Replies only pointed to &ldquo;access&rdquo; to Canadian legal advice. According to the plaintiffs, &ldquo;the waiver of privilege ends at the time the &lsquo;access&rsquo; commenced, which is when the meeting commenced&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 70, 85&ndash;88.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The case management judge rejected this argument. The judge emphasized the language of the Common Plea, as exemplified by the Reply in the Mekonen Action, which stated that the plaintiffs &ldquo;<EM>required</EM>&rdquo; legal advice from Canadian counsel to &ldquo;assess and ascertain&rdquo; their legal rights as against Nevsun in Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 89-90.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The case management judge reasoned that it could only be as a result of the first meeting with counsel that the plaintiffs' state of mind would have transitioned from lack of knowledge or certainty to a knowledge of &ldquo;a reasonable likelihood of success against Nevsun in a Canadian court&rdquo;. The judge ruled that by reason of the Common Plea, each of the plaintiffs had waived privilege over communications and documents relating to the pursuit of the Actions up to and including the date upon which they first met Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 90, 112, Tab 15, Order, para. 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. With respect to Ms. Chyrum, the plaintiffs agreed that communications between Ms. Chyrum and plaintiffs while she was wearing her &ldquo;activist hat&rdquo; were not privileged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, para. 106.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The case management judge found that &ldquo;the real issue is when Ms. Chyrum was acting as an assistant or agent to legal counsel, since those communications would raise the issue of third party privilege.&rdquo; Because Ms. Chyrum exercised a dual role, the case management judge ordered that her retainer be disclosed as &ldquo;[i]t may well assist in delineating Ms. Chyrum's precise role while acting as a third party agent for counsel and/or be material to any potential allegations of bias arising from her translator and interpreter functions.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 107&ndash;109, 112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ISSUES ON APPEAL</TI>
<P>18. In response to the errors asserted by the plaintiffs, Nevsun submits:
<P1>A. The case management judge did not err in concluding that the admitted waiver of privilege included the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel.</P1>
<P1>B. The case management judge did not err by making an overly broad order regarding the scope of the waiver.</P1>
<P1>C. The case management judge did not err in ordering disclosure of Ms. Chyrum's retainer.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. The parties agreed on the applicable law and the plaintiffs admitted that privilege had been waived. The narrow issue before the case management judge was whether the waiver included the plaintiffs' first meetings with counsel. The plaintiffs' pleadings explicitly rely on legal advice conveyed at those first meetings. Nevsun cannot test the claim of postponement without knowing what was communicated to the plaintiffs at those meetings. Fairness requires that Nevsun be permitted to investigate whether the information provided at those first meetings was or could have been available to the plaintiffs at an earlier date. The case management judge made no error in ruling that the plaintiffs' waiver of privilege included the first meetings with counsel.</P>
<P>20. Similarly, in light of the fact that Ms. Chyrum has acted in different roles in her dealings with the plaintiffs, disclosure of her retainer is required to assess the plaintiffs' claim that communications with her are protected by litigation privilege. The case management judge correctly ruled that her retainer should be disclosed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Standard of review</UNDER></TI>
<P>21. This Court has said that whether a judge correctly identified and applied the test governing waiver of privilege is a question of law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 471</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Soprema</EM>&rdquo;); <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 263</CITE><PARANUM>29</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>HMB</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here, there was no dispute in the court below about the principles of law governing waiver of privilege arising out of a plea of postponement. The plaintiffs admitted there was a waiver of privilege. The only issue was the <EM>extent</EM> of that waiver. No question of law arises.</P>
<P>22. Other decisions of this Court state that whether privilege is waived is a question of mixed fact and law, reviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error, unless an extricable question of law is identified.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mayer v. Mayer</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 77</CITE><PARANUM>188</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Do Process LP v. Infokey Software Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 BCCA 52</CITE><PARANUM>16&ndash;20</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Do Process</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The case management judge made no extricable error of law. The scope of the admitted waiver of privilege was based on the case management judge's assessment of the pleadings in light of his knowledge of the history of the litigation.</P>
<P>23. The plaintiffs' appeal from the order to disclose Ms. Chyrum's retainer similarly raises no extricable question of law. The order turned on the judge's assessment of evidence and his determination of the proper scope of disclosure in the course of ongoing case management.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Shooting Star Amusements Ltd. v. Prince George Agricultural and Historical Association</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 452</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM><DECIDER>Newbury J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Shooting Star</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. Even if this Court decides that this appeal raises questions of law, the case management judge's decisions were correct and should not be disturbed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>The Plaintiffs' Common Plea relies on legal advice and waives privilege</UNDER></TI>
<P>25. The Common Plea explicitly relies on legal advice as the essential element of the claimed postponement.</P>
<P>26. The Common Plea relies on two elements to achieve postponement of the limitation period. First, the Common Plea asserts that the plaintiffs did not and could not obtain legal advice on their rights against Nevsun. They were in a position of ignorance about their legal rights, which stopped them from bringing a claim at an earlier time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 11, Mekonen Reply, para. 11. See <CASEREF><SOC>07822484 B.C. Ltd. v. E-Pro Enterprises Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCSC 2245</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>E-Pro</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, the Common Plea asserts that the plaintiffs obtained legal advice during a particular meeting with Canadian counsel, at which time they &ldquo;ascertained and assessed&rdquo; their legal rights to bring a claim against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 11, Mekonen Reply, para. 14(b).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs made a deliberate and voluntary election to identify the receipt of legal advice as the event that led to discovery of their claims.</P>
<P>27. The operative words here are &ldquo;ascertain and assess&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;assess&rdquo; means to &ldquo;judge or evaluate&rdquo;; the word &ldquo;ascertain&rdquo; means &ldquo;to find out as a definitive fact&rdquo; and &ldquo;achieve certainty&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</EM>, 2d ed., Oxford University Press: 2004, <EM>sub verbo</EM> &ldquo;assess&rdquo;; <CASEREF><SOC>Schmidt v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2016 FC 269</CITE><PARANUM>131</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2018 FCA 55</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The combined effect of these word choices is to confirm the plaintiffs' consideration of information leading to a conclusion or a result (an awareness of a claim, which starts the limitation period).</P>
<P>28. The plaintiffs' position that their postponement plea does not import reliance on legal advice, because they rely only on &ldquo;access&rdquo; to Canadian lawyers as the &ldquo;pleaded precursor&rdquo; to postponement, ignores the plain language of the Common Plea. The Common Plea does not only speak of &ldquo;access&rdquo; to a Canadian lawyer who might be available to represent them. Instead, the Common Plea specifically invokes the &ldquo;legal advice of Canadian counsel <UNDER>necessary</UNDER> to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada as against the defendant&rdquo;. The Common Plea makes the legal advice received in the first meeting a condition of the knowledge required for discoverability: the plea is that &ldquo;<UNDER>[p]rior to</UNDER> assessing legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights&rdquo; no claim could be brought. Further, without this advice the plaintiffs could not know a Canadian court action was &ldquo;the appropriate means to obtain a remedy against Nevsun.&rdquo; Legal advice is an essential element of the postponement claim.</P>
<P>29. The plaintiffs voluntarily elected to rely on the legal advice provided during the first meeting with Canadian counsel. They did not have to do this. It was open to plead, for example, that their claims were postponed due to challenging personal circumstances. Instead, they pointed to legal advice received in their first meeting as the triggering event to answer a limitation defence.</P>
<P>30. For this reason, the plaintiffs incorrectly object that the case management judge made a &ldquo;speculative leap&rdquo; that communications at the first meeting were relevant to assessing the plaintiffs' pleas of postponement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants' Factum, paras. 31-32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No &ldquo;speculative leap&rdquo; or assumption is required. The relevance of those communications is evident on the plaintiffs' own pleadings. The actual substance of the advice need not be set out in the pleading.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Adam Dodek, <EM>Solicitor-Client Privilege</EM> (Toronto: Lexis Nexis, 2014) at 7.111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. The fact that the plaintiffs have admitted that the limitations clock starts running from the time of the first meeting does not permit them to control the scope of their waiver of privilege. This Court has rejected the plaintiffs' underlying theory in this appeal that anything that occurred during the running of the limitation period is irrelevant to the question of discoverability.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2002 BCCA 557</CITE><PARANUM>12&ndash;15</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Harry BCCA</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. On any analysis, the Common Plea amounts to a voluntary reliance on legal advice, obtained at the first meeting with counsel, as a material element of the plea of postponement.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>There is no dispute on the law that a postponement plea waives privilege</UNDER></TI>
<P>33. The case management judge was cognizant of the sacrosanct nature of solicitor-client privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR Tab 16, Reasons, para. 71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It was not in dispute, however, that a plea of postponement results in waiver of privilege because it puts at issue a party's state of mind. The plaintiffs admitted that &ldquo;as a result of the plea of postponement, their state of mind is in issue and privilege has been waived&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR Tab 16, Reasons, para. 70.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. The case management judge correctly relied on the two leading cases dealing with postponement and waiver: <CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2001 BCSC 1566</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Harry BCSC</EM>&rdquo;), affirmed, <EM>Harry BCCA</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and <CASEREF><SOC>Camosun College v.

Levelton Engineering Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 1190</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Camosun</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. In <EM>Harry</EM>, Justice Vickers held that the plaintiffs had waived privilege over information and legal advice received up to the date they initiated proceedings. In that case, the plaintiff band commenced action against British Columbia and Canada in 1994. The defendants raised limitation defences and laches. The plaintiffs pleaded that they did not discover the claims until February 1993 when they received information from Canada and obtained legal advice. Justice Vickers held that the plea of postponement entitled the defendants to examine privileged communications:
<QUOTE><P>[19] The plaintiffs plead they couldn't have commenced proceedings at an earlier date because they lacked sufficient information. They say that information came to them sometime after February 1993. Those pleas constitute a waiver of privilege. <UNDER>The defendants are entitled to inquire into the knowledge acquired by the plaintiffs to test whether it might reasonably have been available at some earlier date or whether indeed it was information already in their possession from an earlier date</UNDER>. [Underlining added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>36. On appeal, the plaintiffs agreed privilege was waived before February 1993, but refused to disclose information including and after that date. This Court upheld the judgment of Justice Vickers.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Harry BCCA</EM>, paras. 7, 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. <EM>Camosun</EM> follows <EM>Harry</EM> and confirms that a plea of postponement puts at issue a plaintiffs legal knowledge because to successfully claim postponement, &ldquo;it must be established that the party lacked the factual and legal knowledge necessary to start the action prior to the date in which it was actually commenced&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun</EM>, para. 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In that case, the Court agreed there had been a waiver of privilege up to and including the alleged day of discovery of the claim, which had been based on receipt of an expert report.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun</EM>, paras. 36, 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The article by Mr. de Vries, referenced by the case management judge, is consistent with the British Columbia judgments on postponement and waiver. Mr. de Vries correctly observes that the plaintiff has the exclusive power to identify the terms of the purported discovery date and the period of postponement. Given this power, the date of discovery selected by the plaintiff, whether by pleading or other representation, should be included in the waiver so that the defendant may test the assertion that the claim was not otherwise discoverable.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jonathan de Vries, &ldquo;Privilege and Limitations: The Impact of Raising the Discoverability of Claims on Solicitor-Client Privilege&rdquo;, (2014) 43 Advocates Quarterly 219&ndash;256 at 251&ndash;253 (&ldquo;de Vries&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is the same point made by Justice Vickers in <EM>Harry</EM> and endorsed by this Court: the defendant should be allowed to test whether the plaintiff could have discovered the claim at an earlier time.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Harry BCSC</EM>, para. 19. See also <EM>E-Pro</EM>, para. 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. In this case, as the case management judge found, it could only be as a result of information conveyed at the first meeting with counsel that the plaintiffs' &ldquo;state of mind would have transitioned&rdquo; to the knowledge of a reasonable likelihood of success in a Canadian court&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>de Vries at 252; <EM>Harry BCSC</EM>, para. 15; Dodek at 7.112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Waiver of privilege must include the first meeting with counsel.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>Legal advice material to the postponement plea under B.C. limitations legislation</UNDER></TI>
<P>40. Even if the plaintiffs had not expressly pleaded reliance on legal advice, the receipt of legal advice would be relevant to a plea of postponement under B.C. limitations legislation.</P>
<P>41. Under the <EM>Old Act</EM>, the receipt of &ldquo;appropriate advice&rdquo; including &ldquo;legal advice&rdquo; is an element of the test for postponement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Brooks v. Jackson</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 150</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Wirtanen v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>1994 CanLII 1109</CITE><COURTJUR>BCSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. Under s. 8 of the <EM>New Act</EM>, a claim is not discoverable until a plaintiff &ldquo;knew or reasonably ought to have known&rdquo; that, among other things, &ldquo;a court proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy&rdquo; the claimed injury. In order to satisfy this criterion, the Common Plea explicitly identifies legal advice as the element that allowed the plaintiffs to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada&rdquo;.</P>
<P>43. Whether the <EM>Old Act</EM> or the <EM>New Act</EM> applies (or whether Eritrean law applies) has not been determined. That is a matter for trial. Under either statute, and on these pleadings, the information conveyed at the first meeting with counsel is material.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI><UNDER>Implied waiver cases relied on by the plaintiffs do not alter the law concerning postponement</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. The cases on which the plaintiffs rely do not deal with waiver of privilege effected by a plea of postponement. These cases do not alter the fact that the plaintiffs' pleadings expressly assert that Canadian legal advice was the element that led the plaintiffs to discover a potential claim against Nevsun.</P>
<P>45. In <EM>Soprema</EM>, the plaintiff sued in negligent misrepresentation. Critically, the plaintiff never pleaded or otherwise referred to legal advice it received. It had not &ldquo;<UNDER>voluntarily</UNDER> made its understanding of its legal position a material issue in the litigation&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM>, para, 6. [Emphasis added.]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> But legal advice may still have been relevant to its &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; on the question of reasonable reliance. This Court ruled that a party must voluntarily inject legal advice it received or its understanding of the law before waiver is implied. A bare plea of misrepresentation was not enough.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM>, paras. 49, 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. In <EM>HMB</EM>, &ldquo;HMB did not plead that at it had relied on solicitors' advice to explain its conduct. The affidavit filed in support of its position did not assert reliance on solicitors' advice in defending its position.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM>, para. 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In those circumstances, this Court held that the judge erred in inferring that legal advice must have been relevant and relied upon.</P>
<P>47. In short, <EM>Soprema</EM> clarified the specific issue of implied waiver in cases where the cause of action advanced, as opposed to any conduct on the part of a plaintiff, brings into issue the plaintiff's state of mind and its reliance on a representation. <EM>HMB</EM> follows this law. But neither case changes the law of implied waiver more broadly.</P>
<P>48. The plaintiffs' reliance on <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM> also overlooks the fact that they admitted in the court below that privilege had been waived by their plea of postponement. The only issue was the scope of that waiver.</P>
<P>49. The decisions that deal with postponement, <EM>Camosun</EM> and <EM>Harry</EM>, are consistent with other judgments dealing with implied waiver of privilege based on reliance on legal advice. In <CASEREF><SOC>S. &amp; K. Processors Ltd. v. Campbell Ave. Herring Producers Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF>, for example, Justice McLachlin (then in the Supreme Court of British Columbia) agreed that &ldquo;where a litigant relies on legal advice as an element of his claim or defence, the privilege which would otherwise attach to that advice is lost.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>S. &amp; K.

K.</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. In any case, the Common Plea satisfies the three-part test the plaintiffs say emerges from <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM> and subsequent cases from the Supreme Court of British Columbia. First, a plea of postponement or discoverability puts in issue the plaintiffs' mind. Second, the Common Plea expressly states that the plaintiffs received legal advice relating to their rights in Canada against Nevsun. Third, and most importantly, the plaintiffs rely on that legal advice as the event that took them from a state of ignorance to a state of knowledge about their legal rights, including that &ldquo;a court action in the courts of British Columbia was the appropriate means of seeking a remedy against Nevsun&rdquo;. The plaintiffs volunteered this information to obtain the benefit of postponement so that their claim against Nevsun would not be statute-barred. They cannot avoid the consequences of that decision.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI><UNDER>Fairness requires disclosure to test the validity of the claim of postponement</UNDER></TI>
<P>51. The plaintiffs seek to shield the very information they say postponed their claim against Nevsun, including critical facts and advice they say were important to their ability to bring a claim against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>S. &amp; K.</EM>, para. 6; <EM>E-Pro</EM>, paras. 28, 39; <EM>Camosun</EM>, para. 19; <CASEREF><SOC>Souter v. 375561 B.C.

No. 2265</CITE><PARANUM>22</PARANUM><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Without knowing what information was exchanged at the first meeting, Nevsun has no means to test the postponement plea or to investigate what information or advice was available to the plaintiffs at earlier dates. Nevsun should be permitted to inquire into the legal knowledge acquired by the plaintiffs to test whether they could have obtained it earlier, or whether they in fact had such knowledge earlier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Harry BCSC</EM>, para. 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. Fairness and consistency require that the defendant be permitted to explore the validity of the postponement plea:
<QUOTE><P>[T]here is always some manifestation of a <UNDER>voluntary intention</UNDER> to waive the privilege <UNDER>at least to a limited extent</UNDER>. The law then says that in fairness and consistency, it must be entirely waived. ... the plaintiff chose to raise the issue. <UNDER>Having raised it, he could not in fairness be permitted to use privilege to prevent his opponent exploring its validity</UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>S. &amp; K.</EM>, para. 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [Underlining added.]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>53. It is particularly important for Nevsun to be permitted to test the validity of postponement claims because of the number of actions, the number of plaintiffs, and the number of alleged meetings with counsel. In ten actions, commenced over several years, approximately 80 plaintiffs make almost identical postponement pleas relying on legal advice obtained in different meetings between 2013 and 2018. Without knowing what occurred at these meetings, Nevsun cannot know whether it would have been possible for the plaintiffs to have obtained similar information through other sources, including Ms. Chyrum, other plaintiffs, other lawyers, family members or various media.</P>
<P>54. The case management judge was alive to the unfairness and inconsistency arising from the maintenance of the privilege in these circumstances. His decision that the plaintiffs' waiver includes information from the first meeting reveals no error of fact or law in the exercise of his discretion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Dodek at 7.113-7.114, citing <CASEREF><SOC>R. v.

<BLOCK2><N>H.</N><TI><UNDER>The scope of the waiver is not overly broad</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The case management judge's decision is founded on the language of the plaintiffs' own pleadings. They chose to put into issue the legal advice they received. Given the language of the Common Plea, the plaintiffs cannot now limit the communications and documents subject to disclosure as a result of the waiver.</P>
<P>56. The plaintiffs say that the scope of the order extends beyond the relevant &ldquo;subject matter&rdquo;. They submit that the only &ldquo;subject matter&rdquo; that is relevant is &ldquo;whether the claims were discoverable before the plaintiffs met Canadian counsel&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Appellants' Factum, para. 56.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs' attempt to limit the scope of the waiver is inconsistent with their admission that the waiver included everything preceding the first meeting with counsel and with the open-ended words used in the Common Plea.</P>
<P>57. Having pleaded reliance on advice imparted at a meeting with counsel as the basis for postponement and deliberately casting the net of that pleading broadly, the plaintiffs cannot now seek to limit disclosure to those communications that they say relate only to the discrete issue of postponement. It would be impractical to attempt to disentangle the information exchanged at that meetings in order to isolate those communications the plaintiffs say are relevant to postponement alone. It is unrealistic to expect that communications between the plaintiffs and their counsel could be unravelled in this way. Where privilege is waived, the scope of production includes &ldquo;any communication that has a relevant and material connection to the issue&rdquo;; the privilege is &ldquo;lost with respect to all communications on that topic, not just the ones that [the party] selects for disclosure.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Transportation Lease Systems Inc. v. Virdi</SOC><CITE>2007 BCSC 132</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This includes any communication between solicitor and client regarding the subject matter of the legal advice, including background facts and communications necessary to put that advice into context.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>578115 Ontario Inc. v.

J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The plaintiffs' attempt to narrow the scope of the waiver to advice about postponement is contrary to the language of the Common Plea itself. This narrow approach would also give the plaintiffs the unilateral power to select what information to disclose. On the plaintiffs' theory, they would disclose only communications that relate to postponement of the limitation period. They would not have to disclose any other information that ostensibly led the plaintiffs to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; claims against Nevsun. This would prevent Nevsun from exploring whether any of that information was available to the plaintiffs at an earlier date.</P>
<P>59. The plaintiffs' approach is also contrary to the case management judge's objective of providing the parties with guidance going forward. This Court should not override the case management judge's assessment of what fairness and consistency require in the circumstances. The scope of the waiver ordered by the case management judge is consistent with the pleadings and demonstrates no error.</P>
<P>60. The plaintiffs also argue that the scope of the order is too broad because it is unmoored to the discovery process. With respect, Nevsun's application was necessarily general because (a) the plaintiffs had failed to produce lists of documents that included a proper listing of documents over which privilege had been claimed; and (a) on examinations for discovery of the plaintiffs, their counsel objected broadly to questions about discovery of their claims including meetings with Canadian counsel. The case management judge made his orders to provide guidance going forward.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 16, Reasons, paras. 110-111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. The case management judge's interlocutory rulings do not compromise trial fairness. Whether the information produced by the plaintiffs as a result of these orders is ultimately admitted at trial is for the trial judge to determine.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Do Process</EM>, para. 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the meantime, Nevsun should be permitted to investigate the plaintiffs' postponement claims.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>I.</N><TI><UNDER>The plaintiffs failed to establish that Ms. Chyrum's retainer is covered by litigation privilege</UNDER></TI>
<P>62. The case management judge made no error in ordering production of particulars of Ms. Chyrum's retainer. The plaintiffs failed to adduce sufficient evidence to establish such information was or could be subject to litigation privilege.</P>
<P>63. Litigation privilege is a limited exception to the principle of full disclosure. It is not an equal partner of the broadly interpreted solicitor-client privilege. More information is required to justify the invocation litigation privilege than for solicitor-client privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gichuru v. British Columbia (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 259</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Gichuru</EM>&rdquo;), and cases cited therein.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. An agreement between counsel and a third party may be subject to litigation privilege in some cases. However, the question is whether the party asserting the privilege can satisfy the test for litigation privilege in connection with a particular document. A party asserting litigation privilege over a particular document has the burden to show that (1) litigation was ongoing or was reasonably contemplated &ldquo;at the time the document was created&rdquo;; and (2) the dominant purpose of creating the document was to prepare for that litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gichuru</EM>, para. 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. Litigation privilege belongs to the litigant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 SCC 39</CITE><PARANUM>32</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Mask v.

<P>66. The plaintiffs here failed to establish that litigation privilege applied to Ms. Chyrum's retainer. In response to Nevsun's application for a ruling on objections relating to Ms. Chyrum, plaintiffs' counsel provided an unfiled affidavit which stated (for the first time in this litigation) that Ms. Chyrum had been an agent of counsel since May 1, 2013, who recruited and communicated with witnesses and clients.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AAB, Tab 4, Lascaris Affidavit, para. 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No other evidence was proffered about Ms. Chyrum's circumstances. In particular, there was no evidence from any plaintiff.</P>
<P>67. Litigation privilege cannot attach to Ms. Chyrum's retainer because, on the plaintiffs' own pleadings, no plaintiff had retained or even met with counsel in May of 2013. The plaintiffs in the Araya Action say they first met counsel in early December 2013. The next meeting took place in June 2014, and continuing thereafter. Litigation could not have been in contemplation at the time of Ms. Chyrum's retainer because there were no clients to contemplate litigation.</P>
<P>68. In addition, the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient information to establish that Ms. Chyrum's retainer is covered by the privilege. There was insufficient evidence to establish that the retainer's dominant purpose was to prepare for litigation given Ms. Chyrum's multiple, overlapping roles before and during this litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gichuru</EM>, paras. 31-32. See also e.g. <CASEREF><SOC>Kitsul v. Slater Vecchio LLP</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 1394</CITE><PARANUM>40</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>69. The decision to order disclosure or Ms. Chyrum's retainer is not unfair. In the first place, Nevsun raised the issue of the privilege attaching to communications and documents with Ms. Chyrum and the plaintiffs. It sought rulings on objections made on discovery, including objections in which litigation privilege was claimed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AR, Tab 13, NOA, Part 1, paras. 4, 6; Part 3, 14, 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Second, the plaintiffs agreed that privilege had been waived over communications and documents before the first meeting with counsel as a result of pleading postponement. The case management judge correctly recognized that his ruling would resolve many requests and objections regarding the plaintiffs' dealings with Ms. Chyrum. Third, Nevsun had raised the issue of Ms. Chyrum's multiple roles in the litigation. The plaintiffs were well aware that Ms. Chyrum's status was in issue.</P>
<P>70. Given Ms. Chyrum's fluid roles in this case, disclosure of the retainer is necessary to help delineate the capacity in which she may have been acting when communicating with the plaintiffs. The case management judge's decision to order production of information related to Ms. Chyrum's retainer was a reasonable exercise of his discretion as a case management judge regarding disclosure of documents.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>J.</N><TI><UNDER>Conclusion</UNDER></TI>
<P>71. The case management judge did not err in finding that the plaintiffs admitted waiver of privilege included documents and communications exchanged in the first meeting with counsel. No other conclusion is possible on a plain reading of the Common Plea. The decision is in keeping with established principles concerning postponement and waiver of privilege. The case management judge did not err in ordering disclosure of Ms. Chyrum's retainer.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Nevsun Attempts to Recast the Evidence and the Pleadings</EM></TI>
<P>1. Throughout its factum, Nevsun attempts to recast the plaintiffs' pleadings in order to make the case that the plaintiffs' pleadings rely on legal advice, a conclusion the chambers judge never drew himself.</P>
<P>2. At paragraph 28 of its factum, Nevsun's (unattributed) quotation of the plaintiffs' reply pleadings erroneously quotes the reply as stating that &ldquo;[p]rior to assessing legal advice...&rdquo;. None of the reply pleadings include this statement. Instead, the pleadings state that the plaintiffs lacked the means to discover that they may have a claim against Nevsun &ldquo;prior to <UNDER>accessing</UNDER> legal advice&rdquo; (emphasis added).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Factum at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. Nevsun also claims that the plaintiffs could have&mdash;but did not&mdash;rely on &ldquo;challenging personal circumstances&rdquo; as a reason for postponement. But in the portions of the reply pleading in the <CASEREF><SOC>Daniel Mekonen et al. v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Mekonen Action&rdquo;) that Nevsun does not reproduce in its factum, the pleadings do exactly this. The reply explains why the plaintiffs could not discover the claims sooner by particularizing these challenging circumstances. These circumstances include:</P>
<P>(a) &ldquo;Eritrea lacks a functioning legal system through which the plaintiffs could vindicate their legal rights against Nevsun;&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply in <CASEREF><SOC>Mekonen et al v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><JUDGDATE>filed May 25, 2018</JUDGDATE><DOCKET>SCBC Action No.S-184108</DOCKET></CASEREF> (&ldquo;Mekonen Reply&rdquo;) at para 12(a), Appeal Record (&ldquo;AR&rdquo;), at Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>(b) &ldquo;Eritrea lacks lawyers willing to take on the claims of the plaintiffs;&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mekonen Reply at para 12(b), AR, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>(c) [with respect to plaintiff Ftsum Mehari] &ldquo;Traveled from Ethiopia to Kenya in February 2017, to care for his brother who suffers from schizophrenia and cannot work. Mr. Mehari has earned approximately CAD $200 per month at times since arriving in Kenya but must provide for his brother financially. As such, in Kenya, Mr. Mehari continued to lack the means to ascertain and assess his legal rights in Canada as against the defendant and could not do so until he met with Canadian counsel on January 21, 2018&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mekonen Reply at para 27(c), AR, Tab11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>(d) [with respect to Plaintiff Semere Mebrahtom] &ldquo;Left Ethiopia for Europe in or about October 2015, via Sudan, Uganda, Sudan again, and then Turkey. After several unsuccessful attempts to travel from Turkey to Greece by migrant vessel, he arrived in Greece in or about March 2017. From there, he made his way to Germany, arriving and seeking asylum in or about August 2017. While he traveled, he did not have the means to nor could he ascertain and assess his legal rights in Canada against the defendant&rdquo;;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mekonen Reply at para 32(c), AR, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P>
<P>(e) [with respect to Plaintiff Merde Araya] &ldquo;Left Ethiopia for Europe via Sudan and Egypt in or about May 2012. He was again detained in Egypt, this time for approximately 14 months. On release from detention he was deported again to Ethiopia, in or about July 2013. During this period of travel, detention in Egypt, and deportation from Egypt, he lacked the means to ascertain and assess his legal rights in Canada as against the defendant.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mekonen Reply at para 37(d), AR, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>4. Another example of Nevsun's attempt to recast the reply as being based on legal advice is its assertion that the plaintiffs claim that they &ldquo;obtained legal advice during a particular meeting with Canadian counsel, at which time they &ldquo;ascertained and assessed&rdquo; their legal rights to bring a claim against Nevsun.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Factum at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is an inaccurate rephrasing of para. 14(b) of the reply pleading in the Mekonen Action, which actually states that:
<QUOTE><P>[Plaintiff Daniel Mekonen] Fled Eritrea to Ethiopia in or about February 2011, where he has been restricted to a refugee camp by Ethiopian authorities and under a legal restriction on the right to work applicable to refugees in Ethiopia such that, in addition to the general reasons stated in paragraph 11, he lacked the financial means to ascertain and assess his legal rights in Canada as against the defendant and could not do so until he met with Canadian counsel on January 16, 2018.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Mekonen Reply at para 14(b), AR, Tab 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>5. A plea that a plaintiff was unable to ascertain and assess his legal rights because he lacked the financial means to do so <UNDER>before</UNDER> meeting with Canadian counsel is not equivalent to saying that legal advice was &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; on a particular date at which time the plaintiff &ldquo;ascertained and assessed&rdquo; his legal rights.</P>
<P>6. The plaintiffs do not point to legal advice &ldquo;received in their first meeting as the triggering event to answer a limitation defence&rdquo;, as Nevsun asserts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Factum at para 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead&mdash;as the pleadings explain&mdash;the plaintiffs' circumstances were such that they were unable to ascertain and assess their legal rights until they were able to meet with Canadian lawyers. This is vastly different from a claim that particular legal advice triggered the discovery of a claim.</P>
<P>7. Another example of Nevsun's efforts to recharacterize the record is its statement that the affidavit of Mr. Dimitri Lascaris discloses that Ms. Elizabeth Chyrum &ldquo;recruited and communicated with witnesses and clients&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Factum at para 66.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The affidavit of Mr. Lascaris states that Ms. Chyrum was retained to &ldquo;communicate&rdquo; with clients and potential clients&mdash;not &ldquo;recruit&rdquo; them. Once again, Nevsun advances vague assertions of impropriety that lack evidentiary foundation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Declaration Below is Overly Broad</EM></TI>
<P>8. In stating that it will be up to the trial judge to determine the admissibility of the information required to be produced if the order below is upheld,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Factum at para 61.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nevsun makes a concession that is not evident from the face of the order. The chambers judge did not limit the declaration of waiver to the discovery process. It applies broadly to &ldquo;all communications and documents&rdquo; across ten related actions without this qualification. Because the order is not limited to the discovery process, the chambers judge's broad declaration would appear to continue to apply at trial without this concession.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Nevsun's Attempts to Artificially Confine the Leading Cases on Implied Waiver</EM></TI>
<P>9. In its factum, Nevsun seeks to restrict the precedential value of Mr. Justice Harris's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 471</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Soprema</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> by making the rather remarkable assertion that the decision is only directed at &ldquo;cases where the cause of action advanced, as opposed to any conduct on the part of a plaintiff, brings into issue the plaintiffs state of mind and its reliance on a representation&rdquo; and that it did not change the law on implied waiver more broadly.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent Factum at para 47.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. This assertion is not supported by this Court's recent decision in <CASEREF><SOC>HMB Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, which applies <EM>Soprema</EM> in circumstances where the defendant claimed that the plaintiff had waived privilege by providing certain evidence in an affidavit&mdash;not by advancing a misrepresentation claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>HMB Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 273</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>HMB</EM>&rdquo;), at paras 20-21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Mr. Justice Hunter concluded that the chambers judge's finding of waiver was inconsistent with first principles of solicitor-client privilege (set out in <EM>Soprema</EM>) and the &ldquo;principles set out by this Court in <EM>Doman</EM> and <EM>Soprema</EM>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at paras 30&ndash;32; see also paras 40&ndash;47 where it is evident that <EM>Soprema</EM> is the leading case in BC on implied waiver of privilege.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Clearly, the division that decided <EM>HMB</EM> did not consider <EM>Soprema</EM> to only be relevant to allegations of waiver based on the plaintiff's chosen cause of action.</P>
<P>11. Further, Nevsun's attempt to narrow and distinguish <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB</EM> is undermined by its reliance on what it says is a critical distinction&mdash;that the plaintiff in <EM>Soprema</EM> &ldquo;never pleaded or otherwise referred to legal advice it received.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent Factum at para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This argument is directly undermined by <EM>HMB</EM>, which quotes with approval a passage from <CASEREF><SOC>Creative Career Systems Inc. v. Ontario</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at paras 43-44.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This passage explicitly states that disclosure by a party that it received legal advice&mdash;or even an admission that it relied on legal advice&mdash;does not waive privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Creative Career Systems Inc. v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>2012 ONSC 649</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> <EM>HMB</EM> concludes that in both that case and <EM>Soprema</EM>, the plaintiffs did not &ldquo;plead that it had relied on solicitors' advice to explain its conduct&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB</EM> at para 45.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The critical issue is whether the plaintiff has pleaded <UNDER>reliance</UNDER> on legal advice to explain its conduct&mdash;not whether the pleadings refer to the plaintiff as having received legal advice.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The Date Ms. Chyrum Was Initially Retained is Immaterial to the Errors Made Below</EM></TI>
<P>12. Nevsun's submission that litigation privilege does not attach to Ms. Chyrum's retainer because she was initially retained before Canadian counsel first met the plaintiffs is flawed for several reasons.</P>
<P>13. First, the order under appeal does not limit the production of documents relating to Ms. Chyrum's retainer to the period before counsel's first meeting with any of the plaintiffs. It presumably also captures documents relating to her continuing retainer as an agent engaged to communicate with clients and witnesses in the actions.</P>
<P>14. Second, <CASEREF><SOC>Hoy v. Medtronic</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Hoy v. Medtronic</SOC><CITE>2001 BCSC 944</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Hoy</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> does not stand for the general proposition that litigation privilege can never attach to communications between counsel and third parties prior to the client actually retaining counsel. Otherwise, counsel could never investigate claims before being retained as investigative steps taken (such as consulting experts, interviewing witnesses etc.) in anticipation of a meeting with a prospective client and a retainer would not be privileged.</P>
<P>15. <EM>Hoy</EM> considered whether documents that existed before the representative plaintiff contemplated litigation, which related to the financial arrangement between a law firm and US consulting lawyers, were privileged.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Hoy</EM> at paras 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Madam Justice Kirkpatrick emphasized that the sought-after documents (which were still not producible, since they were irrelevant) were not made to aid in the conduct of the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Hoy</EM> at para 21, 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This distinguishes the situation here, where counsel retained an agent to communicate with potential clients&mdash;in circumstances where there was a language barrier&mdash;before first meeting the clients and being retained.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT #1 OF KIMBERLY HILL</TI>
<P>I, Kimberly Hill, of Suite 400&mdash;856 Homer Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, paralegal, AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a paralegal with Camp Fiorante Matthews Mogerman (&ldquo;CFM&rdquo;), counsel for the plaintiffs in this matter and filed related matters, and as such I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to in this Affidavit except where stated to be on information and belief, in which case I verily believe them to be true.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Overview</EM></TI>
<P>1. The plaintiffs are refugees who have fled the repressive regime of Eritrea. In the underlying actions, they allege that the defendant was complicit in the use of their forced labour to construct the Bisha mine. In this proposed appeal, the plaintiffs seek to appeal the chamber judge's declaration that, through pleading that any applicable limitation periods were postponed until they had access to the legal counsel necessary to discover their claims, the plaintiffs have implicitly waived privilege over communications and documents relating to their first meeting with Canadian counsel. They also seek to appeal the chamber judge's order that they produce the details of their counsel's engagement of a third party, Ms. Elizabeth Chyrum, retained to communicate with the plaintiffs in relation to the litigation.</P>
<P>2. The chamber judge's broad declarations of waiver of privilege and his order that the plaintiffs produce details of Ms. Chyrum's retainer are not based in a particular part of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>. As these broad, ungrounded declarations are made uniformly across multiple related actions, they are not limited appeal orders within the meaning of the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM>. An appeal lies as of right.</P>
<P>3. Alternatively, if leave to appeal is required, leave is justified. The plaintiffs' proposed appeal raises serious issues concerning the correct application of the principles of waiver of privilege as they apply to pleadings of postponement. The decision below is significant and far-reaching in relation to the litigation and the practice as a whole. The interests of justice warrant an appeal.</P>
<P>4. The plaintiffs also seek a stay of execution of the order below until the proposed appeal is finally deposed of. Since the filing of the plaintiffs' original motion book, Nevsun has indicated that it will consent to a stay of execution pending appeal if the proposed appeal is allowed to proceed to a hearing on its merits.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Background</EM></TI>
<P>5. The plaintiffs in this action (the &ldquo;Araya Action&rdquo;) allege that the defendant, Nevsun Resources Ltd. (&ldquo;Nevsun&rdquo;), entered into a commercial venture with the Government of Eritrea to develop the Bisha mine in Eritrea. They allege that they were forced to work on the mine's construction under the constant threat of physical punishment, torture and imprisonment. The plaintiffs allege that Nevsun was complicit in the use of forced labour, slavery, torture, inhuman treatment and crimes against humanity.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 401</CITE><PARANUM>1&ndash;7</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. The Araya Action was originally framed as a proposed representative proceeding. After the chambers judge granted Nevsun's application challenging this form of proceeding in 2016, however, nine additional related actions were filed and served.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit #1 of Kimberly Hill, made February 12, 2019 (&ldquo;Hill #1&rdquo;), Motion Book (&ldquo;MB&rdquo;), Tab 16, at para 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There are currently ten actions involving 85 plaintiffs under the common judicial management of the chambers judge, Mr. Justice Abrioux (the &ldquo;Related Actions&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #1, MB, Tab 16, at paras 3, 4, 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> A six month trial in the Araya Action is set to begin on April 6, 2020.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #1, MB, Tab 16, at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. In reply to Nevsun's responses to civil claim, the plaintiffs have pleaded in each of the Related Actions that the actions are not subject to any limitation period. In the alternative, however, the plaintiffs plead that any limitation period applicable was postponed until at least the time when each of the plaintiffs accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel necessary to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada against Nevsun.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See e.g., Reply at para 1 in <CASEREF><SOC>Alemayo v.

<P>8. Following delivery of the replies, Nevsunbrought an application alleging that by pleading postponement, the plaintiffs in each of the Related Actions had implicitly waived privilege over all communications and documents relating to the pursuit of the actions up until the date that each of the claims were filed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application, MB, Tab 12, at para 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, Nevsun sought other declarations of waiver of solicitor-client privilege, as well as declarations that all communications between and amongst the plaintiffs with other third parties involved in the coordination of the Related Actions were either not protected by solicitor-client privilege or alternatively that the plaintiffs had waived privilege over these communications.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application, MB, Tab 12, at paras 2&ndash;5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Since Nevsun first raised the issue of waiver of privilege, the plaintiffs have not disputed that the postponement pleadings put into issue the plaintiffs' state of mind regarding the extent to which they had knowledge of the core ingredients of the lawsuit prior to first meeting Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit #8 of Roxanne Dhanpaul, sworn December 12, 2018 (&ldquo;Dhanpaul #8&rdquo;), MB, Tab 13, Exhibits M and N.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Under s. 8 of the <EM>Limitation Act</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Limitation Act</EM>, SBC 2012, c 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the plaintiffs' claims are not discoverable until they knew or reasonably ought to have known of both the necessary material facts and that a court proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek a remedy against Nevsun for their injuries.</P>
<P>10. At the hearing, Nevsun narrowed its allegations ofwaiver due to postponement, other than in the Araya Action, to the time period leading up to and including the plaintiffs' first meeting with Canadian counsel. Nevsun also abandoned or did not pursue a number of its other claims.</P>
<P>11. In oral reasons, later released in writing, the chamber judge granted Nevsun's application in part.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Oral Reasons for Judgment of Mr. Justice Abrioux (<CASEREF><SOC>Araya et al v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2019 BCSC 260</CITE></CASEREF>) (&ldquo;Reasons&rdquo;), MB, Tab 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The chamber judge found that by pleading postponement, the plaintiffs in the Related Actions, other than the Araya Action, had waived privilege over solicitor-client communications up to, and including, the first meeting they had with counsel. As the plaintiffs indicated that they intended to apply to amend the pleadings in the Araya Action, the chamber judge adjourned Nevsun's application in relation to that action. The chamber judge ordered the plaintiffs to produce the documents over which privilege had been waived within 45 days of the date of the order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, MB, Tab 1, at para 112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. The chamber judge also ordered the plaintiffs in each of the Related Actions to disclose the particulars of their counsel's retainer of Ms. Chyrum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, MB, Tab 1, at para 112.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Ms. Chyrum is an agent of counsel who is retained to communicate with clients and potential clients.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit #9 of Kimberly Hill, made December 21, 2018 (&ldquo;Hill #9&rdquo;), MB, Tab 15, at para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Ms. Chyrum has previously served as a translator on some of the plaintiffs' affidavits, however, none of these affidavits were at issue on this application.</P>
<P>13. Following the delivery of the plaintiffs' original motion book, the parties agreed to adjourn the original scheduled hearing date to allow time for release of the written reasons. The parties agreed that if this Court finds either that leave to appeal is not required or grants leave to appeal, Nevsun will consent to a stay of execution of the order pending disposition of the appeal. If this Court dismisses the plaintiffs' application for leave to appeal, the parties agreed that the plaintiffs will produce the privileged documents within five working days.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>14. This motion raises the following issues:

<P1>(b) if leave to appeal is required, whether it is the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal?</P1></P></BLOCK1>

<P>18. Here, the chamber judge's declaration of waiver extends beyond the discovery process to broad declarations of waiver that presumably extends to all aspects of the Related Actions into trial. This plainly distinguishes the proposed appeal from <CASEREF><SOC>Do Process LP v Infokey Software Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, where the declaration of waiver was limited to particular documents and the relief was sought under Rule 7-1 of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Do Process</EM> at paras 10-11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Although Nevsun referenced Rule 7-1(12) in an earlier letter demanding access to counsel's file,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Dhanpaul #8, MB, Tab 13, Exhibit M.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> neither the order, nor Nevsun's notice of application, identifies any part of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> as the basis for the declaration.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Nevsun's Notice of Application, MB, Tab 12; Order Made After Application of Mr. Justice Abrioux, entered February 21, 2019 (&ldquo;Order&rdquo;), MB, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Unlike the order at issue in <EM>Do Process</EM>, the order below makes a stand-alone declaration of waiver independent of particular documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Do Process</EM> at para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. Further, the chamber judge's order that the plaintiffs produce details of Ms. Chyrum's retainer appears to be unmoored from any issue in the pleadings that would justify production under Rule 7-1 or any other relevant rule of court.</P>
<P>20. Since the jurisdictional basis for the chamber judge's order is not under Part 7 of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> (or any prescribed limited appeal order under Rule 2.1), it follows that the appeal may proceed as of right.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>Reasons Why Leave to Appeal Should be Granted</EM></TI>
<P>21. In any event, even if the order below is a limited appeal order, leave to appeal is justified.</P>
<P>22. The main considerations on an application for leave to appeal are:
<P1>(a) whether the point on appeal is of significance to the practice;</P1>
<P1>(b) whether the point raised is of significance to the action itself;</P1>
<P1>(c) whether the appeal is <EM>prima facie</EM> meritorious or, on the other hand, whether it is frivolous; and</P1>
<P1>(d) whether the appeal will unduly hinder the progress of the action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Michael Wilson &amp; Partners, Ltd. v. Desir&ea;e Resources Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 296</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>23. The overarching question is whether granting leave to appeal is in the interests of justice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Prospects of Success of the Proposed Appeal</TI>
<P>24. At this stage, the applicant is only required to show that the proposed appeal is not frivolous.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Windshield Doctor Canada Ltd. v. Glass Masters Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2005 BCCA 220</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. The plaintiffs' proposed appeal clearly meets this low threshold. If the appeal proceeds, the question of whether the court below correctly identified and applied the test for waiver of privilege is a question of law evaluated on a correctness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 471</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Soprema</EM> Appeal&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs raise serious issues about the correctness of the chamber judge's articulation and application of these principles.</P>
<P>26. On the first ground of appeal, the plaintiffs intend to argue that the court below erred in law by finding that the plaintiffs have waived privilege over communications connected to their first meeting with Canadian counsel. As the plaintiffs have always acknowledged, the pleadings put in issue their state of mind prior to first meeting Canadian counsel, including the nature of any legal advice that may have informed this state of mind.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Dhanpaul #8, MB, Tab 12, Exhibit N.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> What is far from clear, however, is how the pleadings put in issue the plaintiffs' reliance on the legal advice they received at their first meeting with Canadian counsel.</P>
<P>27. Waiver of solicitor-client privilege requires more than a pleading that puts the privilege-holder's &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; at issue<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> Appeal at paras 52-53.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC></CASEREF>&rdquo;, this Court clarified that even though legal advice may be relevant to a privilege-holder's state of mind on a material issue, waiver can only be implied if the privilege-holder voluntarily injects the legal advice it received or its understanding of the law into the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> Appeal at para 49; <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 263</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>HMB Holdings</EM> Appeal&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As this Court stated recently in <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, &ldquo;[i]n the absence of either pleadings, evidence or argument asserting reliance on legal advice, [...] invocation of fairness and consistency are insufficient to ground waiver.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB Holdings</EM> Appeal at para 47; Adam M. Dodek, <EM>Solicitor-Client Privilege</EM> (LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2014) at 7.143: &ldquo;Simply putting state of mind at issue without reliance on legal advice does not suffice for waiver&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. These authorities do not support the chamber judge's conclusion that the plaintiffs have waived privilege over their first meeting with counsel. The chamber judge failed to consider whether, by pleading postponement until they had access to legal advice of Canadian counsel, the plaintiffs actually invoked reliance on that legal advice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Reasons, MB, Tab 1, at para 90.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. The content of the privileged communications exchanged at the first meeting with Canadian counsel is irrelevant to assessing the strength of the plaintiffs' pleas of postponement. No matter what advice they received during the first meeting, the communication contents do not shed light on whether the plaintiffs could have discovered earlier that a court action in British Columbia was an appropriate means of proceeding. In the absence of relevancy, it is difficult to see how the pleadings put in issue the plaintiffs' reliance on these communications.</P>
<P>30. Further, the chamber judge's order is unprecedented in the context of other decisions that have considered the relationship between pleadings of postponement and waiver of privilege. All of the cases Nevsun relied on below arose in contexts where postponement was sought for a period of time beyond the initial retainer of counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Jack v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>[2004] O. J. No. 3294</CITE><PARANUM>114&ndash;124</PARANUM><COURTJUR>SCJ</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2002 BCCA 557</CITE><PARANUM>5&ndash;9, 15</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Camosun College v. Levelton Engineering Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 1190</CITE><PARANUM>13&ndash;18, 25</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Camosun College</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By pleading postponement past the date they retained counsel, the plaintiffs in these cases implicitly relied on a change in legal advice or in their counsel's knowledge as a basis for postponement. The same cannot be said here, where the plaintiffs do not contest that any applicable limitation period began to toll as soon as they had access to Canadian counsel.</P>
<P>31. The chamber judge also placed considerable weight on a 2014 journal article, in which the author argues that the time period over which privilege is waived should include the pleaded discovery date.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, MB, Tab 1, at para 80; Jonathan de Vries, &ldquo;<EM>Privilege and Limitations: The Impact of Raising the Discoverability of Claims on Solicitor-Client Privilege</EM>&rdquo;(2014) The Advocates Quarterly 43 at 252 (&ldquo;de Vries&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Neither of the two Ontario Superior Court of Justice decisions the author relied on for this point support this proposition as being_a broad rule of general application, particularly in situations such as the one here, where the plaintiffs do not plead postponement past the date they retained counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Davenport v. Roughley Estate</SOC><CITE>2003 CarswellOnt 766</CITE><COURTJUR>SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Davenport</EM>&rdquo;); <CASEREF><SOC>Lawless v. Anderson</SOC><CITE>2009 CanLII 58602</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <CASEREF><SOC>Davenport v. Roughley Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, for example, the period of time over which Master Beaudoin found that privilege had been waived went up to, but did not include, the earliest possible pleaded triggering date for the start of the limitation period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Davenport</EM> at paras 2, 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition, the author's comments appear directed at situations where the plaintiff had access to a lawyer prior to the alleged discovery of the claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See de Vries at 230.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. The plaintiffs' second proposed ground of appeal is that even if the plaintiffs implicitly waived privilege over some aspects of otherwise privileged communications relating to their first meeting with Canadian counsel, the chamber judge erred by making an overly broad declaration of waiver that goes beyond what is necessary to achieve a just result.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun College</EM> at para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The chamber judge's order that the waiver extends to all documents and communications relating to pursuit of the Related Actions and the claims they advance is not clearly limited to the issue of postponement.</P>
<P>33. As the Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized, solicitor-client privilege must be as close to absolute as possible.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Privacy Commissioner) v. Blood Tribe Department of Health</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 44</CITE><PARANUM>9</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Blood Tribe</EM>&rdquo;)] <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. McClure</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 14</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Any waiver of solicitor-client privilege should thus be construed narrowly, and privileged communications should be disclosed only to the extent absolutely necessary to achieve fairness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Camosun College</EM> at para 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The waiver should therefore be limited to the specific matter put in issue by the postponement plea,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Biehl v. Strang</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 213</CITE><PARANUM>65&ndash;67</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that is whether the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known prior to meeting Canadian counsel that an action against Nevsun in Canada would be appropriate.</P>
<P>34. Lastly, the plaintiffs wish to appeal the chamber judge's order that they produce documents relating to the particulars of their counsel's engagement or retainer of Ms. Chyrum, who is retained as an agent of counsel to communicate with clients and potential clients.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #9, MB, Tab 15, at para 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. The chamber judge's order that Ms. Chyrum's retainer be produced is not properly grounded in the context of this application. Instead, the order appears to be based on Nevsun's general assertion that Ms. Chyrum's role as agent of counsel and her work as a human rights activist raises the spectre of bias in her role as the translator of some of the plaintiffs' affidavits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons at para 109.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Even if the information that Ms. Chyrum is retained to communicate with plaintiffs is relevant to this issue, the question of potential bias in Ms. Chyrum's translations does not arise on this application. Further, Nevsun's notice of application did not include a specific request for production of Ms. Chyrum's retainer and the plaintiffs did not rely on any of Ms. Chyrum's translations in responding to the application. The allegation that Ms. Chyrum's work as a human rights activist colours and invalidates her translations of some of the evidence should have been made in the context of a challenge to particular evidence, not as a general, free-standing assertion.</P>
<P>37. In addition, the plaintiffs intend to argue that the chamber judge erred by not considering whether the production of Ms. Chyrum's retainer would improperly intrude into litigation privilege. The details of a party's retainer of a third party consultant retained for the purposes of litigation fall plainly within the &ldquo;zone of privacy&rdquo; litigation privilege is intended to protect.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</SOC><CITE>2006 SCC 39</CITE><PARANUM>28, 34</PARANUM></CASEREF>; J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <EM>The Law of Evidence in Canada</EM>, 5th ed (LexisNexis Canada Inc., March 2018), at 14.223.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Like solicitor-client privilege, litigation privilege is not subject to a case-by-case balancing test.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 52</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Lizotte</EM>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Where fundamental rules such as solicitor client or litigation privilege would otherwise shield the document from disclosure, it is not enough that the document may be relevant or that a general balancing of interests appears to favour disclosure.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> Appeal at para 53; <EM>Lizotte</EM> at para 41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The chamber judge failed to consider whether one of the defined exceptions to litigation privilege applied or whether the privilege had been waived. Instead, his reasons are limited to the issues of whether Ms. Chyrum's retainer is relevant to assessing her role in solicitor-client communications and Nevsun's general allegations of potential bias and impropriety (despite the lack of a specific pleading or evidentiary objection on this point).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons, MB, Tab 1, at paras 83, 107, 109.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Importance of the Proposed Appeal to the Parties</TI>
<P>39. The proposed appealis clearly important to the partiesin each of the Related Actions. Solicitor-client privilege is &ldquo;jealously guarded&rdquo; for good reason.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Pritchard v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission)</SOC><CITE>2004 SCC 31</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> As Justice Binnie cautioned in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Privacy Commissioner) v. Blood Tribe Department of Health</SOC></CASEREF>, &ldquo;[e]xperience shows that people who have a legal problem will often not make a clean breast of the facts to a lawyer without an assurance of confidentiality &ldquo;as close to absolute as possible&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Blood Tribe</EM> at para 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The privilege is fundamentally important to the legal system and plays a key role in facilitating access to justice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Alberta Information and Privacy Commissioner v. University of Calgary</SOC><CITE>2016 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>34</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In this context, unwarranted intrusion into privileged communications has the potential to compromise the fairness of the eventual trials on the merits.</P>
<P>40. The chamber judge's broad declarations of waiver ofprivile across multiple related actions and to the claims of 85 plaintiffs. Whether or not this intrusion is justified in the circumstances is clearly a matter of importance in the litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 309</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Soprema</EM> Chambers&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Importance of the Appeal to the Practice</TI>
<P>41. The issue of when and how pleadings of postponementimp solicitor-client privilege is also significant to the profession generally. Clarification of uncertainty or confusion that may exist over the principles of solicitor-client and litigation privilege and the court's power to order waiver are recognized as important matters that warrant this Court's attention.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM> Chambers at para 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. The profession would benefit from clarification from this Court over how principles of implicit waiver apply in the context of pleadings of postponement that put in issue the plaintiff's state of mind but do not clearly invoke reliance on legal advice. As one commentator put it, waiver based on &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; is &ldquo;the most confusing area of implied waiver jurisprudence.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Adam M. Dodek, <EM>Solicitor-Client Privilege</EM> (LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2014), at 7.131.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The issue of how the principles articulated in <EM>Soprema</EM> and <EM>HMB Holdings</EM> apply in the context of a plea of postponement is a significant issue to the practice as a whole.</P>
<P>43. Further, the interaction between waiver of privilege and a pleading of postponement based on a lack of access to legal advice (as opposed to one based on a lack of legal knowledge), is a novel circumstance in which the Court's guidance about the application of waiver in this context is relevant to the practice as a whole. As Justice Tysoe explained recently in the chambers decision in <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC></CASEREF>, &ldquo;waiver of solicitor-client privilege is a matter of significance to the profession generally because it is instructive to the profession to be aware of the situations in which privilege can be found to have been waived.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>HMB Holdings</EM> Chambers at para 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Guidance on when pleadings of postponement based on a lack of access to legal advice implicitly waive privilege over legal communications is beneficial to the profession generally.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Utility of the Proposed Appeal and Whether the Appeal Would Cause Undue Delay</TI>
<P>44. As described above, the proposed appeal raises serious issues about whether the chamber judge properly articulated and applied principles of solicitor-client and litigation privilege and their waiver. These are significant and important issues to the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>45. In contrast, Nevsun will suffer little prejudice if leave to appeal is granted. Trial in the Araya Action is not set to begin until April 6, 2020.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #1, MB, Tab 16, at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs are prepared to expedite the appeal. The proposed appeal raises discrete issues concerning several categories of privileged communications. According to the court's schedule of available dates for appeal hearings, there are multiple hearing dates currently available in April, May and June 2019.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Hill #1, MB, Tab 16, at para 17, Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appeal can be heard well before the trial in the Araya Action is set to begin.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I: STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiffs' proposed appeal raises no point of principle requiring consideration by this Court. It is, instead, an attempt to challenge a case management judge's application of settled principles regarding the waiver of privilege that arises as a result of a plea of postponement in response to a limitation defence. The plaintiffs agreed there had been a waiver of privilege. The only question was the scope of that waiver. The defendant Nevsun Resources Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Nevsun</BOLD>&rdquo;) said, and the judge agreed, that the waiver included information exchanged at the plaintiffs' first meeting with counsel. The judge also agreed with Nevsun that the plaintiffs had to disclose the particulars of their retainer with a person who is now alleged to be an agent for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs failed to establish that privilege attached to that retainer.</P>
<P>2. Fundamentally, these orders relate to the production of documents in a complex case-managed proceeding. Leave to appeal is required from such orders.</P>
<P>3. It is not in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal. The plaintiffs' appeal merely takes issue with the judge's application of settled legal principles. An appeal would delay the progress of a complex, idiosyncratic proceeding where a number of ongoing and related interlocutory issues are currently before by the judge. It would disrupt ongoing discoveries set to take place around the world and the trial of the actions, the form of which is being determined by the judge.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<P>4. The background to this case is summarized at paragraphs 4&ndash;13 of the judgment sought to be appealed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Amended Motion Book (&ldquo;<BOLD>AMB</BOLD>&rdquo;), Tab 1, Oral Reasons for Judgment of Abrioux J., January 18, 2019 (&ldquo;<BOLD>Reasons</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is &ldquo;extremely complex&rdquo; litigation, which has been under judicial management by Abrioux J. since 2015. It involves ten actions and 85 plaintiffs, who allege the Bisha mine in Eritrea was built using forced labour by the Eritrean Government, the military, and its contractors. Nevsun denies all allegations. Abrioux J. recognized from the outset that the proceedings would be a &ldquo;challenge'' to manage and try, and would require &ldquo;extensive case management&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 1856</CITE><PARANUM>250, 292-293 and 571</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> That has been the case. The plaintiffs are resident in Ethiopia, Egypt, Kenya, Israel, France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Canada.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Case Management and Related Orders</TI>
<P>5. In April 2018, the parties argued several applications, including whether test or &ldquo;bellwether&rdquo; cases should be selected and tried (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Bellwether Application</BOLD>&rdquo;). The parties entered into a consent order (the &ldquo;<BOLD>April 6 Order</BOLD>&rdquo;), which set deadlines for document discovery, permitted Nevsun to proceed with examinations for discovery of all plaintiffs subject to further order, and adjourned the Bellwether Application to 2019. As a placeholder pending determination of the Bellwether Application, Abrioux J. set a trial date in the Araya action &ldquo;for a minimum six month period to commence April 1, 2020&rdquo;. Abrioux J. explained that &ldquo;as these proceedings move forward&rdquo;, one of the &ldquo;key issues&rdquo; for the court to decide is whether Bellwether cases should be chosen as sought by the plaintiffs and, if so, which ones and on what issues, or whether the actions should be tried at the same time. He noted that &ldquo;[o]n either approach a significant amount of trial time will be required&rdquo;, with &ldquo;the ultimate trial time being up to two years&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 808</CITE><PARANUM>11, 40-41</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. Since the April 6 Order, Abrioux J. has held multiple judicial management conferences and heard numerous applications. In December 2018, Nevsun applied for orders that the plaintiffs produce documents and affidavits of documents. On January 21, 2019, in related reasons, Abrioux J. found that the plaintiffs' lists of documents were inadequate, and that the plaintiffs had not complied with document discovery orders and their obligations under the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>SCCR</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;). The judge ordered production of the requested documents, and ordered some plaintiffs to provide affidavits of documents. In making these orders, Abrioux J. noted that &ldquo;given that examinations for discovery are ongoing and the trial is in approximately 14 months, the actions are at a critical juncture ... the parties must expend considerable effort if there is any reasonable prospect for the trial to commence as scheduled.&rdquo; Abrioux J. added that the preparation for and hearing of the Bellwether application was a &ldquo;key intervening step&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Araya v. Nevsun Resources Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2019 BCSC 262</CITE><PARANUM>20-21</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD>Document Reasons</BOLD>&rdquo;). [Emphasis added.]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Abrioux J. also granted an order that Nevsun may conduct a further ten examinations by July 1, 2019 prior to the Beliwether Application. To that point, Nevsun had conducted seven examinations for discovery: two in the U.S., four in Europe, and one in B.C. The examinations have been difficult to arrange and all have required the use of interpreters. They were adjourned pending certain requests, rulings on objections (some of which were the subject of the application below), and further document discovery. Abrioux J. concluded that further discoveries were appropriate taking into account his knowledge of the case &ldquo;and the ongoing nature of the Bellwether applications and trial preparation and in particular, the need for the court to have a proper evidentiary record to consider the [Bellwether applications].&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Document Reasons, para. 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Since this decision, appointments to examine three of the plaintiffs have been delivered for April 22&ndash;30, 2019 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply Book, Tab 5, Affidavit of Gregory Berry, filed March 7, 2019, Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. On February 19, 2019, one of the plaintiffs, Abadi Alemayo, filed an application for leave to appeal Abrioux J.'s January 21, 2019 order that he list and produce documents relating to criminal proceedings against him in Switzerland.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Plaintiffs' Pleas of Postponement and Order Sought to be Appealed</TI>
<P>9. Nevsun's defences include that the plaintiffs' actions are statute-barred under Eritrean and B.C. law. In their Replies, the plaintiffs plead that the limitation period was &ldquo;postponed until at least the time when they accessed the legal advice of Canadian counsel to ascertain and assess their legal rights in Canada against Nevsun&rdquo;. They refer to the complexity of the legal issues and go on to assert that &ldquo;[p]rior to accessing the legal advice&rdquo; of Canadian counsel, they &ldquo;lacked the means to discover&rdquo; both that they had a claim against Nevsun and that an action in B.C. &ldquo;was the appropriate means of seeking a remedy against Nevsun&rdquo;. The plaintiffs plead that &ldquo;in order to ascertain and assess their legal rights against&rdquo; Nevsun, they &ldquo;required the benefit of legal advice from Canadian lawyers&rdquo;. The Araya plaintiffs alleged the limitation period applicable to their claims was postponed until the date the Araya action was commenced. The other plaintiffs pleaded postponement to the date of their first meeting with Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB, Tab 1, Reasons, paras. 63&ndash;67.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Nevsun applied for an order that the plaintiffs produce documents over which privilege had been waived by virtue of the plea of postponement, as well as declarations that privilege had been waived. The declarations sought reflected Nevsun's position that the plaintiffs had not delivered lists of privileged documents i n compliance with Rule 7-1(7),<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A step the plaintiffs have since agreed to take: Document Reasons, para. 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> preventing Nevsun from applying for specific documents.</P>
<P>11. Nevsun also applied for an order determining objections, mainly on the basis of solicitor-client privilege, made at the plaintiffs' examinations. Some of the objections related to communications with counsel prior to the date on which postponement was claimed. Others related to communications with Elsa Chryum. Ms. Chryum is an Eritrean human rights advocate. She has had diverse involvement with the plaintiffs, helping (as early as 2010) to locate counsel to bring an action against Nevsun; acting as a reference in asylum claims; serving as an interpreter for affidavits;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>A role which requires the interpreter to be objective and unbiased: <CASEREF><SOC>Luu v. Wang</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 1201</CITE><PARANUM>8&ndash;13</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and, as disclosed for the first time at the hearing below, as of May 1, 2013, evidently acting on behalf of counsel to &ldquo;communicate with witnesses, potential clients, and clients in action(s) against Nevsun&rdquo;. Prior to Nevsun's application, the plaintiffs had maintained that Ms. Chryum was an unbiased and independent translator and interpreter. When Nevsun raised concerns with her role and her objectivity and impartiality, the plaintiffs rejected those concerns, but did not assert that Ms. Chryum was an agent of counsel and did not disclose her agreement to act as an agent of counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 13Q and 13R, Affidavit of Roxanne Dhanpaul #8, filed December 19, 2018, Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, pp. 434&ndash;436; Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;, pp. 438&ndash;440.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> On the waiver application, Nevsun argued the plaintiffs had not established that the communications with Ms. Chryum that were subject of objections on discovery were privileged.</P>
<P>12. During the hearing of Nevsun's application, counsel for the plaintiffs advised that the Reply filed in the Araya action erroneously pleaded postponement until the date of filing of the Notice of Civil Claim: November 20, 2014. Counsel advised the court that the plaintiffs would be applying to amend that Reply. In response, counsel for Nevsun alleged that this admission amounted to a further waiver.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 1, Reasons, paras. 91&ndash;95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. In the judgment sought to be appealed, Abrioux J. noted that the parties &ldquo;essentially agreed on the law&rdquo;, and that the plaintiffs admitted that &ldquo;privilege has been waived&rdquo;. The issue was the scope of the waiver. Abrioux J. agreed that the plaintiffs' plea of postponement put their reliance on legal advice at issue from the accrual of the claim to the date of the &ldquo;paradigm shift&rdquo; or date where they were able to receive advice to &ldquo;ascertain and assess&rdquo; their rights, which he found to include the first meeting with Canadian counsel.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 1, Reasons, paras. 69&ndash;71, 77&ndash;80, 85&ndash;90.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Abrioux J. agreed that the plaintiffs' application to amend the Reply in the Araya action and Nevsun's further consequential waiver application should be heard expeditiously and set a schedule for the filing of materials.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 1, Reasons, paras. 91&ndash;95.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Finally, Abrioux J. adjourned Nevsun's application for a determination of objections at discovery, but found that the particulars of Ms. Chryum's retainer should be disclosed to assist in delineating her precise role while acting as an alleged third party agent for counsel, and as potentially relevant to Nevsun's allegations of bias arising from her translator and interpreter functions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 1, Reasons, paras. 101&ndash;111.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The parties subsequently filed materials in connection with the plaintiffs' amendment application and Nevsun's further waiver application in the Araya action. Nevsun's further waiver application was heard on February 19, 2019.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II: STATEMENT OF THE POINTS IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>14. The issues are (a) whether leave to appeal of the order of Abrioux J. is required; (b) if leave is required, whether leave should be granted; and (c) if leave is granted, the terms on which the order should be stayed.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART III: ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>15. Abrioux J.'s order is a &ldquo;limited appeal order&rdquo; under the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM>. That rule provides that an order granting or refusing relief under Part 7 of the <EM>SCCR</EM> is a limited appeal order. The declaration was sought because of the state of the plaintiffs' listing of privileged documents; the fact the ruling was expressed as a declaration does not affect the substance of the order. Abrioux J.'s order confirms that the plaintiffs have waived privilege and requires the plaintiffs to produce documents and answer questions on discovery. These orders arise in the discovery process and fall squarely within Part 7 of the <EM>SCCR</EM>.</P>
<P>16. Contrary to the plaintiffs' submissions, there is no basis to distinguish the decision of Justice Goepel in <CASEREF><SOC>Do Process LP v. Infokey Software Inc.</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Do Process LP v.

<BLOCK2><TI>Leave to Appeal Should Not be Granted</TI>
<P>17. The factors to consider on a leave application are set out at paragraphs 22-23 of the plaintiffs' memorandum of argument.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. v. Sessions et al.</SOC><CITE>2000 BCCA 326</CITE><DECIDER>Saunders J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the test for leave to appeal. It is not in the interests of justice to grant leave.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Proposed Grounds of Appeal do not have Merit</TI>
<P>18. The proposed appeal has no prospect of success. The plaintiffs do not identify an extricable question of law or allege an &ldquo;erroneous assumption about the law&rdquo; in Abrioux J.'s application of the facts to the law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mayer v. Mayer</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 77</CITE><PARANUM>188</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE><PARANUM>36</PARANUM></CASEREF>. <CASEREF><SOC>Do Process LP v. Infokey Software Inc.</SOC><CITE>2015 BCCA 52</CITE><PARANUM>21-22</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Do Process</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There was no dispute below on the principles governing waiver of privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Soprema Inc. v. Wolrige Mahon LLP</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 471</CITE><PARANUM>22, 44, 49</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Soprema</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;); <CASEREF><SOC>H.M.B. Holdings Limited v. Replay Resorts Inc.</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 263</CITE><PARANUM>42&ndash;46</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>HMB</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;)</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The plaintiffs admitted that there was a waiver of privilege; the only question was the extent of that waiver. The plaintiffs' appeal is nothing more than a challenge to Abrioux J.'s assessment and characterization of the meaning and effect of the pleadings in the context of the ongoing prosecution of this case, with which he is thoroughly familiar.</P>
<P>19. It was open to Abrioux J. to find that the words used in the Replies confirmed that the plaintiffs relied on the legal advice obtained in the first meeting to understand their rights, which later changed their actions. There is no basis for this Court to revisit the case management judge's assessment of the pleadings, the relevant background, and the interests of fairness to the parties.</P>
<P>20. The plaintiffs argue that the case management judge fell into error by citing a 2014 article by Jonathan de Vries for the proposition that a waiver based on postponement includes information relevant to the act of discovery itself.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>De Vries, &ldquo;Privilege and Limitations: The Impact of Raising the Discoverability of Claims on Solicitor-Client Privilege&rdquo;, (2014) 43 Advocates Quarterly 219&ndash;256 (&ldquo;<BOLD>De Vries</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Contrary to the plaintiffs' submission, the law in B.C. is entirely consistent with the proposition articulated in the de Vries article, that the temporal scope of waiver extends beyond the putative discovery date identified by the plaintiff, a proposition which this Court implicitly accepted in the <EM>Harry</EM> case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Harry v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2002 BCCA 557</CITE><PARANUM>13&ndash;18</PARANUM></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Harry</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), <CASEREF><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirming</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2001 BCSC 1566</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Harry SC</EM></BOLD>).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This makes sense. As pointed out by de Vries immediately before the passage quoted by Abrioux J., it is the plaintiff who selects the discovery date or period; as a matter of fairness, Nevsun should be entitled to test through discovery the validity of that date of alleged postponement, particularly where, as here, different periods of postponement are pleaded.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>De Vries, pp. 251&ndash;254.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. The plaintiffs' second proposed ground of appeal alleges that the judge's order on the scope of disclosure went beyond what was necessary to achieve a just result. The plaintiffs articulate no extricable error of law in this ground, other than to vaguely suggest the judge erred in his &ldquo;application of the principles of waiver of privilege&rdquo;. The judge was clearly alive to the nature of solicitor-client privilege, which he called &ldquo;virtually sacrosanct&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>AMB Tab 1, Reasons, para. 71.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He assessed the interests of fairness in reaching a decision he considered just to both parties.</P>
<P>22. The plaintiffs' final ground of appeal, concerning disclosure of the terms of Ms. Chryum's retainer, also has no reasonable prospect of success.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Shooting Star Amusements Ltd. v. Prince George Agricultural and Historical Association</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 452</CITE><DECIDER>Newbury J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The context here is important. Nevsun sought determinations on certain objections made by plaintiffs' counsel in the course of examinations. Abrioux J. adjourned the relief concerning those objections, as they are likely addressed by the waiver order, but ordered disclosure of Ms. Chryum's agreement&mdash;which the plaintiffs themselves raised and on which they relied, without disclosing it or its terms&mdash;because the record did not support the plaintiffs' assertion of privilege over her communications with the plaintiffs. In other words, this ground of appeal does not give rise to any legal issue about waiver. Given Ms. Chryum's dual role, production of the terms of her retainer is necessary to assess the validity of the plaintiffs' objections. There is no basis for this Court to interfere with the case management judge's order on this point.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The Points Raised on Appeal are not of Significance to the Practice</TI>
<P>23. The points raised on this proposed appeal are not of significance to the practice. The issues on the proposed appeal do not require clarification, are well-settled, and have been addressed recently by this Court. The legal principles were not in dispute in the Court below, and the orders turn on particular facts and pleadings in this unusual case. Appeals from orders that are specific to the action and specific to particular procedural histories of the parties will not be of importance to the practice.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gichuru v. Law Society of British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 159</CITE><PARANUM>20</PARANUM><DECIDER>Bennett J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Gichuru</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;); <CASEREF><SOC>National Union Fire insurance Company of Pittsburgh v.

<P>24. The principles of implied waiver are well-established, and this Court has addressed the issue on at least five occasions since 2014.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Brown v. Clark Wilson LLP</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 185</CITE></CASEREF>; <EM>Do Process, Soprema</EM>; <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Lee</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 219</CITE></CASEREF>; <EM>HMB</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Court recently agreed with the conclusion of a justice that an appeal where one of the grounds was waiver of privilege was of no significance because that law was settled.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Albu v. The University of British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2018 BCCA 185</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The principles regarding waiver of privilege as a result of pleading postponement were also addressed by this Court in <EM>Harry</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Harry</EM>, affirming <EM>Harry SC</EM>, para. 15; <CASEREF><SOC>Camosun College v. Levelton Engineering Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2014 BCSC 1190</CITE></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Jack v. Canada</SOC><CITE>[2004] O.J. No. 3294</CITE><COURTJUR>Sup. Ct. J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; De Vries, pp. 252-253.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and require no additional clarification because they are consistent with this Court's most recent pronouncements on waiver of privilege.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Soprema</EM>, para. 49; <EM>HMB</EM>, para. 46.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. An appeal relating to the order of Ms. Chyrum's retainer raises no point requiring clarification or of significance to the profession. The case management judge concluded that disclosure of the terms of her retainer would be of assistance in delineating her precise role. The proposed appeal on this issue engages nothing but the failure of the plaintiffs to establish privilege on the evidence before the judge.</P>
<P>26. In short, the substance of the proposed appeal concerns the application of settled principles of the law of privilege, in a proceeding that is complex and unique, both substantively and procedurally. An appeal would be of limited utility and any decision by this Court would be confined to the facts of this case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cooper v. Hobart et al.</SOC><CITE>1999 BCCA 231</CITE><DECIDER>Cumming J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>An Appeal will Unduly Hinder the Progress of the Action</TI>
<P>27. Leave should be refused where an appeal would delay the orderly preparation of the action for trial or result in an adjournment. Even if the appeal can be expedited, delay will affect the prosecution and defence of this case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gichuru</EM>, para. 23; <CASEREF><SOC>Wolsley Canada Inc. v. Emco Corporation</SOC><CITE>2008 BCCA 18</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM><DECIDER>Prowse J.A.</DECIDER><COURTJUR>in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. Here, an appeal would necessarily interfere with ongoing proceedings in the Supreme Court. Nevsun would be forced to choose between adjourning overseas discoveries of the plaintiffs or proceeding without the benefit of the documents the judge found were necessary to evaluate the postponement allegations. The discoveries are part of a comprehensive case management plan choreographed by Abrioux J. Their scheduling, in turn, affects the timing of the Bellwether Application and could jeopardize preparations for the trial date, particularly with the large number of discoveries that remain to be completed after July 1, 2019. Many of the claims are dated,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The earliest claims date from 2005. The majority of the plaintiffs allege they left the Bisha Mine in 2010.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and the already-significant evidentiary difficulties in this litigation will be exacerbated by delay. In these circumstances, permitting an interlocutory appeal on the issue of the scope of an admitted waiver of privilege would not be in the interests of justice.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Stay of Proceedings Pending Determination of the Appeal</TI>
<P>29. If leave is granted, provided that the appeal is expedited, Nevsun agrees that there should be a stay of Abrioux J.'s order pending determination of the appeal.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
