<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. March 28 2017. Peter Scholz enquiries of Qairrulik Outfitting for the one-day rental of a snowmachine. The planned route is discussed at some length between the defendant and plaintiff.</P>
<P>2. March 29 2017. Enroute on a (roughly) 150km circular route, Peter Scholz encounters an impassible geographic boundary and does not have fuel to return the way he came. The nature of the feature is that it is passable only at high tide. He abandons the snowmachine, climbs over an ice cliff past the impassible geographic boundary, and walks towards Iqaluit. He is found by a passing helicopter at dusk 25km outside Iqaluit. Peter Scholz meets Guy Vachon that evening and describes the location of the snowmachine.</P>
<P>3. March 30 2017. Guy Vachon issues an invoice for the recovery of the snowmachine.</P>
<P>4. May 1 2017. Guy Vachon issues a small claims court claim for the invoice above.</P>
<P>5. July 2017. Mediation fails to find a settlement. Peter Scholz's offer of an intermediary sum is declined by Guy Vachon. Guy Vachon does not make a counter-offer.</P>
<P>6. November 17 2017. Pre-hearing by telephone. The presiding judge, Paul Bychok, sets a new date and orders Peter Scholz to come to Iqaluit for the small claims court hearing. Peter Scholz indicates he will not attend in person due to travel costs. He is told he will lose the case if he does not come.</P>
<P>7. December 3 2017. Peter Scholz writes letters of complaint about the order to appear in Iqaluit to the Nunatsiaq News, the Nunavut Minister of Justice, and the MLA for Arviat North.</P>
<P>8. January 2018. Judge Bychok notifies by email that the small claims session may be by teleconference.</P>
<P>9. January 30 2018. Hearing is undertaken by telephone.</P>
<P>10. March 21 2017. Paul Bychok finds in favour of the plaintiff in a written decision.</P>
<P>11. Peter Scholz orders transcripts of the Jan. 30 2018 Hearing on March 22, 2018. By April 5, 2018, the deadline for appeal is approaching, no response had been made from the court reporter, and so that transcript is not included.</P>
<P>12. The required stationary specifications for Appeals are not available in the defendant's home community of Arviat.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART 2&mdash;GROUNDS OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. Inconsistencies and outright lies in the statements by the Plaintiff:
<P1>a. On March 28, 2017, Guy Vachon of Qairrulik Outfitting told Peter Scholz that Mr. Scholz's proposed route would be &ldquo;bumpy&rdquo; on the Frobisher Bay portion. On March 29, 2017, after the rescue, Mr. Vachon told Peter Scholz a different story: that Mr. Vachon had warned Mr. Scholz about dangers in Frobisher Bay. In court on January 30 2018, Mr. Vachon stated both that he had warned Mr. Scholz about an area of particular danger, and stated that much of his supposed damages related to finding the machine. But if Mr. Vachon had actually issued a warning, he would have known where the dangerous area was, he would have known where to find the machine. In addition, at no time did Mr. Vachon reach out to Mr. Scholz, during the supposed search for the machine, for additional information to help him find the machine. Judge Bychok did not take these into account in his decision.</P1>
<P1>b. On March 28 and 29, 2017, Mr. Vachon and a Qairrulik Outfitting employee of Inuit descent told Peter Scholz, on three separate occasions (twice on March 28 and once on the morning of March 29), there was &ldquo;no way&rdquo; that an additional tank of fuel would be needed as the particular snowmachine being rented had very good range and would &ldquo;go more than a full day without refueling&rdquo;. Mr. Vachon said again, on the evening of March 29 after the rescue, that his other machines never came back less than half-full. Mr. Vachon never denies having made these statements. He did not deny making those statements during the mediation hearing either. However, near the end of the January 30 2018 telephone hearing, the Qairrulik Outfitting employee of Inuit descent, clearly lied to the presiding judge, saying that he had warned Mr. Scholz to get an extra tank of gas. The employee's statement was inconsistent with Mr. Vachon's, yet Judge Bychok still considered both testimonies equally credible. Since the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, lying to the judge should be enough to get the case thrown out.</P1>
<P1>c. The transcripts for the January 30 2018 trial, if they can be procured, will show the snowmachine was supposedly found on April 1, 2017. However, the invoice was issued on March 30, 2017. Mr. Vachon prepared the invoice apparently before he found the snowmachine.</P1></P>
<P>2. The neutrality and objectivity of Judge Paul Bychok is questionable. Mr. Bychok was clearly disrespectful and borderline derogatory in the telephone to Mr. Scholz at the telephone meeting on November 17 2017. In order to force the judge to recant his earlier decision, Peter Scholz deliberately and publicly shamed Judge Bychok (see attached letters, sent to the media, to the Minister of Justice, and to the MLA) due to Judge Bychok's command to come to Iqaluit for an in-person hearing. Judge Bychok should have excused himself from the case, as his optical objectivity had clearly been compromised. Evidence of this:
<P1>a. The January 2018 transcript will hopefully show that Judge Boychok was questioning Mr. Vachon on the legality of his seeking compensation for gas. Mr. Scholz intervened and stated that Mr. Vachon had told Mr. Scholz that Mr. Scholz would need to pay for gas. This should have created more credibility in the defendant, as it would have been in the defendant's best interest to allow the judge to rule out gas expenses. In regards to owing fuel costs, the defendant defended the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was right. Judge Bychok ignored this in finding for the testimonies of the plaintiff and defendant to be equally credible.</P1>
<P1>b. Judge Bychok awarded Mr. Vachon 10% damages, without request for such from the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>c. Judge Bychok makes a demeaning and inaccurate statement in paragraph 35 of his decision, stating &ldquo;[during mediation] But, Mr. Scholz was determined to litigate.&rdquo; During mediation, Mr. Scholz made an offer less than Mr. Vachon's, and Mr. Vachon refused to take less than the full amount. Judge Bychok would have had access to the mediation records. That he makes an inaccurate statement on something so straightforward is indicative of a biased mindset.</P1>
<P1>d. Judge Bychok states that Mr. Scholz exhibited poor judgment in land skills. This is not within his expertise to say. Survival principles include staying on well-worn paths, and staying in places where you can be seen, and staying as close to settlements as possible if anything seems amiss. Peter Scholz followed these principles, and survived as a result.</P1>
<P1>e. After spending a fair portion of his decision stating that Mr. Scholz had poor judgment, he says that all that is irrelevant anyway and only contractual law is relevant.</P1>
<P1>f. Judge Bychok did not question the plaintiff about whether he had liability insurance, what proper business practices are in these sorts of situations, or if the plaintiff made all efforts to communicate with Mr. Scholz to reduce the time of search activities, or if Mr. Bychok even had any clients the day that he supposedly lost revenue. Judge Bychok also did not ask the plaintiff whether he advises his other clients to not bring extra fuel, and if not, why not. These are the sort of logical and simple steps and fact-findings that Canadians can expect judicial professionals to undertake in order to arrive at fair judgments.</P1>
<P1>g. Judge Bychok did not ask the plaintiff if he had adjusted his rental policies because of this event, or was encouraging clients to bring additional gas, or if he felt any empathy for pain and suffering endured by the defendant and his family as a result of the event.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 3&mdash;POINTS OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiff did not truthfully represent the vehicle being rented. The defendant used the vehicle according to the specifications described by the plaintiff. The existing judgment did not take this into account. When renting from a licensed company in Canada, clients should be able to presume that the products they are renting will function as described.
<P1>If someone rents a car, and the car breaks down on a highway and is rear-ended, the rental agency will not then sue the renter for the car breaking down.</P1></P>
<P>2. Judge Bychok ignored inconsistencies in the story of the plaintiff in reaching his decision. This includes clear evidence that the Qairrulik employee was lying to a judge during a Court of Law.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 4&mdash;NATURE OF RELIEF DESIRED</TI>
<P>That the amount owing be reduced to the amount of gas used by the defendant during the rental, about $100.</P>
<P>That the plaintiff be advised to revise their business practices to reduce risks to clients and to accurately describe their rental products to clients.</P></BLOCK1>
