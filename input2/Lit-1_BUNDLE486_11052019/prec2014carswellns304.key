<P>I Daniel Rozon CA, CIRP, Trustee in bankruptcy hereby make oath and say:
<P1>1. I am a Senior Vice-President, a Chartered Accountant and Trustee in Bankruptcy with Grant Thornton Limited (&ldquo;GT&rdquo;) and the information on which this Affidavit is based is from the documents obtained from and discussions with Joseph Edward Hendsbee;</P1>
<P1>2. Green Hunt Wedlake Inc. (predecessor firm of GT) was the Trustee in the bankruptcy of Joseph Edward Hendsbee (&ldquo;Hendsbee&rdquo;) filed on May 11, 2004 and GT is the Administrator of the Consumer Proposal of Hendsbee filed on March 28, 2013;</P1>
<P1>3. Hendsbee was a self-employed flooring installer/carpenter for approximately 14 years until September 2012 at which time he became an employee of D. Procure Construction (&ldquo;Procure&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>4. Hendsbee is a single father supporting two young children aged 5 and 4 years old. His estranged wife has no contact with him or the children. He receives no support from his estranged wife.</P1>
<P1>5. He earns $15.00 per hour as shown on the payslip attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>. Income tax and other deductions are now being taken directly from his pay cheque as noted in the same exhibit;</P1>
<P1>6. In &ldquo;good weeks&rdquo; his puts in 40 hours of work for Procure but on average it is much lower, especially during the winter months;</P1>
<P1>7. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is the Income and Expense Statement Hendsbee submitted with his Consumer Proposal. The available monthly income of the family unit is $1,000 after child care expenses.</P1>
<P1>8. The guideline according to the Surplus Income Standards issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (OSB) for a family of three persons is $3,070. Hendsbee's family unit income is substantially below the guideline.</P1></P>

<P><P1>9. Hendsbee's sole creditor in the bankruptcy filed on May 11, 2004 was Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) in the amount of $64,764.</P1>
<P1>10. Hendsbee was granted a Conditional Order of Discharge on October 1, 2005 requiring him to pay $7,200 and file his 2004, 2005 and 2006 income tax and H ST returns and pay the amounts due for those years. A copy of the Conditional Order of Discharge is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>11. Hendsbee paid the amount of $7,200 to the bankrupt estate as required in the Conditional Order of Discharge but did not deliver proof that his 2004, 2005 and 2006 income tax and HST returns had been filled or paid;</P1>
<P1>12. Green Hunt Wedlake Inc./Grant Thornton Limited was discharged as Trustee to the bankruptcy on December 29, 2008.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Years subsequent to the May 2004 Bankruptcy</TI>
<P><P1>13. By his own admission Hendsbee has told GT that he was not diligent in filing his income tax and HST returns when he was self-employed;</P1>
<P1>14. Hendsbee has advised GT of the following:
<P2>a. CRA issued arbitrary income tax and HST assessments for the years 2004 to 2008 and possibly for some of the subsequent years;</P2>
<P2>b. Hendsbee believes that he filed tax returns for certain years after 2004, including 2010, 2011 and 2012;</P2>
<P2>c. From 2004 to 2012, his main source of revenue was from work as a sub-contractor for Vintage Hardwood Floors (&ldquo;Vintage&rdquo;);</P2>
<P2>d. The gross amount he was receiving from Vintage was approximately $50,000 per year (which was at least 95% of his gross income before business expenses);</P2>
<P2>e. For a period of at least 3 years there was an outstanding Requirement To Pay served on Vintage by CRA;</P2>
<P2>f. CRA was paid 40% of the gross amount payable to Hendsbee for at least 3 years which represents a total of approximately $60,000 (40% &times; $50,000 &times; 3 years) by Vintage during that time period. The total actual amount could be substantially more;</P2>
<P2>g. His business related expenses were approximately $15,000 per year; therefore his net yearly taxable income was approximately $35,000 ($50,000 less 15,000). Using an effective tax rate of 20% Hensdbee would have owed approximately $7,000 a year in taxes.</P2>
<P2>h. He has further advised that he has few or no remaining records for the years 2004 to 2008;</P2></P1>
<P1>15. As an experienced Chartered Accountant, I am of the opinion that it would cost at least several thousand dollars to reconstitute Hendsbee's accounting records and prepare 6&ndash;9 years of income tax and HST returns and reconcile those with the arbitrary assessments issued by CRA. Based on his current income, Hendsbee cannot afford to pay an accountant to perform that work.</P1>
<P1>16. Based on the above, I am of the opinion that it is reasonable to conclude the following:
<P2>a. Any taxes Hendsbee would have owed for 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been paid by virtue of the payments made by Vintage to CRA under the Requirement to Pay;</P2>
<P2>b. Based on more than 30 years in practice as a Chartered Accountant and a Trustee in bankruptcy, it is my experience that when CRA issues arbitrary assessments, those assessments tend to be significantly higher compared to the returns which should normally have been filed by a taxpayer, for the following reasons: gross income is usually over estimated; no provision is made for tax deductible business expenses; minimal or no provision are made for tax credits; and no credits are taken when estimating HST.</P2>
<P2>c. The arbitrary assessments issued by CRA for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 are tantamount to Hendsbee having filed the returns for those years;</P2>
<P2>d. If Hendsbee could afford to pay an accountant to reconstitute his records from 2004 to 2008 and submit accurate returns, it is plausible and highly probable that Hendsbee has overpaid his taxes to CRA for that period of time and would actually be due a significant refund;</P2></P1>
<P1>17. Based on paragraph 16 above, it is reasonable to conclude that Hendsbee has fulfilled the remaining conditions of his Conditional Order of Discharge and should have been granted an Absolute Order of Discharge.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Consumer Proposal</TI>
<P><P1>18. On March 8, 2013, CRA issued a new Requirement to Pay to Daniel Procure, Hendsbee's employer, for an amount of $20,024. A copy is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>. That amount has now increased to $99,247 as per <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>19. Hendsbee's only creditor in his Consumer Proposal was CRA;</P1>
<P1>20. GT has not investigated the source of the tax owing but it is probably a balance of amounts due under the arbitrary assessments of 2004 to 2008 and subsequent returns Hendsbee filed prior to becoming an employee of Procure in 2012.</P1>
<P1>21. As indicated in paragraph 28 above, Hendsbee probably did not owe money to CRA when he filed his Consumer Proposal but he cannot afford to have proper income tax and HST returns prepared;</P1>
<P1>22. Hendsbee filed a Consumer Proposal with GT on March 28, 2013, a copy of which is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>23. GT's position was that based on the conclusion reached in paragraph 16 above, Hendsbee had complied with the Conditional Order of Discharge in his bankruptcy and was entitled to file a Consumer Proposal;</P1>
<P1>24. As Administrator, GT issued several Notices of Stay of Proceedings to CRA and to Procure regarding the March 2013 Requirement to Pay;</P1>
<P1>25. There is a difference of opinion between GT, CRA and the OSB as to whether Hendsbee was entitled to file a Consumer Proposal, That debate is now moot because Hendsbee is in default of his Consumer Proposal and he does not have sufficient income to make payments due to his family obligations.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P><P1>26. Hendsbee is the sole provider of 2 young children and is not receiving support from his estranged wife. He has very limited income and the family unit income is substantially below the OSB surplus income guidelines for a family of 3 persons and would not have the means to comply with the outstanding issues of the Conditional Order of Discharge;</P1>
<P1>27. Hendsbee needs the relief offered by a second bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act;</P1>
<P1>28. As stated in paragraph 16 above, GT's position is that Hendsbee has complied with the outstanding terms of the Conditional Order of Discharge.</P1></P>
<P>I make this this affidavit in support of the Application for Directions by GT of April 1, 2014 and for no improper purpose.</P>
<P><BOLD>DATED</BOLD> at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of April, 2014.</P>

<P>Please accept the following as the written submissions of the Canada Revenue Agency in relation to the above matter.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">Introduction and Background</TI>
<P>Grant Thornton Limited, the trustee, filed an application requesting directions from the Court regarding the terms of discharge for the Bankrupt. Daniel Rozon of Grant Thornton has advised that the application will proceed as a motion to modify the terms of the existing conditional order for discharge. The Canada Revenue Agency has agreed to proceeding with the motion to modify.</P>
<P>The October 14, 2005 conditional order for discharge (&ldquo;Discharge Order&rdquo;) requires the Bankrupt to tax returns for 2004, 2005 and 2006 and to make payment of amounts due in order to obtain an absolute discharge.</P>
<P>The Bankrupt assigned himself into bankruptcy on May 13, 2004 and subsequently filed a proposal in March 2013, which was voted down by CRA as the only creditor. The Bankrupt was an undischarged bankrupt at the time the proposal was filed and he remained an undischarged bankrupt when the proposal was voted down.</P>
<P>The Bankrupt's tax liability for 2004, 2005 and 2006 is post-bankruptcy debt that is not encompassed by the current bankruptcy. The terms of the October 14, 2005 Discharge Order cannot be modified to address the Bankrupt's post-bankruptcy tax liability pursuant to the Trustee's motion.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">Issues</TI>
<P>The issues to be addressed in relation to the Trustee's motion to modify the Discharge Order are as follows:
<P1><BOLD>(a)</BOLD> whether the affidavits filed by the Trustee and Bankrupt are admissible as evidence;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>(b)</BOLD> whether the bankrupt is subject to a proposal pursuant to the BIA;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>(c)</BOLD> whether the Discharge Order can be modified to discharge the bankrupt from his tax liability for 2004, 2005 and 2006;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>(d)</BOLD> whether this Court has jurisdiction to make a finding in relation to the validity of an assessment of tax in modifying the Discharge Order;</P1>
<P1><BOLD>(e)</BOLD> whether the Bankrupt has established that there is no reasonable probability of his being able to comply with the terms of the conditional discharge order as issued.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">Affidavits</TI>
<P>The Affidavit of Daniel Rozon (&ldquo;Rozon Affidavit&rdquo;), dated April 1, 2014, does not comply with Rule 39 of the <EM>Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules</EM>, Rule 39&mdash;TAB 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (&ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) and should be partially inadmissible as evidence in this motion.</P>
<P>Rule 39.04<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Civil Procedure Rules, <EM>supra</EM>&mdash;TAB 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> states that an affidavit containing information that is not admissible evidence or that is not appropriate to the affidavit can be struck by the Court. The rule further provides that irrelevant statements, submissions or pleas are not admissible information and that if the parts to be struck leaves the affidavit difficult to understand, the whole affidavit may be struck. Rule 39.05 states that a party who files a scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive affidavit is subject to Rule 88 regarding abuse of process.</P>
<P>Paragraph 15 of the Rozon Affidavit is opinion and appears to be couched in terms of an expert opinion given the statement &ldquo;As an experienced Chartered Accountant...&rdquo;. It is noted that the procedure for the introduction of expert opinion, as provided for in Rule 55, has not been followed. Similarly, paragraph 16 of the Rozon Affidavit is opinion and includes irrelevant statements and submissions. Paragraph 17 is based on paragraph 16 and also includes irrelevant statements and submissions.</P>
<P>Paragraph 20 of the Rozon Affidavit is opinion, contains irrelevant statements and submissions and is qualified by the statement &ldquo;GT has not investigated...&rdquo;. Paragraphs 21, 23, 25, 26, 27 and 28 also contain irrelevant statements and submissions.</P>
<P>As a result, paragraph 15 to 17, 20, 21, 23, 25 and 26 to 28 of the Rozon Affidavit should be struck as inadmissible pursuant to Rule 39.</P>
<P>The Affidavit of the Bankrupt, dated April 8, 2014 states at paragraph 4 that he &ldquo;...agrees with the conclusions in paragraphs 26 to 28 of Mr. Rozon's Affidavit...&rdquo;. This paragraph contains irrelevant statements and submissions and relies on paragraphs in the Rozon Affidavit which should be struck. Similarly, paragraph 5 of the Affidavit contains submissions rather than evidence.</P>
<P>Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Affidavit of the Bankrupt should be struck as inadmissible pursuant to Rule 39.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">Proposal</TI>
<P>Pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(d) of the BIA, a bankrupt can make a proposal. Section 58 provides, however, that the trustee can only apply to the Court for approval upon the acceptance of the proposal by the creditors. Section 61 of the BIA provides that only the approval by the Court of a proposal made after bankruptcy operates to annul the bankruptcy.</P>
<P>On March 28, 2013, the Bankrupt made a consumer proposal in which CRA was the only creditor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Rozon Affidavit, paras. 19, 22, Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no evidence that CRA voted in favour of the proposal nor that an application was made to the Court in support of the proposal. The assignment filed by the Bankrupt in October 2005, which is subject to the Discharge Order sought to be modified by this motion, has not be annulled nor has there been any change in the Bankrupt's date of bankruptcy for the purposes of determining his pre and post-bankruptcy liabilities.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">Discharge from Post-Bankruptcy Liability</TI>
<P>The Bankrupt's tax liability for 2004, 2005 and 2006 is post-bankruptcy debt. The Discharge Order requires that the Court to be satisfied that:
<QUOTE><P>... the Bankrupt files and pays amount due on his <UNDER><EM>post bankruptcy 2004, 2005 and 2006</EM></UNDER> income tax and HST returns... [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
in order for the Bankrupt to obtain an Absolute Order of Discharge. The Discharge Order specifically states that the tax liability for 2004, 2005 and 2006 is post-bankruptcy debt. The failure to meet this condition leaves the Bankrupt undischarged until such time as the condition is met or until the Discharge Order is modified by the Court pursuant to subsection 172(3) of the BIA.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">Jurisdiction&mdash;Validity of Assessment</TI>
<P>The <EM>Income Tax</EM> Act (ITA), and similarly the <EM>Excise Tax Act</EM>, are complete codes with respect to the filing of tax returns and the assessment of tax liability. Subject to specific limited exceptions, all persons earning income in Canada are required to file an income tax return in which an estimate of the tax owing in indicated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA, ss. 150(1) and 150(1.1), s. 151&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>Once a return has been filed, the Minister of National Revenue (&ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) is mandated to assess the return and to send a notice of assessment to the taxpayer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA ss. 152(2)&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The taxpayer's liability for tax is not, however, dependant on an assessment. The liability to pay tax accrues as income is earned whether an assessment has been made or not.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA ss. 152(3)&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>Subsection 152(7) of ITA states that the Minister is not bound by a return or information supplied by or on behalf of a taxpayer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA ss. 152(7)&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Minister is entitled to accept or reject factual assertions contained in an individual's report on income and is entitled to assess, notwithstanding the return or the fact that no return has been filed.</P>
<P>The ITA states that the Minister alone shall issue assessments and makes such assessments binding, subject to an objection or an appeal under the ITA:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>152.</N><SSEC><N>(8)</N><TI>Assessment deemed valid and binding</TI><SSECP><UNDER><EM>An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment be deemed to be valid and binding</EM></UNDER> notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto... [emphasis added]</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>The only option for a taxpayer to dispute an assessment issued by the Minister is to file an objection.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA ss. 165(1)&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The objection process involves a review of the assessment by a CRA officer who can either confirm, vary or rescind the assessment. After having filed an objection, the taxpayer may appeal the assessment to the Tax Court of Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>ITA ss. 169(1)&mdash;TAB 6</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>The exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court in relation to appeals of assessments of tax is set out in section 12 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM> (&ldquo;TCCA&rdquo;):
<QUOTE><SEC><N>12.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine references and appeals to the Court on matters arising under...Part IX of the ETA, the ITA,...when references or appeals to the Court are provided for in those Acts.</SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>This Court is without jurisdiction to inquire behind an assessment issued pursuant to the ITA. Many courts in this country have considered this issue and have repeatedly declined to make inquiry behind an assessment issued by the Minister:
<QUOTE><P>In this case the chambers judge assumed jurisdiction to decide the validity of the very assessments on which the CRA based its claims...He erred in concluding that he had jurisdiction to determine what amounts were payable to CRA, simply because he was considering a motion seeking the summary determination of entitlement to funds paid into the court on an interpleader. <UNDER><EM>He purported to decide a matter that is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada</EM></UNDER>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Aboriginal Federated Alliance v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2002 ABCA 104</CITE><PARANUM>15&ndash;19</PARANUM></CASEREF>&mdash;TAB 1; <CASEREF><SOC>422252 Alberta Limited v.

The claim was supported by a notice of assessment. The trustee was not satisfied with the notice of claim and asked for more information including the working papers prepared to establish the amounts owing by the company of which the bankrupt was a director.</P>
<P>Both the Deputy Registrar and the reviewing Justice agreed with the trustee's disallowance of the Crown claim and held that the proof of claim and notice of assessment were not sufficient for the trustee to discharge his duties and the total disallowance of the claim was appropriate. A unanimous Ontario Court of Appeal disagreed with the Trustee, the Deputy Registrar and the reviewing Justice and held:
<QUOTE><P>(a) the requirement for evidence to support the claim was fully answered by the Notice of Assessment;</P>
<P>(b) <UNDER><EM>if the trustee questions an assessment, he must seek his remedy within the ITA</EM></UNDER>; and</P>
<P>(c) no trustee can disallow an assessment and no interpretation of the BIA can clothe the trustee with jurisdiction that is reserved to the Tax Court.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Norris</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, paras. 5 to 7&mdash;TAB 3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>There is ample jurisprudence to demonstrate that courts, other than the Tax Court of Canada must defer to the Minister in relation to matters of assessment. In addition, the BIA confers no jurisdiction on this court to inquire behind or challenge the findings of the Minister regarding an assessment of tax liability.</P>
<P>As the Bankrupt has not filed tax returns for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 taxation years, the assessments of those taxation years as pursuant to subsection 152(7) of the ITA are determinative of his tax liability for those year in the absence of an objection or an appeal before the Tax Court of Canada.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VII">Compliance with Discharge Order</TI>
<P>The onus is on the Bankrupt, in a motion pursuant to subsection 172(3) of the BIA to modify the terms of a conditional discharge order, to establish that there is no reasonable probability of his being able to comply with the terms of the order as issued.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re McKeage</SOC><CITE>2003 ABQB 213</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>&mdash;TAB 4</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>The factors considered by the Court in making a decision to modify the terms of the conditional order are as follows:
<P1>(a) any change in circumstances of the bankrupt that have occurred since the order was issued and whether the changes were within the control of the bankrupt;</P1>
<P1>(b) materials, other than income and expense statements, showing that the bankrupt cannot comply with the terms of the order;</P1>
<P1>(c) the credibility of the bankrupt; and</P1>
<P1>(d) evidence concerning the efforts that the bankrupt has made to comply with the terms of the conditional order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Appleby</SOC><YEAR>2001</YEAR><CITE>27 C.B.R. (4th) 1</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2001 CanLII 28476</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CORRELAT><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>additional reasons</CASEDISP><CASEREF><YEAR>2001</YEAR><CITE>2001 CarswellOnt 3002</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SCJ</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>&mdash;TAB 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>An adverse finding on anyone of the above four factors can be grounds for the Court to deny the motion requesting modification to the conditional discharge order.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Re Appleby</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, para. 11&mdash;TAB 5</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>There is no evidence of the Bankrupt having not been able to comply with the condition that he file returns and remit payment for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 taxation year nor of the Bankrupt having made any effort to comply with those conditions. Similarly, there is no evidence of a change in circumstances that was out of the control of the Bankrupt that prevented him from filing the tax returns and remitting payment. Rather than filing returns to the best of his ability with the information available to him, the Bankrupt did not file returns for those years. The Bankrupt has not established, therefore, that there is no reasonable probability of his being able to comply with the terms of the order as issued.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VIII">Conclusion</TI>
<P>The Canada Revenue Agency opposes the motion to modify the terms of the October 2005 Discharge Order and asks that the Court deny the relief sought.</P>
