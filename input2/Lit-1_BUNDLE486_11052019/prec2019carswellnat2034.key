<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>REASSESSMENTS UNDER APPEAL</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. Total Energy Services Inc, (&ldquo;TESI&rdquo;) appeals from Notices of Reassessment issued by the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) on August 27, 2015, with respect to the 2010 and 2011 taxation years (the &ldquo;Reassessments&rdquo;) under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (Canada) (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. TESI served Notices of Objection (the &ldquo;Objections&rdquo;) to each of the Reassessments on the Minister in a timely fashion on or about October 22, 2015.</P>
<P>4. More than 90 days have elapsed since the date the Objections were served. The Minister has not notified TESI that the Reassessments have been vacated or confirmed, nor has the Minister issued a further reassessment in respect of either the 2010 or 2011 taxation year. Accordingly, TESI brings this appeal pursuant to paragraph 169(1)(b) of the Act.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>MATERIAL FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. TESI is a taxable Canadian corporation as defined in subsection 89(1) of the Act. TESI is the successor by amalgamation of Total Energy Services Ltd. (&ldquo;TESL&rdquo;) and Total Energy Services Inc. (&ldquo;New Total&rdquo;). New Total was the successor to Biomerge Industries Ltd. (&ldquo;Biomerge&rdquo;) by name change.</P>
<P>6. TESI is the ultimate successor of the conversion of the Total Energy Services Trust from a trust to a corporation, which conversion occurred on May 20, 2009 pursuant to a plan of arrangement.</P>
<P>7. TESI is a body corporate which at all relevant times had a fiscal year-end of December 31. It carries on the business, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, of the provision of contract drilling services, the rental and transportation of surface equipment used in oil and natural gas drilling and production processes and the manufacturing, sale, rental and servicing of natural gas compression and process equipment to oil and gas exploration and production companies in western Canada and internationally.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Total Conversion</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Conversion Required by Change of Law</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>8. On October 31, 2006, the Minister of Finance (&ldquo;Finance&rdquo;) announced its intention to &ldquo;level the playing field between income trusts and corporations&rdquo; by proposing a distribution tax on specified investment flow through trusts (&ldquo;SIFT&rdquo;). These proposals became law on June 22, 2007 (the &ldquo;SIFT Rules&rdquo;) and, subject to adhering to the normal growth guidelines, applied to certain trusts commencing in 2011.</P>
<P>9. The SIFT Rules effectively required that a SIFT convert to a corporation by December 31, 2010 or be subject to a new distribution tax and limitations on future growth.</P>
<P>10. On July 14, 2008, Finance introduced comprehensive draft legislation which permitted a mutual fund trust to convert to a corporation on a tax-deferred basis (the &ldquo;Conversion Rules&rdquo;). The Conversion Rules became law and provided two methods to convert from a trust to a corporation&mdash;namely, the &ldquo;exchange method&rdquo; or the &ldquo;distribution method&rdquo;.</P>
<P>11. The Conversion Rules did not place limitations with respect to the corporation that could be used to undertake the conversion nor did they specify a rule that would deem control of a corporation to have been acquired in relation to the exchange method.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Conversion by Plan of Arrangement</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>12. Total Energy Services Trust (&ldquo;Total Trust&rdquo;) was an unincorporated open ended trust governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and created pursuant to a deed of trust dated March 23, 2005 between Olympia Trust Company and TESL. At all relevant times, Total Trust was a &ldquo;mutual fund trust&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.</P>
<P>13. Total Trust's units were listed and posted for trading on the TSX from May 2005 until May 2009 when, pursuant to a reorganization, the units ceased trading. Until completion of such reorganization, Total Trust's business was conducted through a number of direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TESL and Bidell Equipment Limited Partnership (&ldquo;Bidell LP&rdquo;).</P>
<P>14. Total Energy Services Commercial Trust (the &ldquo;SubTrust&rdquo;) was an unincorporated trust established pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta. Sub-Trust was a &ldquo;unit trust&rdquo; as described in subsection 108(2) of the Act. All of Sub-Trust's units were owned by Total Trust. Prior to being wound up, the SubTrust held a 86% partnership interest in Bidell LP while Total Trust held a 14% partnership interest in Bidell LP.</P>
<P>15. TESL was a corporation which between April 29, 2005 and May 20, 2009, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total Trust. From May 20, 2009 to December 31, 2009, TESL was a subsidiary of Biomerge Industries Ltd., which on May 20, 2009 changed its name to Total Energy Services Inc. (herein &ldquo;New Total&rdquo;).</P>
<P>16. Total Trust was a SIFT under the SIFT Rules and Total Trust determined that to avoid the STFT Rules it was in the best interests of Total Trust to convert into a corporation pursuant to one of the mandated methods to undertake a conversion transaction under the Conversion Rules (the &ldquo;Total Conversion&rdquo;).</P>
<P>17. The Total Conversion involved the conversion of Total Trust from an income trust to a corporate structure through a Court reviewed and approved Plan of Arrangement with Biomerge. As a result of the Total Conversion and utilisation of the &ldquo;exchange method&rdquo;, holders of Total Trust's units exchanged their units for shares of New Total and Total Trust was wound-up. On May 27, 2009, the New Total shares commenced trading on the TSX under the symbol &ldquo;TOT&rdquo;.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER><EM>Court Approval of the Plan of Arrangement</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>18. On March 19, 2009, Total Trust, TESL and Biomcrge entered into an agreement (the &ldquo;Arrangement Agreement&rdquo;), subsequently amended and restated April 15, 2009. Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, among other things, Total Trust was to be converted from an income trust to a corporation pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under Section 193 of the <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM> (Alberta) (the &ldquo;Plan of Arrangement&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ABCA&rdquo;),</P>
<P>19. The Arrangement Agreement was entered into by Total Trust and TESL having regard to the SIFT Rules as well as the economic and industry environment at the lime and their future growth plans. In addition to avoiding the application of the SIFT Rules, the corporate structure arising from the Arrangement Agreement was anticipated to achieve a number of business objectives, including, among other things, improving access to capital markets, facilitating Total Trust/TESL's ongoing international expansion and a simplified and more efficient corporate structure.</P>
<P>20. On May 15, 2009, the Plan of Arrangement was approved on a final basis by order of the Honourable Justice G.C. Hawco of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench (the &ldquo;Final Order&rdquo;).</P>
<P>21. On May 20, 2009 pursuant to the Final Order, which incorporated Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the Arrangement Agreement, the following events occurred in the order set forth below:
<P1>(a) the Total Trust Deed of Trust was amended to (i) enable the Total Trust units to be transferred to Biomerge, and (ii) facilitate the arrangement and the implementation of the steps and transactions contemplated under the Plan of Arrangement;</P1>
<P1>(b) the articles of continuance of Biomerge were amended to provide for the creation of the New Total Common Shares as a new class of shares of Biomerge;</P1>
<P1>(c) Total Trust deposited with Bennett Jones LLP, in trust, $1,271,401, an amount equal to Biomerge's liabilities and Biomerge issued to Total Trust a demand promissory note in the same amount;</P1>
<P1>(d) the 29,050,000 outstanding Total Trust units were transferred to Biomerge in exchange for 29,050,000 Biomerge (New Total) Common Shares on a tax-deferred basis pursuant to subsections 85.1(7) and (8) of the Act;</P1>
<P1>(e) the 248,941,152 outstanding Biomerge voting common shares were transferred to Biomerge for cancellation in exchange for; (i) 56,730 New Total Common Shares, and (ii) $702,293 cash consideration;</P1>
<P1>(f) the 435,647,055 outstanding Biomerge noil-voting shares were transferred to Biomerge in exchange for cash consideration of $1,695,185;</P1>
<P1>(g) Biomerge changed its name to Total Energy Services Inc. (&ldquo;New Total&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(h) the by-laws of TESL became the by-laws of New Total;</P1>
<P1>(i) the directors of TESL replaced the existing directors of Biomerge;</P1>
<P1>(j) the officers of TESL replaced the existing officers of Biomerge.</P1></P>
<P>22. On May 20, 2009, subsequent to the Plan of Arrangement but not pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, the following transactions, among others, occurred:
<P1>(a) the Sub-Trust was wound up into Total Trust on a tax deferred basis pursuant to subsection 88.1(2) of the Act;</P1>
<P1>(h) the Total Trust was wound-up into New Total on a tax-deferred basis pursuant to Subsection 88.1(2) of the Act.</P1></P>
<P>23. As a result of the wind-ups, all of the assets of Total Trust were distributed to New Total.</P>
<P>24. On January 1, 2010 New Total and TESL amalgamated on a tax deferred basis pursuant to section 87 of the Act with the ongoing business operating under the name Total Energy Services Inc. (herein &ldquo;TESI&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Previous Creditors Company Arrangement Act Transactions</TI>
<P>25. Biomerge was a corporation continued under the ABCA. It was previously known as Xillix Technologies Corp. (&ldquo;Xillix&rdquo;) but changed its name to Biomerge on September 24, 2007.</P>
<P>26. Cavalon Capital Partners Ltd. (&ldquo;Cavalon&rdquo;) was a private, Calgary-based investment corporation. At all times Cavalon and its principles were arm's length with TESI, TESL, Total Trusl and all related persons.</P>
<P>27. On October 23, 2006, as a result of the demand letter from a secured creditor, Xillix sought and obtained an Order of the British Columbia Supreme Court (the &ldquo;Court&rdquo;) granting it protection from creditors under the <EM>Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act</EM> (the &ldquo;CCAA&rdquo;). The Court order gave Xillix an opportunity to develop a reorganization plan, thereby providing Xillix with an opportunity to maximize value for its stakeholders.</P>
<P>28. The initial Order of the Court was extended multiple times. The extension of the initial Order provided Xillix with more time to develop and implement a reorganisation plan.</P>
<P>29. On June 21, 2007, Xillix submitted to the Court its Flan of Compromise and Arrangement (the &ldquo;Restructuring Plan&rdquo;) under the CCAA.</P>
<P>30. On July 9, 2007, Xillix entered into an agreement (the &ldquo;Investment Agreement&rdquo;) with Cavalon. Cavalon agreed to make an investment of $4,400,000 in Xillix, structured as a non-interest bearing loan with $4,160,000 being convertible into voting and non-voting common shares in the capital of Xillix.</P>
<P>31. On September 13, 2007, Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Cavalon from its shareholders. The purchase price was $333,390 and was satisfied by the issuance of 1,666,950 common shares of Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd., at a price of $0.20 per share.</P>
<P>32. On September 18, 2007, Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. and Cavalon amalgamated to form new Nexia (referred to herein as &ldquo;Nexia&rdquo;), which became Cavalon's successor in interest to the Investment Agreement.</P>
<P>33. On September 24, 2007, the Restructuring Plan was completed. Pursuant to the Restructuring Plan, the following, among other things, occurred.
<ITEM><P>Nexia subscribed for a non-interest bearing convertible note in the amount of $4,400,000 in Xiliix (the &ldquo;Convertible Note&rdquo;);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>$3.6 million (of the $4.4 million) was used by Xillix to settle its creditors' claims;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Xillix's authorized share capital was increased by creating an unlimited number of non-voting shares and an unlimited number of preferred shares;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Approximately 94.5% (or $4,160,000) of the Convertible Note was converted into 112,023,510 common shares and 435,647,055 non-voting shares of Xillix;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Xillix changed its name to Biomerge; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>On September 26, 2007 Biomerge's shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and listed on the NEX, under the symbol &ldquo;BIL.H&rdquo;. The non-voting shares were not listed.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>34. After the Restructuring Plan was completed:
<P1>(i) Nexia held approximately 45% of Biomerge's common shares, then issued and outstanding; and</P1>
<P1>(ii) Nexia held approximately 100% of Biomerge's non-voting shares then issued and outstanding.</P1></P>
<P>35. The matters referred to in paragraphs 29 to 33 above are collectively referred to as the CCAA Plan Transactions.</P>
<P>36. At December 31, 2007, Biomerge had 248,941,152 voting common shares and 435,647,055 non-voting shares issued and outstanding. The common shares and nonvoting shares ranked equally as to dividend rights and rights on liquidation and the nonvoting were convertible to common shares on a one-to-one basis.</P>
<P>37. At the end of December 31, 2008, Biomerge had the following tax attributes:
<P1>(a) non-capital losses of $49,206,127;</P1>

<P1>(c) an undeducted investment tax credit (ITC) of $1,717,117 (attributed to scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED) expenditures);</P1>
<P1>(d) an available SR&amp;ED expenditure pool of $23,229,238;</P1>
<P1>In addition, its wholly owned subsidiary, Xillix Imaging Ltd. had the following tax attributes:</P1>
<P1>(e) non-capital losses in the amount of $2,473,258.</P1>

<P1>(d) available SR&amp;ED expenditure pool of $23,229,238.</P1></P>
<P>40. At the end of December 31, 2009, TESL had the following tax attributes:
<P1>(a) non-capital losses of $19,321,810; and</P1>
<P1>(b) undeductcd ITC of $3,212 (attributed to SR&amp;ED expenditures).</P1></P>
<P>41. On January 1, 2010, New Total and TESL amalgamated on a tax deferred basis under section 87 of the Act, with the ongoing business operating under the name TESI. Pursuant to the amalgamation, the tax pools of New Total and TESL became the tax pools of TESI. Accordingly, TESI had the following tax pools on January 1, 2010, which included the remaining unutilized Tax Attributes:
<P1>(a) non-capital losses of $48,397,392;</P1>
<P1>(b) capital loss carry-forward of $2,632,626;</P1>

<P>42. The income tax return for TESI for its taxation year ending December 31, 2010 was filed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

<P>43. At the end of December 31, 2010, TESI had the following tax pools, which included the remaining unutilized Tax Attributes:

<P1>(d) available SR&amp;ED expenditure pool of $23,229,238.</P1></P>
<P>44. The income tax return for TEST for its taxation year ending December 31, 2011 was filed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

<P1>(b) capital loss carry-forward of $1,937,778; and</P1>
<P1>(c) undeducted ITC of $1,720,329 (attributed to SR&amp;ED expenditures).</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The Reassessments</TI>
<P>46. The Minister reassessed TESl's taxation year ending December 31, 2010 by disallowing the deduction of non-capital losses of prior years in the amount of $2,878,871.</P>
<P>47. The Minister reassessed TESI's taxation year ending December 31, 2011 by:
<P1>(a) Disallowing non-capital losses from prior years in the amount of $26,196,711;</P1>
<P1>(b) Disallowing capital losses from prior years in the amount of $694,848 (being net capital losses of $347,424); and</P1>
<P1>(c) Disallowing the deduction of SR&amp;ED expenditures previously incurred in the amount of $23,229,238.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>Basis of Reassessment</TI>
<P>48. By letter dated April 13, 2015 (the &ldquo;First Proposal Letter&rdquo;), the Minister proposed to reassess on the basis that TESI (and its predecessors) were not entitled to utilize the Tax Attributes in the calculation of taxable income, based on the following position:
<P1>(a) That for the purposes of section 245 of the Act a &ldquo;tax benefit&rdquo; arose by virtue of the non-impairment of the Tax Attributes;</P1>
<P1>(b) That for the purposes of section 245 of the Act that the relevant &ldquo;series of transactions&rdquo; included not only the Total Conversion but also the CCAA Plan Transactions as well as certain post Total Conversion transactions and certain of the transactions within the &ldquo;series of transactions&rdquo; were not undertaken &ldquo;primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit&rdquo; and thus were avoidance transaction(s) for the purposes of section 245; and</P1>
<P1>(c) That the purported avoidance transaction(s) constituted an abuse of the Act read as a whole.</P1></P>
<P>49. In a subsequent letter dated July 9, 2015 (the &ldquo;Second Proposal Letter&rdquo;) the Minister restated its position to be that the CCAA Plan Transactions were distinguishable from the Total Conversion and any post Total Conversion transactions, however that section 245 of the Act applied to the CCAA Plan Transactions so as to determine the Tax Attributes of Biomerge (after the CCAA Plan Transactions) to be nil. In the alternative it relied on its position as set out in the First Proposal Letter.</P>
<P>50. Although the Reassessments purported to disallow the Tax Attributes. In fact, in reassessing, the Minister disallowed an amount inaddition to the Tax Attributes of $24,668. This additional amount arose because of the Minister's mistaken assumption that a corporation, 33599 Yukon Ltd., was a subsidiary of Biomerge when in fact it was not (the CRA reassessed amounts collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Disputed Amounts&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI><UNDER>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</UNDER></TI>
<P>51. The issues to be decided are:
<P1>(a) Whether section 245 of the Act applies to the CCAA Plan Transactions so as to result in the denial of the use of any of the Tax Attributes claimed by the Appellant;</P1>
<P1>(b) Whether section 245 of the Act applies to the Total Conversion so as to result in the denial of the use of any of the Tax Attributes claimed by the Appellant;</P1>
<P1>(c) Whether section 245 of the Act applies collectively to the CCAA Plan Transaction and Total Conversion so as to result in the denial of the use of any of the Tax Attributes claimed by the Appellant; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Whether the Reassessments were issued outside the &ldquo;normal reassessment period&rdquo; as defined in the Act such that the issuance of the Reassessments is statute-barred under the Act or arc otherwise outside the limitation period, as applicable in the Province of Alberta or federally, such that the Minister is estopped from issuing the Reassessments.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>E.</N><TI><UNDER>STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELIED UPON</UNDER></TI>
<P>52. The Appellant intends to rely upon, <EM>inter alia</EM>, Parts I, XVI and XVII of the Act, including sections 37, 85, 87, 88, 111, 127, 152, 169, 245, 248, 251 and 256.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>F.</N><TI><UNDER>REASONS THE APPELLANT INTENDS TO RELY UPON</UNDER></TI>
<P>53. The CCAA Plan Transactions and the Total Conversation do not result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit to the Appellant for the purposes of section 245 of the Act.</P>
<P>54. The Total Conversion may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit and therefore the Total Conversion does not constitute an &ldquo;avoidance transaction&rdquo; for the purposes of section 245(3) of the Act.</P>
<P>55. The CCAA Plan Transactions may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit and therefore the CCAA Plan Transactions did not constitute &ldquo;avoidance transactions&rdquo; for the purposes of section 245(3) of the Act.</P>
<P>56. There was no connection between the CCAA Plan Transactions and the Total Conversion.</P>
<P>57. The Total Conversion did not result, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of section 245 of the Act, in a misuse of any provision of the Act or an abuse having regard to the provisions of the Act, read as a whole.</P>
<P>58. The CCAA Plan Transactions did not result, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of section 245 of the Act, in a misuse of any provision of the Act or an abuse having regard to the provisions of the Act, read as a whole.</P>
<P>59. The tax consequences asserted by the Minister in the Reassessment are not reasonable in the circumstances within the meaning of subsections 245(2) and 245(5) of the Act.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>G.</N><TI><UNDER>RELIEF SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. The Appellant respectfully requests that this appeal be allowed with costs and that the Reassessments be vacated.</P>
<P>61. The Appellant also seeks as relief to amend discretionary deductions and any additional relief as may be available.</P>

<P1>q) On December 11, 2006, Mr. Matthews and Mr. Tonken, on behalf of Cavalon, submitted a proposal to acquire Xillix' tax pools for $0.055 per dollar of useable tax loss. In line with Cavalon's business, the intent was to acquire Xillix in a form such that Xillix' tax pools could subsequently be sold by Cavalon to a profitable company that was looking to shelter its taxable income.</P1>
<P1>r) As at December 31, 2006, Xillix had 136,917,642 issued and outstanding common voting shares.</P1>
<P1>s) On January 3, 2007, Cavalon submitted a revised proposal regarding Xillix (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Letter of Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;), which was accepted by Xillix on January 5, 2007.</P1>
<P1>t) Under the Letter of Agreement:
<P2>i) Cavalon offered to invest in Xillix by way of a convertible debenture (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Debenture</BOLD>&rdquo;);</P2>
<P2>ii) the amount of the Debenture was to be calculated by multiplying Xillix's useable tax losses times $0.055;</P2>
<P2>iii) the Debenture would provide that Cavalon could convert 96% of the Debenture into one or more classes of voting and nonvoting equity shares of Xillix resulting in Cavalon holding 80% of the equity shares and 45% of the voting shares of Xillix;</P2>
<P2>iv) the current shareholders of Xillix would hold 20% of the equity and 55% of the voting shares of Xillix immediately following the conversion of the Debenture;</P2>
<P2>v) the directors and officers of Xillix would resign and be replaced by nominees of Cavalon; and</P2>
<P2>vi) of the funds received by Xillix pursuant to the financing, $800,000 would be retained by Xillix to provide it with sufficient capital to maintain itself as a publicly traded company, maintain its listing on a stock exchange and combine itself with another entity that would utilize its tax pools.</P2></P1>
<P1>u) In April 2007, Mr. Matthews and Mr. Tonken were appointed to the Board of Directors of Xillix. Mr. Matthews also became the Corporate Secretary and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Xillix. Mr. Tonken became the President and CEO of Xillix.</P1>
<P1>v) On May 3, 2007, Xillix completed the sale of most of its assets consisting of all of its intellectual property, as well as substantially all of its capital assets and inventories for proceeds totalling $3 million. Thereafter, Xillix had no operating business or assets other than cash and other nominal assets.</P1>
<P1>w) On June 21, 2007, Xillix submitted its Plan of Compromise and Arrangement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Restructuring Plan</BOLD>&rdquo;) to the court under the CCAA.</P1>
<P1>x) On July 9, 2007, Xillix entered into a definitive agreement (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Cavalon Agreement</BOLD>&rdquo;) with Cavalon. Cavalon agreed to provide funds in the amount of $4,400,000 to Xillix, structured as a non-interest bearing loan with $4,160,000 being convertible into voting and non-voting common shares in the capital of Xillix (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Convertible Loan</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>y) The amount of $4.4 million was computed based on a multiple of Xillix' tax losses for 2006.</P1>
<P1>z) Mr. Tonken was also the President and CEO of Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Nexia</BOLD>&rdquo;). And Mr. Matthews was a member of Nexia's Board of Directors.</P1>
<P1>aa) On September 12, 2007, Nexia entered into an agreement with Cavalon's shareholders to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Cavalon. The purchase price was $333,390 and was satisfied by the issuance of 1,666,950 common shares of Nexia at a price of $0.20 per share. Cavalon's only significant asset was the Cavalon Agreement.</P1>
<P1>bb) The 1,666,950 Nexia shares (received as consideration for the Cavalon shares) were placed in Escrow, pending the closing of a transaction between Xillix and a third party.</P1>
<P1>cc) On September 18, 2007, Nexia and Cavalon amalgamated to form Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>New Nexia</BOLD>&rdquo;), which became Cavalon's successor in interest to the Cavalon Agreement.</P1>
<P1>dd) On September 24, 2007, the Restructuring Plan was completed. Pursuant to the Restructuring Plan, the following occurred:
<P2>i) New Nexia made a non-interest bearing loan of $4,400,000 to Xillix (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Convertible Loan</BOLD>&rdquo;);</P2>
<P2>ii) $3.6 million (of the $4.4 million) was used by Xillix to settle its creditors' claims;</P2>
<P2>iii) Xillix's authorized share capital was increased by creating an unlimited number of non-voting and an unlimited number of preferred shares;</P2>
<P2>iv) Approximately 94.5% (or $4,160,000) of the Convertible Loan was converted into 112,023,510 common shares and 435,647,055 non-voting shares of Xillix. As a result of this transaction, New Nexia held 45% of the voting common shares and 100% of the non-voting shares (or 80% of the total equity interest) in Xillix. The remaining $240,000 loan amount was non-interest bearing, without security and repayable on demand; and</P2>
<P2>v) Xillix changed its name to Biomerge Industries Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Biomerge</BOLD>&rdquo;);</P2></P1>
<P1>ee) On September 26, 2007, the shares of Biomerge were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and listed on the NEX, under the symbol &ldquo;BIL.H&rdquo;. The non-voting shares of Biomerge were not listed.</P1>
<P1>ff) At December 31, 2007, Biomerge had 248,941,152 voting common shares and 435,647,055 non-voting shares issued and outstanding. The common shares and non-voting shares ranked equally as to dividend rights and rights on liquidation. The non-voting shares were convertible to common shares on a one-to-one basis.</P1>
<P1>gg) As a result of the Restructuring Plan, Biomerge had no operating business, had no assets other than cash and other nominal assets and was indebted to New Nexia in the amount of $240,000.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI>Tax Attributes of Biomerge</TI>
<P><P1>hh) At the end of December 31, 2008, Biomerge had the following tax attributes (collectively the &ldquo;<BOLD>Biomerge Tax Attributes</BOLD>&rdquo;):

<BLOCK4><TI>GAAR</TI>
<P><P1>sss) The transactions outlined above including the Letter of Agreement, the Cavalon Agreement, the Restructuring Plan, the Plan of Arrangement and Arrangement were a series of transactions.</P1>
<P1>ttt) The following were avoidance transactions that resulted directly or indirectly, and were part of a series of transactions which series resulted directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit to the appellant within the meaning of subsections 245(2) and (3) of the Act (collectively the &ldquo;<BOLD>Avoidance Transactions</BOLD>&rdquo;):
<P2>i) The transactions between Cavalon and Xillix, including:

<P2>ii) The September 12, 2007 Share Purchase Agreement, whereby Nexia agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Cavalon in exchange for 1,666,950 common shares of Nexia (at a price of $0.20 per share), held in Escrow pending the closing of a transaction between Xillix and a third party.</P2>
<P2>iii) The September 18, 2007 Nexia and Cavalon amalgamation whereby the amalgamated entity New Nexia became the successor in interest to the Cavalon Agreement.</P2>
<P2>iv) The completion of the Restructuring Plan on September 24, 2007.</P2>
<P2>v) The entering into of the February 2, 2009 Letter of Intent in respect to the proposed business combination transaction involving the Total Trust, Biomerge and New Nexia.</P2>
<P2>vi) The entering into of the March 19, 2009 Arrangement Agreement whereby the Total Trust announced its conversion from an income trust to a corporation pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement.</P2>
<P2>vii) The February 1, 2009 interest rate change on the Trust Debenture from 10% to 2% and again on May 20, 2009, from 2% to 15%, giving rise to interest expense of $23,224,652 for TESL and a corresponding income inclusion of $3,486,000 and $19,738,652 for the Total Trust and New Total (Biomerge), respectively.</P2>
<P2>viii) The May 20, 2009 closing of the transactions listed in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the Arrangement Agreement made March 19, 2009, and amended and restated April 15, 2009.</P2>

<P2>xi) The January 1, 2010 amalgamation of New Total and TESL to form the appellant, whereby the tax pools of each predecessor became those of the appellant.</P2></P1>
<P1>uuu) The tax benefits were the preservation, carry-forward and use of the Biomerge Tax Attributes which subsequently formed a portion of the TESI Tax Attributes resulting in the reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax by the appellant.</P1>
<P1>vvv) None of the Avoidance Transactions on their own or as part of a series of transactions could reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit, within the meaning of section 245 of the Act.</P1>
<P1>www) the tax consequences to the appellant that are reasonable in the circumstances to deny the tax benefit is to deny use of the TESI Tax Attributes (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Tax Consequences</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1></P>
<P>12. In determining the appellant's tax liability for the 2010 and 2011 taxation years, the Minister considered:
<P1>a) that the general policy of the Act is to prohibit the transfer of losses between arm's length parties, subject to certain express and permissive exceptions, and that subsection 111(5) (and also the related provisions in respect of the Tax Attributes under subsections 111(4), 37(6.1) and 127(9.1) of the Act) is an anti-avoidance provision designed to prevent arm's length loss trading from an unrelated business;</P1>
<P1>b) that the purpose of the SIFT legislation proposing a distribution tax was to restore the balance and fairness to the federal tax system by effecting income tax neutrality on business profits earned by corporations and income trusts; and</P1>
<P1>c) the Minister assumed that the Conversion Rules for SIFTs, including under subsections 85.1(8), 107(3) and (3.1) of the Act, were designed to ensure that income trusts could reorganize as corporations without facing an additional tax burden at the time of conversion, but were not meant to facilitate loss trading between unrelated parties.</P1></P>
<P>13. Cavalon was engaged in the business of the monetization of tax losses through reorganizing public and private companies.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P>14. The issues are:
<P1>a) whether the reassessments for the appellant's 2010 and 2011 taxation years were issued outside the &ldquo;normal reassessment period&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>b) whether section 245 of the Act applies so as to deny use of any of the TESI Tax Attributes claimed by the appellant.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELIED ON</TI>
<P>15. He relies on sections 37, 85.1, 88.1, 107, 111, 122, 122.1, 127, 152, 245, 248 (including 248(10)) and 256, and subsection 69(11) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>16. The appellant has pleaded no facts or grounds respecting the issue raised in paragraph 51(d) of the notice of appeal regarding whether the reassessments were issued outside the normal reassessment period. In any event, the normal reassessment period of the appellant in respect of the 2010 and 2011 taxation years ended four-years after the date of initial assessment, in accordance with paragraph 152(3.1)(a) of the Act, as the appellant was at all material times a corporation other than a Canadian-controlled private corporation.</P>
<P>17. The Avoidance Transactions were avoidance transactions that resulted directly or indirectly, or were part of a series of transactions which resulted directly or indirectly, in tax benefits to the appellant within the meaning of subsections 245(2) and (3) of the Act.</P>
<P>18. The tax benefits were the preservation, carry-forward and use of the Biomerge Tax Attributes which subsequently formed a portion of the TESI Tax Attributes resulting in the reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax by the appellant.</P>
<P>19. None of the Avoidance Transactions on their own or as part of a series of transactions could reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for <EM>bona fide</EM> purposes other than to obtain the tax benefits, within the meaning of subsections 245(1) and 245(3) of the Act.</P>
<P>20. It may reasonably be considered that the Avoidance Transactions were structured in a manner:
<P1>a) to circumvent subsections 111(4) and 111(5) (plus subsections 37(6.1) and 127(9.1)) and the general policy of the Act regarding tax attribute trading, in a manner that frustrates and defeats their object, spirit and purpose,</P1>
<P1>b) to achieve an outcome subsections 111(4) and 111(5) (plus subsections 37(6.1) and 127(9.1)) and the general policy of the Act regarding tax attribute trading were intended to prevent,</P1>
<P1>c) that defeats the underlying rationale of subsections 111(4) and 111(5) (plus subsections 37(6.1) and 127(9.1)) and the general policy of the Act regarding tax attribute trading,</P1>
<P1>d) to abuse the provisions of Act that form part of the general policy of the Act read as a whole regarding the trading of tax attributes between unrelated entities, and</P1>
<P1>e) that defeats the underlying policy of the SIFT Conversion Rules, including subsections 85.1(8) and 107(3) and (3.1).</P1></P>
<P>21. In accordance with subsections 245(2) and 245(5) of the Act, imposing the Tax Consequences to the appellant is reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny the tax benefit that would, but for section 245, result directly or indirectly from the Avoidance Transactions.</P>
<P>22. He requests that the appeals be dismissed, with costs.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>AMENDED</UNDER> NOTICE OF MOTION</TI>
<P><BOLD>TAKE NOTICE THAT</BOLD> the Respondent will make a motion to the Court <UNDER>on Monday, October 16, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., or as soon after that time as the motion may be heard at the Tax Court of Canada, 701 West Georgia Street, 6th Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia</UNDER> <STRIKE>by teleconference on a date and time to be determined-by-the-Court</STRIKE>.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR</BOLD> an order:</P>
<P>1. directing the appellant to respond to the Crown's follow-up questions dated March 31, 2017;</P>
<P>2. extending the time for communicating with the hearings coordinator as provided in the Court's order dated March 8, 2017; and</P>
<P>3. providing such further and other relief as this Court deems just.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE</BOLD> that:</P>
<P>1. This motion is brought by the Crown as directed by the Court's letter of May 25, 2017. The relevant background and circumstances are as follows.</P>
<P>2. The parties conducted oral examinations for discovery on October 17 and 18, 2016 in Calgary, Alberta.</P>
<P>3. By Order dated November 3, 2016, and by agreement, the parties were directed to satisfy undertakings given at the examinations for discovery by January 16, 2017 and to communicate with the hearings coordinator on or before February 16, 2017.</P>
<P>4. The appellant applied, by application dated January 12, 2017, for an amendment to the order dated November 3, 2016. As a result of the application, and by order dated January 16, 2017, the time for answering undertakings given at the examination for discovery was extended to January 31, 2017 and the parties were directed to communicate with the hearings coordinator by March 3, 2017.</P>
<P>5. The parties provided responses to undertakings and matters taken under advisement by letters dated January 31, 2017.</P>
<P>6. The appellant required the Crown's nominee to re-attend for an oral follow-up examination in Calgary respecting the Crown's responses to the appellant's undertaking requests and matters taken under advisement. The oral examination was subsequently held in Calgary on March 3, 2017.</P>
<P>7. By letter dated March 3, 2017, and with the agreement of the Crown, counsel for the appellant advised the Court that the parties anticipated the Crown would be (i) providing follow-up questions (to the appellant's nominee) by the end of March 2017 and (ii) answering undertakings given at the follow-up examination (held on March 3, 2017) by the end of March. Counsel for the appellant also asked that the parties further communicate with the hearings coordinator on or before April 15, 2017 to advise the Court of the status of the proceedings.</P>
<P>8. By order dated March 8, 2017, the order dated January 16, 2017 was amended to provide that (i) further written examinations for discovery questions and examinations for discovery shall be served on the opposing party by March 31, 2017; (ii) the answers to the further written examinations for discovery questions shall be served on the opposing party by March 31, 2017; and (iii) the parties shall communicate with the hearings coordinator in writing on or before April 15, 2017.</P>
<P>9. By letter dated March 30, 2017, counsel for the Crown delivered the Crown's responses arising from the appellant's oral follow-up examination for discovery of the Crown's nominee held on March 3, 2017.</P>
<P>10. By letter dated March 31, 2017, counsel for the Crown served follow-up questions in writing.</P>
<P>11. April 15, 2017 was a Saturday. The date for communicating with the hearings coordinator was diarized to April 17, 2017 (i.e., the Easter Monday holiday) in the Department of Justice calendar system for recording deadlines to counsels' calendars. On or about April 21, 2017, counsel for the Crown realized that neither party had communicated with the hearings coordinator. Counsel for the Crown thereafter wrote to the Court by letter dated April 21, 2017 and advised, in part, that the Crown was awaiting the appellant's responses to follow-up questions.</P>
<P>12. To date, the appellant has not responded to the Crown's follow-up questions.</P>
<P>13. In the circumstances, the appellant should be directed to provide answers to the Crown's follow-up questions and it would be just and reasonable to extend the date for the parties to communicate with the hearings coordinator.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</BOLD> will be used at the hearing of the motion:</P>
<P>1. the affidavit of Ruby Manget <UNDER>sworn and filed electronically on May 30, 2017</UNDER> <STRIKE>(to be filed)</STRIKE>; and</P>
<P>2. such further and other material as counsel may advise.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE ESTIMATED DURATION</BOLD> of this hearing will be 1/2 hour.</P>
<P><BOLD><UNDER>Originally</UNDER> DATED</BOLD> at the City of Vancouver, the Province of British Columbia, this 30th day of May, 2017 <UNDER>and amended on July 17, 2017</UNDER>.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF MOTION</TI>
<P><BOLD>TAKE NOTICE THAT</BOLD> the Applicant, Total Energy Services Inc. (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Appellant</BOLD>&rdquo;), will make a motion to the Court on Monday, October 16, 2017 at 2: 00 p.m., or as soon after that time as the motion may be heard, at the Tax Court of Canada, 701 West Georgia Street, 6<SUP>th</SUP> Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia.</P>
<P><BOLD>THE MOTION IS FOR</BOLD> an Order pursuant to Rules 95, 105(2), 107(3) and 110 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure)</EM> requiring the Respondent to:
<P1>(i) answer the questions identified in Schedule A and produce unredacted copies of any documents related thereto:</P1>
<P1>(ii) re-attend and answer all proper follow-up questions; and</P1>
<P1>(iii) pay costs of this motion as ordered by the Court.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE:</BOLD></P>
<P>2. The question in the appeal to the Tax Court of Canada (&ldquo;<BOLD>TCC</BOLD>&rdquo;) is whether the general anti-avoidance rule (&ldquo;<BOLD>GAAR</BOLD>&rdquo;) applies so as to deny the Appellant the right to use its previously existing tax attributes against income from a business that it acquired from an income trust (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Trust</BOLD>&rdquo;) as part of a &ldquo;<BOLD>SIFT Conversion</BOLD>&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Transactions</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The Respondent's Reply asserts that the Appellant is denied the use of its previously existing tax attributes under the GAAR on the basis, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that the Transactions were structured to circumvent subsections 111(4), 111(5), 37(6.1) and 127(9.1) of the Act (the Streaming Provisions) and the general policy of the Act regarding tax attribute trading, resulting in an abuse of those provisions, achieving an outcome they were intended to prevent and are an abuse of the Act as a whole<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply at para. 12 and 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and farther that they defeat the underlying policy of the SIFT Conversion Rules, including subsections 85.1(8) and 107(3) and 107(3.1) of the Act.</P>
<P>4. The Supreme Court has established that to apply the GAAR, in addition to identifying the provisions that are alleged to have been frustrated or defeated, the Minister must (a) identify the object, spirit or purpose of those provisions, when the provisions of the Act are interpreted in a textual, contextual and purposive manner<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Queen v. Canada Trustco Mortgage Company</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 54</CITE><PARANUM>65</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 63</CITE><PARANUM>69</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (a &ldquo;<BOLD>Policy</BOLD>&rdquo;); and (b) establish that the abusive nature of the transaction is clear.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Queen v. Canada Trustco Mortgage Company</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 54</CITE><PARANUM>50</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 63</CITE><PARANUM>68</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. In <EM>Birchcliff</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Birchcliff Energy Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>[2013] 3 CTC 2169</CITE><COURTJUR>TCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Crown refused to plead or particularize the fact of the Policy relied upon by the Minister on the basis that Policy is a question of law. Justice Miller flatly rejected the Crown's argument and held that &ldquo;Policy must be disclosed to the Appellant in Reply&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In the course of his Reasons, Justice Miller stated [emphasis added]:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>GAAR is a unique piece of legislation in that it allows the Government to bypass provisions of the Act based on an abuse of Policy, a Policy that it is up to the Crown to prove, and then impose whatever consequences it deems reasonable. ... <EM>The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear the Crown must prove a Policy in GAAR cases: it is the integral starting point of a GAAR challenge. It is unlike any other provision of the Act</EM>. There is no slippery slope.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>6. In this appeal, the Policy on which the Minister relied is pleaded in general terms: that the Streaming Provisions are &ldquo;designed to prevent arm's length loss trading from an unrelated business&rdquo; and &ldquo;the general policy of the Act is to prohibit the transfer of losses between arm's length parties, subject to certain express and permissive exceptions&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply at para 12(a); similarly broad assertions of the Policy allegedly relied upon are made in para 12(b) and (c).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Moreover, the Minister states the Policy on which it relied related to the SIFT Conversion is that the SIFT conversion rules in the Act, including subsections 85.1(8), 107(3) and 107(3.1) (the &ldquo;<BOLD>SIFT Conversion Rules</BOLD>&rdquo;) were &ldquo;not meant to facilitate loss trading between unrelated parties&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reply at para. 12 (b) and (c).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. However, despite the clear message from this Court in <EM>Birchcliff</EM> about the centrality of Policy in a GAAR appeal, the Crown resists appropriate disclosure in discovery. The Crown denies the Appellant discovery about the details of the Policy at issue, or discovery probing the veracity of the Minister's asserted reliance thereon. The Crown raises the same objections, as asserted, and rejected, in <EM>Birchcliff</EM> and in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Superior Plus Corp. v R</SOC><CITE>2015 TCC 132</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd by</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2015 FCA 241</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that the Minister's views on Policy are irrelevant and speak to a question of law. Alternatively, the Minister has asserted that the questions are overly broad or relate to another taxpayer.</P>
<P>9. The law is settled that there is a broader standard for relevance at discovery than at trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>569437 Ontario Inc. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>94 DTC 1922</CITE><COURTJUR>TCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The standard for relevance on discovery is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a question or document might elicit information which may directly or indirectly advance a party's case or damage the case of the other party or which fairly might lead to a train of inquiry that advances a party's case or damages the case of the other party.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Queen v. Lehigh Cement</SOC><CITE>2011 FCA 120</CITE><PARANUM>27 to 34</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>HSBC Bank of Canada v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2010 TCC 462</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> citing <CASEREF><SOC>Teelucksingh v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2010 TCC 94</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Documents in the Minister's file relating to the assessment are <EM>prima facie</EM> relevant unless the Crown clearly proves otherwise.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>HSBC Bank of Canada v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2010 TCC 462</CITE><PARANUM>14 and 15</PARANUM></CASEREF>, citing <CASEREF><SOC>Kossow v. The Queen; Amp of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>87 DTC 5157</CITE><COURTJUR>FCTD</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; and <CASEREF><SOC>4145356 Canada Limited v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2011 TCC 220</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. The Crown's central objections relate to documents of which the Appellant is aware exist through the decision in the <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM> appeal that relate to the Minister's Policy on SIFT Conversions and the GAAR. These documents have led to a train of inquiry which may assist the Appellant's case, or damage the Respondent's case. <EM>Prima facie</EM>, it appears the disputed documents suggest that the Minister, despite serious misgiving as to the Policy actually reflected in the Act to allow the Policy to remain as it was, which is inconsistent with the Minister's position in its pleadings, bowed to pressure from the Department of Finance.</P>
<P>11. The train of inquiry is meant to determine whether the Policies alleged in the Reply clearly underlie the Streaming Provisions, SIFT Conversion Rules or the Act as a whole. For example, it is necessary to determine whether the introduction of paragraph 256(7)(c.l) on an electively retroactive basis constituted a change of Policy under the Act. It is also necessary to determine whether the Minister actually determined that the Transactions abused a general Policy of the Act.</P>
<P>12. In <EM>Lehigh</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>The Queen v. Lehigh Cement</SOC><CITE>2011 FCA 120</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Crown argued, in the context of a discovery request for general internal CRA policy memoranda, that &ldquo;opinions expressed by CRA officials outside of the context of particular taxpayer's situation are irrelevant&rdquo;. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected this assertion, ordered production of internal CRA policy memoranda and endorsed the long established jurisprudence that, at discovery, questions and document requests are proper where &ldquo;the information in the document may advance his own case or damage his or her adversary's case&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para 23 and paras. 27 to 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Further, in <EM>Superior</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Superior Plus Corp. v R</SOC><CITE>2015 TCC 132</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>aff'd by</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2015 FCA 241</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, the TCC dealt with access to records and information during an appeal concerning the application of GAAR to the use of previously existing tax attributes against income from businesses acquired by Superior Plus Corp. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Superior</BOLD>&rdquo;) from an income trust as part of a SIFT conversion.</P>
<P>14. The Crown objected to Superior's request mostly on the basis of relevance<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, arguing that Superior was not entitled to investigate the mental process of the Minister or its officials in raising the assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the TCC held that a taxpayer should be entitled to proceed along a train of inquiry related to the Policy that the Minister claims it considered and/or relied on in the making of a GAAR assessment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. Accordingly, the TCC in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM> ordered that questions respecting the following issues be answered: (i) information with respect to the Department of Finance's consideration as to whether to make a subsequent amendment to the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> retroactive; (ii) the Attorney General's understanding of the policy underlying the introduction of the SIFT conversion rules; and (iii) information contributing to the Attorney General's position to be taken at trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Additionally, the Court ordered that the following documents be produced: (i) GAAR Committee items, meetings and referral; (ii) a memorandum to file of a CRA Auditor; (iii) emails between CRA officials and auditors; and (iv) memoranda to the GAAR Committee from the Aggressive Tax Planning division.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 36.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Notwithstanding the clear direction of the Federal Court of Appeal in <EM>Lehigh</EM> and subsequently in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM>, in this appeal, the Crown takes a still narrower view and refuses discovery even on documents which, on their face, were prepared directly in the context of the taxpayer's particular situation, namely as part of a &ldquo;SIFT conversion&rdquo;. To the contrary, as most recently held by this Court in <EM>Dominion Nickel Investments</EM>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dominion Nickel Investments Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2015 TCC 14</CITE><PARANUM>48&ndash;50</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> the Appellant is entitled to production of, and discovery on, such documents unless the Crown can establish that the documents are &ldquo;clearly irrelevant&rdquo;.</P>
<P>17. The information and records at issue in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM> were no different from the information requested by the Appellant in this case. In both cases, the taxpayer requested information surrounding the GAAR policy at issue, including the Crown's understanding of that policy and its application in the context of SIFT conversions. In fact, several documents are the identical documents requested, and ordered to be produced by the Tax Court, in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See questions/documents requested in questions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. Based on the foregoing, the Crown's objections with respect to the questions and records identified in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; must be rejected.</P>

<P><QUOTE><P>...In enacting the GAAR, Parliament has provided the Minister with an additional basis for reassessment of a taxpayer within the detailed structur e for reassessing set forth in the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>. Even though section 245 permits the Minister to base that reassessment on the policy of the Act rather than the explicit provisions of the Act other than section 245, <UNDER>that policy is created by Parliament and interpreted by the courts. The Minister has not been delegated any power to make policy...</UNDER><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kaulius v.

Canada</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 55</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> [underlining added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. Overview</TI>
<P>1. The appellant has examined the nominee for the Crown twice and has requested and been provided numerous documents, including the audit file. There is no evidence that there are any further relevant documents regarding the reassessments at issue in this appeal.</P>
<P>2. By this motion the appellant seeks documents and information (the &ldquo;Requested Documents and Information&rdquo;) dealing with unrelated taxpayers or which were produced during the course of the audit of unrelated taxpayers. There is no evidence any of the Requested Documents and Information were produced or considered in the course of issuing the reassessments at issue in this appeal.</P>
<P>3. This Court (three times) and the Federal Court of Appeal have recently clarified the principles regarding disclosure of such documents and information and those principles make clear that the Requested Documents and Information are not producible. In fact, this Court and the FCA have already dealt with 14 of the 18 requests for documents being made in the appellant's motion. The motion should be dismissed with respect to those 14 requests, as well as the remaining four.</P>
<P>4. The Requested Documents and Information can be broken down as follows:
<P1>a. Documents and information regarding the application of the GAAR to other taxpayers (Motion Request #1; Discovery Request #4);</P1>
<P1>b. Communications between the CRA and Finance regarding changes or proposed changes to the SIFT conversion rules (Motion Request #2; Discovery Request #7);</P1>
<P1>c. Specific documents ordered to be produced by the Crown in <CASEREF><SOC>Superior Plus Corp. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2015 TCC 132</CITE></CASEREF> (<EM>Superior #1</EM>), <CASEREF><CITE>2015 FCA 241</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><CITE>2016 TCC 217</CITE></CASEREF> (<EM>Superior #2</EM>) (Motion Requests #3 and 6 to 18; Discovery Requests #8 and 17 to 29);</P1>
<P1>d. A memo referred to in an email dated December 5, 2014 dealing with settlement (Motion Request #4; Discovery Request #12); and</P1>
<P1>e. A copy of the approval of the GAAR Committee regarding another taxpayer (Motion Request #5; Discovery Request #16).</P1></P>
<P>5. As stated, there is no evidence any of the Requested Documents and Information were produced or considered in the course of issuing the reassessments at issue in this appeal. The recent jurisprudence makes clear they are not producible.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. This Court established a demarcation line in <EM>Superior Plus Corp.</EM></TI>
<P>6. The appellant's pursuit of the Requested Documents and Information is forestalled by this Court's test for relevance as set out in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, as endorsed by the FCA, and then applied by Justice Hogan in the follow-up motion in <EM>Superior #2</EM>, and by Justice V. Miller in <EM>MP Western Properties Inc.</EM> et al (<EM>MP Western</EM>).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>MP Western Properties Inc. et al v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2017 TCC 82</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. In particular, in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, this Court found that the demarcation line for establishing the relevance of documents at discovery was whether the documents were either prepared directly in the context of the audit of the taxpayer or were considered by CRA officials who were charged with the audit of the taxpayer or who were consulted regarding the application of the GAAR:
<QUOTE><P>[19] ...the motion record shows that the Refused Documents were either prepared directly in the context of the audit of the Appellant or were considered by CRA officials who were charged with the audit of the Appellant or who were consulted regarding the application of the GAAR.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. This demarcation line served as the benchmark that was used to assess the relevance of the Refused Documents in <EM>Superior #1</EM>. This Court's analysis in <EM>Superior #1</EM> respecting Refused Document 1 is illustrative, referring to the minutes of the GAAR Committee meeting:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>Decision</UNDER>: The redacted portion of Item 1 ... is clearly relevant as it relates to the Appellant...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #1</EM> at p. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. And so, for example, in <EM>Superior #1</EM> this Court did not order production of an unredacted version of Refused Document 16 (an intradepartmental communication) because &ldquo;the redacted information was not relevant to the Appellant and contained information relating to other taxpayers which is protected by section 241&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #1</EM> at p. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. Likewise, in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, this Court did not order production of unredacted versions of Refused Documents 17 and 18 (both interdepartmental communications between CRA and Finance) for the same reason noted for Refused Document 16.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #1</EM> at p. 21 to 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. The FCA endorsed this Court's demarcation line of relevance in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, stating
<QUOTE><P>[8] ... However, relevance in the present case is no less established by the Tax Court judge's finding that the refused documents were either prepared in the context of the audit of Superior Plus or considered by officials who were involved in that audit (Reasons at para. 19).</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. In <EM>Superior #2</EM>, this Court further clarified the basis for ordering production. After noting that the taxpayer had disputed (in the Answer) whether the Minister actually relied on the existence of the policy (pleaded by the Crown in conformity to this Court's decision in <EM>Birchcliff Energy Ltd.</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Birchcliff Energy Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2012 CarswellNat 5540</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2013] 3 CTC 2169</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>TCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (<EM>Birchcliff</EM>).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>) and sought production of certain documents dealing with what was prepared in the context of the audit of the taxpayer or considered by the Minister's officials who were charged with that audit or consulted, Justice Hogan described the basis for ordering production:
<QUOTE><P>[2] I granted, in part, the Appellant's motion on the basis that, at the very least, the information sought could aid the Appellant in establishing that the Minister had not relied solely on the alleged policy or had not concluded that the impugned transactions clearly frustrated this policy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #2</EM>, citing para. 32 of the Reasons in <EM>Superior #1</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>13. It might, at first blush, be concluded that there were other bases for ordering production of certain documents in <EM>Superior #1</EM>. For example, this Court ordered production of Refused Document 4, an email between CRA and Finance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #1</EM> at p. 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> But in <EM>Superior #2</EM> Justice Hogan described Refused Document 4 with more particularity, noting that it concerned the taxpayer:
<QUOTE><P>[40] These questions arise out of, and are logically connected to, the production of the email ... as redacted by the 2015 Order. They are relevant insofar as they go to the same issue as Document 4 did, that being the facts and circumstances surrounding the pleading of the policy. In the email, Mr. Adams cites the (at the time proposed) conversion of <UNDER>the Fund into what is now the Appellant</UNDER>, using an existing corporation, as an example of the loss-shifting transactions involving income funds that were causing the erosion of &ldquo;billions of dollars&rdquo; from the tax base.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #2</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (underlining added)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. In <EM>MP Western</EM>, Justice Miller applied the demarcation line established in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, where she stated:
<QUOTE><P>[28] Most recently, in <EM>Superior Plus No. 1</EM>, Hogan J. dealt with a very similar refusals motion in the context of a GAAR assessment where the policy behind the various Streaming Rules was at issue. In that case, Hogan J ordered the disclosure of all refused documents that either were prepared in the context of the taxpayer's audit or were considered by the CRA officials who had charge of the audit or who were consulted during the audit: <EM>Superior Plus No. 1</EM> at paragraph 19.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>15. Justice Miller acknowledged that, in a GAAR case, documents not specific to the taxpayer but relating to the policy of the <EM>Act</EM>, may be ordered to be disclosed in certain circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at para. 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, such documents must still satisfy the demarcation line that they were either prepared in the context of the audit of the taxpayer or considered by officials who were involved in the audit of the taxpayer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at paras. 30-31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Miller ordered the production of one such document based on her finding of fact that the &ldquo;document was in Western's file and it was considered by CRA during the audit of Western&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at para. 35 re document 20 and document 60 (document 20 and 60 were the same document).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The appellant's submissions either ignore or skirt around the demarcation line established by this Court in <EM>Superior</EM>, as affirmed by the FCA, and as applied in <EM>MP Western</EM>.</P>
<P>17. Moreover, the FCA's decision in <EM>Lehigh</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Lehigh Cement Limited</SOC><CITE>2011 FCA 120</CITE></CASEREF> (<EM>Lehigh</EM>).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> does not in conflict with the established and principled demarcation line in the context of an appeal involving the GAAR. This was made clear in the appeal in <EM>Superior #1</EM> where the FCA acknowledged that relevance could be admitted by conduct:
<QUOTE><P>[8] As was held by this Court in <EM>Lehigh Cement Ltd</EM>... in like circumstances, information pertaining to the policy of the Act, even where it is not taxpayer specific, can be relevant on discovery. We accept that an important consideration in that case was that the Crown had itself established the relevance of the documents by disclosing an internal policy memorandum on the subject (<EM>Lehigh</EM> at para. 41)...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. Admitted relevance has no application here since no admission similar to that in <EM>Lehigh</EM> has been made by the Crown.</P>
<P>19. It is also important to put this Court's decision in <EM>Birchcliff</EM> in its proper context. <EM>Birchcliff</EM> is a &ldquo;pleadings case&rdquo; that sets out what a taxpayer is entitled to for purposes of pleading in a GAAR case. Several relevant points emerge or were summarized in <EM>Birchcliff</EM>:
<P1>a. The Crown must prove a policy in a GAAR case (para. 15). The Minister does not assume how the policy was abused as a fact (paras. 20 and 21). The policy is not a fact and certainly not an assumption. The policy is a question of law which the Court must ultimately determine (para. 18).</P1>
<P1>b. It is imperative that the Crown's reply set out as a material fact that the Minister relied on x or y policy underlying the provisions at play (para. 18). The policy must be disclosed in the reply, but not a treatise. It can be policy gleaned from a &ldquo;collective view&rdquo; (para. 19).</P1>
<P1>c. Abuse is not a question of fact but a determination to be made by the Court, having concluded what the policy is and whether the facts are such that they in some fashion abuse that policy (para. 20).</P1>
<P1>d. Although the policy may be argued differently at trial, the taxpayer is entitled to know&mdash;in the form of particulars and as a matter of pleading in the reply&mdash;the Minister's starting point. What the assessor relied upon in making the assessment does not bind the Crown (paras. 23 and 24).</P1></P>
<P>20. Moreover, in <EM>Birchcliff</EM>, the taxpayer wanted the Crown to identify precisely how the policy was abused. The Court said the request was made on the presumption the Minister assumed how the policy was abused as a fact and said this made no sense:
<QUOTE><P>21. What the Appellant wants is for the Respondent to identify precisely how the Policy was abused. The request is made on the presumption the Minister assumed how the Policy was abused as a fact. This makes no sense to me. The Minister did not assume how the Policy was abused as a fact. The Minister concluded, based on the Policy and the facts assumed, that there was an abuse, presumably in one or a combination of the three forms above. I cannot see how further particulars of facts can emanate from this interpretation.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>21. Here, the Crown pleaded in paragraph 12 of the Reply&mdash;post <EM>Birchcliff</EM>&mdash;in a summary way what the Minister considered to be the policy of the particular provisions under consideration for the GAAR analysis. Nowhere in the examination for discovery of the Crown's nominee did the appellant challenge or suggest that the Minister, as represented by the auditor, in reassessing the appellant, did not rely on or believe in the policy stated in paragraph 12.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of the examination of the auditor held on October 18, 2016 (the &ldquo;Discovery Transcript&rdquo;), Tab A of the Affidavit of Rosalind Semchuk. Counsel for the appellant specifically examined on paragraph 12 of the Reply, commencing at p. 49.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. Application of the Demarcation Line to the Requested Documents and Information</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The evidentiary record regarding the Requested Documents and Information</EM></TI>
<P>22. There is no evidence that any of the Requested Documents and Information were either prepared in the context of the audit of the appellant or considered by officials who were involved in that audit.</P>
<P>23. The appellant asked for (Discovery Request #2) and was provided with the entire &ldquo;audit file&rdquo; regarding the appellant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript at p. 19, lines 12 to 19 re Discovery Request #2 (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit); Crown's Answers to Undertakings (Tab B of Semchuk Affidavit) at p.1 re Discovery Request #2; Crown's Revised Answers to Undertakings (Tab C of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p.1 re Discovery Request #2; and Transcript of the follow-up examination of the auditor held on March 3, 2017 (the &ldquo;Follow-up Transcript&rdquo;) (Tab D of Semchuk Affidavit) at p.71, lines 25 to 27 re Discovery Request #2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. None of the Requested Documents and Information was in the audit file, even in redacted form.</P>
<P>25. Further, aside from the documents being requested in Motion Requests #1, 4, and 5, none of the other Requested Documents and Information is even <EM>referred to</EM> in any of the documents in the appellant's audit file.</P>
<P>26. The evidence from the examination for discovery regarding the Requested Documents and Information is as follows.</P>
<P>27. In Motion Request #1 (Discovery Request #4), the appellant seeks &ldquo;documents or information with respect to the GAAR committee's approval of the application of the GAAR&rdquo; to other taxpayers on the basis of the following excerpt from the proposal letter written by the auditor:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 32, lines 3 to 11 and lines 20 to 24.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>The GAAR Committee has approved the application of the general anti-avoidance rule, the GAAR, to similar arrangements. Accordingly, we have applied Section 245(2) and (5) of the act to the CCAA planned transactions.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>28. The appellant incorrectly assumed that the auditor was in possession of or had considered documents and information regarding other SIFT conversion transactions during the course of his audit of the appellant.</P>
<P>29. The evidence of the auditor regarding those &ldquo;similar arrangements&rdquo; and the extent to which he had regard to them in his audit of the appellant was to the contrary, however, as described below:
<P1>a. the &ldquo;similar arrangements&rdquo; that are referred to in the August 26, 2015 letter are loss restart transactions and not SIFT conversion transactions;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 83, lines 2 to 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>

<P>30. In Motion Request #2 (Discovery Request #7), the appellant sought correspondence and documents between the CRA and Finance regarding changes or proposed changes to the Act on the issue of the application of the acquisition of control rules to SIFT conversions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 46, line 27 to p. 47, line 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Aside from it being clear on its face that the request seeks evidence with respect to questions of law, the evidence at the discovery makes clear that none of the requested documents have any connection to the appellant:
<P1>a. The audit file did not contain any documents or correspondence between the auditor and anyone at Finance;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 74, line 22 to p. 75, line 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>b.

<P>31. In Motion Request #3 (Discovery Request #8), the appellant seeks production of certain documents that were ordered to be disclosed by Justice Hogan in <EM>Superior #1</EM>. The appellant marked pages 16 to 25 of the reasons of Justice Hogan in <EM>Superior #1</EM> as Exhibit A-4 at the examination and then requested that the highlighted documents be produced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 52, line 19 to p. 53, line 20 and see p. 28, lines 2 to 9; Exhibit A-4 at the examination of the auditor (Tab A1 of the Semchuk Affidavit).

<P>32. With respect to Motion Request #4 (Discovery Request #12), in the audit file disclosed in response to Discovery Request #2, the Crown provided an email dated December 5, 2014, from Helen Little to the auditor (which was marked as Exhibit A-7 at the examination).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 75, lines 3 to 10 and p. 76, line 13 to 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appellant seeks production of a memo that is referred to in that email. The email itself is not in the motion record. The only evidence with respect to that memo is that it is from headquarters CRA and contains comments regarding a settlement agreement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p.75, lines 20 to 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>33. With respect to Motion Request #5 (Discovery Request #16), in response to Discovery Request #5, the Crown had produced a number of documents evidencing discussions between the auditor and the GAAR and technical support section of CRA Headquarters, including a memorandum dated January 6, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Revised Answers to Undertakings (Tab C of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 2 re Discovery Request #5; Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 83, lines 18 to 22. The memorandum was incorrectly dated January 6, 2015 and should have been dated January 6, 2016 (Respondent's Answers to Undertakings at the Follow-Up Examination (Tab E of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p.1 re Discovery Request #13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. At the follow-up examination, the appellant asked to be advised of the correct date of the memo and to be provided with the recommendations of the GAAR Committee and the &ldquo;approval&rdquo; of the GAAR Committee referred to in the memo.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 85, lines 10 to 25 (Discovery Requests #14 and 15) and p. 86, lines 21 to 26 (Discovery Request #16).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In response, the Crown provided the correct date of the memo but refused to provide the recommendations or approval as they related to another taxpayer and there was no evidence the recommendation or approval was considered here by the auditor.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Answers to Undertakings at the Follow-Up Examination (Tab E of the Affidavit of Rosalind Semchuk) at p. 2 regarding undertakings #14, 15 and 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. In this motion, the appellant merely seeks a copy of the &ldquo;approval&rdquo; of the GAAR Committee that is referred to in the memo (Motion Request #5, Discovery Request #16).</P>
<P>36. The evidence with respect to that January 6, 2015 memorandum and the &ldquo;approval&rdquo; is as follows:
<P1>a. The memo was received by the auditor in the course of his audit of the appellant and he relied on that memo in raising the assessments against the appellant;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 83, lines 24 to 27 and p. 84, lines 9 to 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>b. Although the memo refers to &ldquo;recommendations of the GAAR Committee&rdquo;, the auditor did not know what those were and had never seen them;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 84, lines 14 to 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>c. The memo states that the &ldquo;GAAR Committee already approved the application of the GAAR to the SIFT conversion scheme&rdquo; but the auditor never had a copy of that approval.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 86, lines 4 to 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>37. With respect to Motion Requests #6 to 18, at the follow-up examination of the auditor, the appellant proceeded to go through Exhibit A-4 (the extract from the <EM>Superior #1</EM> decision) and asked the auditor regarding his knowledge of each of the highlighted documents and asked for an specific undertaking with respect to each that it be produced (those are Discovery Requests #17 to 29).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Follow-up Transcript (Tab D of the Semchuk Affidavit): beginning at page 87 and continuing to page 98.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Crown refused to provide the documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In the Respondent's Answers to Undertakings given at the Examination (Tab B of the Semchuk Affidavit at p.3 re Discovery Request #8), the Crown refused to provide the documents highlighted in Exhibit A-4. At the follow-up examination, in response to a request by the appellant for production of each specific document, the Crown refused to provide the document.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> With respect to each document, the auditor was asked the same series of three questions and gave the same evidence:
<P1>a. the auditor had not reviewed the document after the adjournment of the first round of the discovery;</P1>
<P1>b. the auditor was not aware whether the document dealt with a specific taxpayer; and</P1>
<P1>c. the auditor was not aware whether the document was created in the course of a specific audit of a particular taxpayer.</P1></P>
<P>38. Although not asked directly, it is nonetheless clear from the entire record that none of the documents being requested in Motion Requests #6 to 18 (Discovery Requests #17 to 29) dealt with the appellant, nor were they created in the course of the audit of the appellant, nor were they reviewed by the auditor in the course of his audit of the appellant.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The Requested Documents and Information are not disclosable according to the demarcation line</EM></TI>
<P>39. The appellant's request for the Requested Documents and Information is an impermissible fishing expedition as it is not limited to documents and information that was either prepared in the context of the audit of the appellant or considered by officials who were involved in that audit. The appellant has already been provided with a copy of the audit file related to the appellant. Any further documents being sought by the Requested Documents and Information would be irrelevant on the basis of the demarcation line established in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal and then applied in <EM>Superior #2</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM>.</P>
<P>40. The appellant's reliance on this Court's decision in <EM>Dominion Nickel Investments Ltd.</EM> is misplaced.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dominion Nickel Investments Ltd. v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2015 TCC 14</CITE></CASEREF></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice Jorre utilized the same demarcation line established in <EM>Superior #1</EM>, upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal and then applied in <EM>Superior #2</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM>. The disputed documents were found to be relevant and their production was ordered based on two findings, neither of which is present in our case:
<QUOTE><P>[46] I first note that there are two reasons which suggest that the documents in Exhibit R-2 are, <EM>prima facie</EM>, relevant to the appeal. First, they were produced in the respondent's list of documents under rule 81. The fact that they were produced in that list suggests that at some point the respondent thought that they were relevant to the appeal.</P>
<P>[47] Secondly, most documents, including the ones which are entirely redacted, have a cover sheet which has on it as a case name &ldquo;Dominion Nickel Investments Ltd.&rdquo;. Again this suggests that at some point these documents were thought relevant to this matter or, at least, they involved inquiries which were thought to be potentially relevant to this matter.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>41. Aside from the documents being requested in Motion Requests #1, 2, 4 and 4, the appellant's sole basis for the Requested Documents and Information is that the documents were ordered to be disclosed in <EM>Superior</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 28, lines 2 to 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and both this case and <EM>Superior</EM> deal with the application of the GAAR to a SIFT conversion. But that is clearly insufficient and ignores that certain principles for disclosability (i.e., a demarcation line) were established and applied in <EM>Superior</EM>. The appellant seeks to avoid application of that demarcation line for good reason&mdash;unlike in <EM>Superior</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM>&mdash;the requisite evidence is not present to satisfy it.</P>
<P>42. There is no evidence any of the Requested Documents and Information were either prepared in the context of the audit of the appellant or considered by officials who were involved in the audit of the appellant and no admission of relevance by the conduct of the respondent, unlike in <EM>Dominion Nickel</EM>. None of the Requested Documents and Information are producible and the motion should be dismissed.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. Other Grounds for Refusals</TI>
<P>43. Even prior to the decisions in <EM>Superior</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM>, this Court, when espousing the general principles applicable to discoveries, had recognized that the so-called &ldquo;audit file&rdquo; is producible at discovery.</P>
<P>44. As none of the Requested Documents and Information was part of the &ldquo;audit file&rdquo;, the demarcation line established in <EM>Superior</EM> is sufficient to deal with this motion.</P>
<P>45. However, there are other well-established discovery principles that also come into play and support the position that none of the Requested Documents and Information are producible:
<P1>a. A party is entitled to know the position of the other party as to an issue of law, but is not entitled to have access to either the legal research or the reasoning by which that position is arrived at.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Lloyd M. Teelucksingh v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2010 TCC 94</CITE><PARANUM>15(ix)</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Kathryn Kossow v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2008 TCC 422</CITE><PARANUM>60</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This would apply to support the position that Motion Requests #2, 3 and 6 to 18 are improper.</P1>
<P1>b. Documents that contain information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege are not producible unless there has been waiver of that privilege. This arises in respect of the following documents:
<P2>i. Motion Request #3 (Superior Refused Documents 23, 22, 21 and 6 referred to below);</P2>
<P2>ii. Motion Request #6 (Superior Refused Document 23 at p. 0034);</P2>
<P2>iii. Motion Request #7 (Superior Refused Document 22 at p. 0017);</P2>
<P2>iv. Motion Request #8 (Superior Refused Document 21);</P2>
<P2>v. Motion Request #16 (Superior Refused Document 6 at p. 1); and</P2>
<P2>vi. Motion Request #4.</P2></P1>
<P1>c. Documents concerning settlement are covered by settlement privilege and the privilege applies whether or not a settlement is reached.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Sable Offshore Energy v. Ameron International</SOC><CITE>2013 SCC 37</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>. See also Justice Hogan's finding in <EM>Superior #1</EM> in respect of Refused Document 12 at p. 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This applies to the memo requested in Motion Request #4 and the document requested in Motion Request #6 (Superior Refused Document 23).</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. The Finance Request (Motion Request #2; Discovery Request #7)</TI>
<P>46. The appellant seeks production of any correspondence and documents between the CRA and Finance regarding changes or proposed changes to the Act on the issue of the acquisition of control rules to SIFT conversions (Motion Request #2; Discovery Request #7).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Discovery Transcript (Tab A of the Semchuk Affidavit) at p. 47, lines 10 to 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>47. The Finance Request is not specific to the appellant, or any taxpayer for that matter. There is no evidence any of the documents covered by the Finance Request were considered in issuing the reassessments at issue or were part of the audit file of the appellant.</P>
<P>48. On its face, the Finance Request is vague, overbroad and abusive as it does not name any areas of the CRA or individual authors or recipients of the correspondence requested and thus would seemingly require the respondent to make inquiry of all current and former employees of both the CRA and Finance.</P>
<P>49. This Court's decisions in <EM>Superior #1</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM> illustrate how the request is irrelevant.</P>
<P>50. In <EM>Superior #1</EM>, this Court refused to order the production of Refused Documents 16 and 17 for the following reasons:
<P1>a. Refused Document 16 was an intradepartmental communication dated July 28, 2010 unrelated to the taxpayer regarding &ldquo;Tax Loss Trading&rdquo;. The Court held that the redacted information was not relevant to the taxpayer and also contained irrelevant taxpayer information protected by s. 241.</P1>
<P1>b. Refused Document 17 was an interdepartmental communication between the CRA and Finance dated February 18, 2008 regarding subsection 111(5). The Court held that the information should not be produced for the same reasons as those noted for Refused Document 16.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #1</EM> at p. 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>51. In <EM>MP Western</EM>, this Court likewise held that the same interdepartmental communication between CRA and Finance dated February 18, 2008 (i.e., Refused Document 17 in <EM>Superior #1</EM> and Document 18 in <EM>MP Western</EM>) did not have to be produced as it was not specific to the appellants in <EM>MP Western</EM> and the redacted portions concerned irrelevant information of other taxpayers which is protected under s. 241.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at p. 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. In Motion Requests #3 and 11 and 12, the appellant requests these same documents (i.e., Superior Refused Documents 16 and 17) that this Court held should not be produced. And the appellant is plainly wrong when it states in its written submissions that the documents requested in Motion Requests #11 (Superior Refused Document 17) and 12 (Superior Refused Document 16) &ldquo;were ordered to be produced&rdquo; in <EM>Superior #1</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See para. 50 of the appellant's written submissions.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. Moreover, in <EM>MP Western</EM>, the appellant's made an omnibus request, seeking the full record of the correspondence during the period 2001 to 2012 between the Department of Finance and the CRA, including emails, memos and letters, with respect to the CRA's perceived deficiency in the legislative scheme dealing with tax losses. Justice Miller refused the request, stating:
<QUOTE><P>Decision&mdash;...There was no evidence that any of these documents were prepared in the context of the Appellant's audit. There was evidence that only Document 20 was considered during the audit of Western. The Appellant's request is a &ldquo;fishing expedition of vague and far-reading scope&rdquo;. It is overly broad and it would be an onerous task to satisfy. Any documents obtained would contain the opinions of the writers who were not involved in the audit of the Appellants. This search does not have to be undertaken. The request is refused.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at p. 16 re Request #6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. Justice Miller likewise denied another similar request in MP Western in which the appellants sought correspondence between the CRA and Finance with respect to the legislative scheme dealing with so-called corporate loss trading, tech wrecks or transfers of corporate losses.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>MP Western</EM> at p. 23 re Request #23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. In addition, and aside from the statute-barred issue, the Notice of Appeal sets out the only other issue being whether section 245 applies to the transactions at issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal, paragraph 51.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> No allegation or ground is raised in the Notice of Appeal regarding:
<P1>a. the policy of the Act,</P1>
<P1>b. whether the policy used in reassessing the appellant was correct (as opposed to just not applying on the facts), or</P1>
<P1>c. whether the policy changed as a result of the subsequent amendments.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Such matters were put in issue in <EM>Superior</EM> and <EM>MP Western</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>56. The only reason specified in the Notice of Motion as to why the appellant wants the Requested Documents and Information&mdash;the train of inquiry the appellant is following&mdash;is set out in paragraph 11 of the appellant's Motion:
<QUOTE><P>The train of inquiry is meant to determine whether the Policies alleged in the Reply clearly underlie the Streaming Provisions, SIFT Conversion Rules or the Act as a whole.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>57. As previously stated, in the Reply, consistent with this Court's finding in <EM>Birchcliff</EM>, the Crown set out the Minister's conclusions on the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the Act relied on by the Minister in issuing the reassessments at issue. These were not assumptions of fact in the sense of assumptions made by the Minister and presumed to be true unless <EM>prima facie</EM> demolished.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Birchcliffat</EM> para. 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>58. The object, spirit or purpose (or policy) of specific provisions is a question of law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2005 SCC 54</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Canada Trustco</EM>&rdquo;) at para. 44. See also <EM>Superior #2</EM> at para. 79.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>59. In <EM>Superior #2</EM>, this Court made clear that the internal views and deliberations of Finance and what Finance believed to be a policy that underpins the Act are irrelevant to determining whether such a policy actually does exist.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Superior #2</EM> at paras. 77 and 78.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. Although the Crown is required to set out the policy with reference to the provisions of the Act upon which the Crown relies, ultimately, the Court must:
<P1>a. determine the object, spirit and purpose or policy of the provisions of the Act relied on for the tax benefit (having regard to the scheme of the Act, the relevant provisions and permissible extrinsic aids);<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 63</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Copthorne&rdquo;)</EM> at para. 69 and <EM>Canada Trustco</EM> at para. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and</P1>
<P1>b. consider whether the transactions fall within or frustrate the identified object, spirit or purpose of the provisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Copthorne</EM> at para. 71 and <EM>Canada Trustco</EM> at para. 55.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>61. The reference to &ldquo;extrinsic aids&rdquo; is a reference to the comment of Rothstein J., as he then was, in <CASEREF><SOC>OSFC Holdings Ltd v. Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, that in determining the object and spirit of a particular provision for purposes of subsection 245(4) analysis it will be necessary to refer to extrinsic aids such as technical notes, writings, Hansard and enacting notes:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>OSFC Holdings Ltd. v. Canada</SOC><CITE>2001 FCA 260</CITE><PARANUM>63</PARANUM></CASEREF>; see also <CASEREF><SOC>Klaboe v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2007 TCC 239</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. The common element amongst these aids is that they deal with the final version of the provision considered and enacted by Parliament, rather than a draft, and they are public statements and documents.</P>
<P>63. In <EM>Imperial Oil Ltd.</EM>, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that permissible extrinsic aids were materials such as judicial statements, <EM>Hansard</EM>, ministerial or departmental statements, explanatory notes, bulletins, circulars, texts and periodicals:
<QUOTE><P>[49] One must infer from the statutory language the policy, if any, on which the relevant provisions of the Act are unambiguously based. This exercise in statutory interpretation must be undertaken with the assistance of such extrinsic aids as: judicial statements, <EM>Hansard</EM>, ministerial or departmental statements, explanatory notes, bulletins, circulars, texts, periodicals and others...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada v. Imperial Oil Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2004 FCA 36</CITE><PARANUM>49</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>64. Not every comment, opinion, memorandum, departmental report or email is admissible as an aid to statutory interpretation. Intra-departmental memoranda and opinions of individual departmental officials do not reflect the intention of Parliament in enacting legislation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See Isaac CJ (in dissent) in <CASEREF><SOC>Owen Holdings Ltd. v. R</SOC><CITE>1997 CarswellNat 1012</CITE><COURTJUR>FCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at para. 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. Likewise, it has been held that relying on out-of-legislature views and opinions of ministers and members of the legislature would be an unwarranted extension of the concepts underlying the court's resort to admissible extrinsic aids, as was stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Ontario Teachers' Federation v. Ontario (Attorney General)</SOC></CASEREF>.
<QUOTE><P>In my opinion, it would be an unwarranted extension of the concepts underlying the court's resort to aids such as Hansard, royal commission reports, government policy papers and other such sources bearing upon the history and background of the legislation, to broaden those concepts to apply to the sworn testimony and out-of-legislature views and opinions of ministers and members of the legislature. It would also be inconsistent with the weight of existing authority on the subject: ...<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>1998 CanLII 14680</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1998] O.J. No. 545</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>Ont. Gen. Div.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at p. 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. Questions regarding the amendment are also questions of law. At trial, the Court will have to consider whether the amendment indicates anything about the object, spirit and purpose of the pre-amendment provisions. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gwartz v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gwartz v. The Queen</SOC><CITE>2013 TCC 86</CITE></CASEREF> (<EM>Gwartz</EM>).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> this Court stated that a subsequent amendment must be considered along with all other relevant materials to ascertain the object, spirit, and purpose of the provision, noting that in certain circumstances a subsequent amendment might suggest that the provision's object, spirit and purpose was frustrated by the tax avoidance strategy. In other circumstances, however, this Court said it might be suggested that Parliament simply changed its mind and now intends to prevent something that initially was not intended to be captured by the provision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Gwartz</EM> at para. 57.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>67. What is important, however, is that in considering the subsequent amendment, the usual rules will apply; the trial judge will have to consider the provisions of the Act and admissible extrinsic aids. The amendment does not make internal views or opinions of CRA and Finance officials relevant for the object, spirit and purpose analysis.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. Taxpayer information</TI>
<P>68. Subsection 241 of the Act prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer information to a third party, subject to specific and limited exceptions. The scope of section 241 and the principles established in previous cases was considered in <CASEREF><SOC>9005-6342 Quebec Inc. v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2010 TCC 463</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In that case, Justice Hogan determined that information protected by section 241 must meet the threshold requirement of relevance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>9005-6342 Quebec Inc.</EM> at para. 38.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <EM>Superior #1</EM>, Justice Hogan similarly upheld redactions on the basis of section 241.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>See for example, <EM>Superior #1</EM>, p. 17, re Refused Document 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
