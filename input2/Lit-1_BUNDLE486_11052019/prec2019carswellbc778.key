<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF APPEAL</TI>
<P>Take notice that the Canada Revenue Agency hereby appeals to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Punnett of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, pronounced the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> day of March, 2018, at Victoria, British Columbia.</P>
<P>1. The appeal is from a:
<P1>[X] Trial Judgment</P1>
<P1>[ ] Summary Trial Judgment</P1>
<P1>[ ] Order of a Statutory Body</P1>
<P1>[ ] Chambers Judgment</P1></P>
<P>2. If the appeal is from an appeal under Rule 18-3 or 23-6(8) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules or Rule 18-3 or 22-7(8) of the Supreme Court Family Rules, name the maker of the original decision, direction or order:</P>
<P>3. Please identify which of the following is involved in the appeal:
<P1>[ ] Constitutional/Administrative</P1>
<P1>[ ] Civil Procedure</P1>
<P1>[ ] Commercial</P1>
<P1>Family&mdash;</P1>
<P1>[ ] Divorce</P1>
<P1>[ ] <EM>Family Law Act</EM></P1>
<P1>[ ] Corollary Relief in a Divorce Proceeding</P1>
<P1>[ ] Other Family</P1>
<P1>[ ] Motor Vehicle Accidents</P1>
<P1>[ ] Municipal Law</P1>
<P1>[ ] Real Property</P1>
<P1>[X] Torts</P1>
<P1>[ ] Equity</P1>
<P1>[ ] Wills and Estates</P1></P>
<P>(The Divorce Registry will, as applicable, be notified by the Court of Appeal Registry on filing if the appeal involves divorce, corollary relief in divorce proceeding or matters under the <EM>Family Relations Act</EM>)</P>
<P>And further take notice that the Court of Appeal will be moved at the hearing of this appeal for an order that:
<P1>1. the order of March 2, 2018 be set aside;</P1>
<P1>2. the Appellant be awarded its costs in this Court and the Court below; and</P1>
<P1>3. such other relief as this Court considers appropriate.</P1></P>
<P>The grounds for the appeal are:
<P1>1. The trial judge erred in law in reversing the onus of proof by requiring the appellant to prove the material facts in the malicious prosecution case; the issue is not whether the material facts were proved during the malicious prosecution case, but whether they could amount to proof of reasonable and probable cause for the Crown to commence a criminal prosecution;</P1>
<P1>2. The trial judge erred in law in finding that the Crown was required to prove the actual mechanics of fraud in order to establish the <EM>actus reus</EM> of tax evasion at the criminal trial;</P1>
<P1>3. The trial judge erred in fact and law in finding that the material facts known to the Crown could not establish reasonable and probable cause for prosecution;</P1>
<P1>4. The trial judge erred in law and fact in finding that the CRA initiated the prosecution;</P1>
<P1>5. The trial judge made a palpable and overriding error of fact in finding that the CRA investigator suppressed or withheld material evidence from the Crown, and that he was motivated by malice;</P1>
<P1>6. The trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in awarding the legal costs of the defence of the plaintiffs' corporations in the criminal trial, when the corporations were not plaintiffs in the civil trial; and</P1>
<P1>7. Such other grounds as the Appellant may submit at the hearing of this matter.</P1></P>
<P>The trial of this proceeding occupied twelve (12) days.</P>
<P>Dated at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 3<SUP>rd</SUP> day of April, 2018.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>&ldquo;Reasonable and probable cause&rdquo; under the third element of the test for malicious prosecution in <EM>Miazga</EM> requires a prosecutor to objectively assess the legal strength of the case. Probable guilt means that the prosecutor believes, based on an existing state of circumstances, proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be made out in a court of law. Where private action is taken against a Crown attorney for malicious prosecution, the trial judge must decide whether, on the basis of the circumstances known to the prosecutor at the relevant time, reasonable and probable cause existed to commence or continue a prosecution from an objective standpoint. The Crown defendant is not required to prove that the criminal allegations are in fact made out.</P>
<P>These fundamental propositions have been ignored in this case. The trial judge reversed the onus of proof by requiring the defendants to prove that the criminal allegations of tax evasion were true. Moreover, the trial judge erroneously held that the elements of tax evasion required the defendants to prove the actual mechanics of the fraudulent scheme. This in turn led him to conclude that the CRA investigator had intentionally suppressed or withheld material information from the Crown because he was motivated by malice, contrary to the evidence before the court.</P>
<P>The trial was fundamentally flawed as a consequence of the trial judge's misapprehension of the law which then corrupted his analysis of the evidence. The Respondents neither proved an absence of reasonable and probable cause nor did they prove that the CRA investigator held any improper purpose in the course of his investigation. As a result, there was no basis in law or on the facts of this case for a finding of malicious prosecution.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>The CRA Investigation and Referral For Charge Approval</TI>
<P>1. On March 3, 2006, the Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) contacted the Respondents to begin an audit of their restaurant business, MGM Restaurant Ltd. (&ldquo;MGM&rdquo;). An anonymous informant had reported to the CRA that MGM had unreported cash sales and paid suppliers in cash.
<P1>Appeal Book (&ldquo;AB&rdquo;) p. 332, para. 5; p. 333, para. 8: <EM>Witness Report of Glen Foster</EM></P1></P>
<P>2. The Respondents had destroyed their records, including till tapes and other source documents. However, the auditor Glen Foster, was able to conduct an audit based on a review of records in the Respondents' accountant's office. He found that large amounts of cash which could not be explained by the reported sales of the businesses had been deposited into the Respondents' accounts prior to the audit. There were also increases in reported cash sales after the audit without corresponding expenses. Based on these and other findings, the auditor referred the case to the CRA's Special Investigations section to consider a criminal investigation.
<P1>AB p. 532: <EM>Audit Referral to Special Investigations</EM></P1></P>
<P>3. A Primary Report was prepared recommending investigation. A full criminal investigation was launched. Searches under warrant took place in January of 2007. During the search the Respondents' bookkeeper Deborah Ferens, told CRA investigator Terry Finlay, that she only worked from daily sales summary sheets provided to her by Mr. Samaroo; she did not look at till tapes.
<P1>AB p. 3&ndash;15: <EM>Primary Report</EM>; p. 16&ndash;26: <EM>Terry Findlay Notes of Ferens Interview</EM></P1></P>
<P>4. Following the searches the investigation file was transferred to Investigator Keith Kendal. Mr. Kendal prepared a draft prosecution report in December of 2007. The report was reviewed by Janna Hyman, Senior Counsel in the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (&ldquo;PPSC&rdquo;) Economic Crimes Group, who then assigned the file to Counsel Lisa McLean in January of 2008 for a preliminary consideration of whether a prosecution should proceed.
<P1>Transcript Volume (&ldquo;Ts. V.&rdquo;) 2, p. 327, line 29&ndash;41, <EM>Kendal</EM>; AB p. 27&ndash;54: <EM>Draft Prosecution Report</EM>; Ts. V. 2, p. 559, l. 29 to p. 560, l. 33<EM>, Hyman</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>5. Ms. McLean prepared a working memo concluding that a prosecution was justified on the evidence against Tony Samaroo personally and as a party to the corporate offences of MGM. However, the available evidence against Helen Samaroo and another corporation, Samaroo Holdings Limited (&ldquo;SHL&rdquo;) at that time did not meet the Federal Prosecution Deskbook standard for laying charges. Ms. McLean determined that further steps in the investigation needed to occur before charges could be laid.
<P1>Ts. V. 1, p. 146, l. 31&mdash;p. 148, l. 28: <EM>McLean</EM>; AB p. 58&ndash;67: <EM>Draft Charge Approval Memo</EM></P1></P>
<P>6. Brian Jones was appointed as agent of the Director of Public Prosecutions regarding charges against the Respondents for offences under sections 239(1)(a) and (d) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> and under the <EM>Excise Tax Act</EM>, for the taxation years 2004 to 2006 by way of a retainer letter dated January 22, 2008.
<P1>AB p. 68-69: <EM>Letter of Appointment</EM></P1></P>
<P>7. Ms. Hyman became the supervising PPSC counsel for the prosecution. She communicated regularly with Mr. Jones. She reviewed the materials from the CRA including a finalized prosecution report with attachments dated March 18, 2008 (the &ldquo;Prosecution Report&rdquo;). In her opinion the evidence justified prosecution of both Respondents as well as MGM and SHL.
<P1>Ts. V. 2, p. 564, l. 7- to p. 565, l. 7; p. 572, l. 11&ndash;33: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 611, l. 23&mdash;p. 612, l. 12; p. 613, l. 22&mdash;p. 614, l. 3; p. 619, l. 40&ndash;620, l. 26: <EM>Hyman</EM>; AB p. 239&ndash;562: <EM>Prosecution Report</EM></P1></P>
<P>8. As agent prosecutor, Mr. Jones was expected to liaise with the CRA, to review the documents and evidence, and to consult with the supervising PPSC counsel within the Economic Crimes Group. Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones discussed the evidence and consulted on the form of specific charges and initial sentencing position. Ms. Hyman instructed Mr. Jones on how to proceed based on the facts discussed. As agent prosecutor, Mr. Jones was bound by the decisions of Ms. Hyman with respect to whom to charge, with what, sentencing position and whether a prosecution should continue. He was responsible for drafting the specific charges in consultation with the PPSC. Mr. Jones could not decide to charge or not charge other than as Ms. Hyman directed.
<P1>Ts. V. 1, p. 142, l. 14&mdash;p. 144, l. 34: <EM>McLean</EM>; Ts. V. 2, p. 571, l. 12 to p. 572, l. 10; p. 580, l. 42&mdash;p. 582, l. 10: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts.

<P>9. Mr. Jones consulted with the CRA for the figures to include in the charges to ensure he had the right quantum.
<P1>Ts. V. 3, p. 630, l. 33&ndash;42: <EM>Jones</EM></P1></P>
<P>10. The evidence available to the CRA and prosecutors before the charges were sworn included the following from the Prosecution Report:
<P1>a. the Respondents were joint shareholders and principals of their three businesses, MGM, Samaroo Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;SHL&rdquo;) and Samaroo Motel Ltd . Their personal incomes were derived from the revenues of those businesses;</P1>
<P1>b. the MGM restaurant was open 24 hours per day and had one cash register. There were three shifts per day, each rung off with a separate till tape. There had been three shifts a day, rung off at the end of each shift, for the years 2003 to 2007 and earlier: AB p. 247; 252; 280;</P1>
<P1>c. the Respondents were both active in the businesses. They managed the MGM restaurant together. Mr. Samaroo's involvement included working in the kitchen, paying staff and suppliers, and preparing and providing the business' paperwork to the bookkeeper. Ms. Samaroo's role included working as a shift supervisor, managing the till during her shifts, training staff, paying suppliers and preparing end of shift paperwork. Ms. Samaroo also managed the nightclub, operated by SHL. She worked there three to four days per week: AB p. 247; 334; 360;</P1>
<P1>d. All paperwork and cash from the businesses were brought into an office space controlled by the Respondents within the MGM. Cash from the various businesses was commingled. Deposits were made to various joint personal and corporate bank accounts on an almost daily basis without connection to the underlying cash component of sales for that period: AB p. 247; 265;</P1>
<P1>e. Mr. Samaroo provided daily sales summary sheets with till tapes and other documentation for all the businesses to the bookkeeper, Deborah Ferens. Ms. Ferens posted the daily totals from the sales summary sheets to a monthly worksheet, which was the basis for the income tax and GST filings for the Respondents and their businesses: AB p. 260-261; 335; 360;</P1>
<P1>f. Ms. Ferens did not use the supporting till tapes themselves to prepare the monthly worksheet. She only posted sales data from the daily sales summary sheets provided to her by Mr. Samaroo. She would not be able to state which till tape or shift information she received: AB p. 251 at 6<SUP>th</SUP> bullet; 335;</P1>
<P1>g. Cash totaling $1,754,740 was deposited into the Respondents' accounts or used to pay suppliers in the relevant years without any known source, including:
<P2>i. Cash totaling $661,164 was deposited into the personal bank accounts but there were no recorded cash payments by the corporations to the Respondents: AB p. 264&ndash;266;</P2>
<P2>ii. Cash totaling $498,788 in excess of recorded sales receipts was deposited into the corporate bank accounts and cash payments of $594,788 were made for liquor, wages and suppliers for MGM. These amounts were credited to the shareholder loan account, reflecting an obligation owing by the corporation to the shareholder for these transactions. However, there were no cash withdrawals from the Respondents' personal bank accounts which could explain the origin of these cash amounts: AB p. 268&ndash;272;</P2>
<P2>iii. The corporations paid the Respondents for rental or management fees through journal entries crediting those amounts to the shareholder loan account. The corporations reduced this debt by paying amounts on behalf of the Respondents. There were no payments by cheque or transfers from the corporate bank accounts to the personal bank accounts of the Respondents. The expenditures made on behalf of the Respondents exceeded the amounts owing to them by the corporations for rent and GST: AB p. 266-267;</P2></P1>
<P1>h. A comparison of the periods before and after March 2006, when the audit by the CRA began, revealed the following:
<P2>i. The daily summary sheet for MGM received by Ms. Ferens prior to the audit had three columns marked &ldquo;Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;Days Total&rdquo;. After the audit began, the sheet began to show four columns of data including a totals column: AB p. 251, last bullet; 253, last bullet; 360, entry for March 21, 2006, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> paragraph; 372: <EM>Daily Cash Report;</EM></P2>
<P2>ii. The daily sales amounts for MGM provided to the bookkeeper by Mr. Samaroo increased by about $50,000 per month, or an average of approximately $1,500 per day after the audit began. However, food costs, menu items and prices, and the makeup and volume of customers remained about the same: AB p. 253&ndash;260;</P2>
<P2>iii. The amounts deposited to the business accounts from merchant cards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) remained constant. However, the ratio of cash sales to merchant card sales for MGM increased from between 24% and 35% of sales being paid by cash in the three years prior to the audit to 51% of sales being paid by cash after the audit commenced: AB 259;</P2>
<P2>iv. The reported gross revenue on the tax return of MGM for the taxation year ending February 28, 2007, the year after the audit, was approximately $500,000 higher than each of the previous two years. However, the reported cost of sales was approximately the same as in each of the previous two years: AB 284;</P2>
<P2>v. Monthly reported sales receipts for SHL, which ran the nightclub, increased by 33% over the previous years' average after the audit began. The reported revenue on the tax return for SHL for the taxation year ending February 28, 2007, was approximately $85,000 higher than the previous year with slightly lower operating expenses: AB 275-276; 284-285;</P2></P1>
<P1>i. During the audit, Mr. Samaroo responded to the auditor's questions about increased sales and the source of the cash used for deposits and payments by providing the following information:
<P2>i. they only recently began doing three ring-offs of the MGM till: AB 360-361;</P2>
<P2>ii. the cash was from savings over many years held in safety deposit boxes and deposited due to fear that the banks would not accept old bills. He did not know how much cash was in the safety deposit boxes or how much he took out each time to make a deposit: AB 361&ndash;363;</P2>
<P2>iii. the increase in monthly revenue was due to increased sales from a better economy, a competitor closing down and price increases. However, he had no explanation as to how revenue from food sales could increase when the cost of supplies for those food sales had not also increased: AB p. 362; 364;</P2>
<P2>iv. he did not know what percentage of his customers paid in cash versus merchant cards: AB 362; 364;</P2></P1>
<P1>j. Mr. Kendal reviewed historical reported family income and debt obligations for the Respondents. In his opinion it was not possible for the cash to have come from savings prior to the 2004, nor was it logical that the Respondents would have held it rather than apply it to debt. Neither Respondent had any taxable income until 1986. From 1990 to 1997 the reported family income averaged $64,000. From 1988 to the date of the audit the Respondents had multiple mortgages and loans, some with high rates of interest. As of January 2003 the Respondents had over $1,000,000 in commercial mortgages outstanding: AB p. 280&ndash;282;</P1></P>
<P>11. A 21-count Information charging the Respondents, MGM and SHL was prepared in Mr. Jones' office and sworn by Keith Kendal on June 12, 2008.
<P1>Ts. V.3, p. 635, l.41&mdash;p. 636, l. 16: <EM>Jones</EM>; AB p. 126&ndash;131: <EM>Information</EM></P1></P>
<P>12. Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones continued to consult from the time charges were sworn throughout the criminal trial. Ms. Hyman decided what the initial sentencing position would be and communicated that to Mr. Jones.
<P1>Ts. V. 2, p. 586, l. 25&mdash;V. 3, p. 589, l. 34: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 590, l. 45&mdash;p. 593, l. 20: <EM>Hyman</EM> Ts. V.3, p. 630, l. 21-27-29; p. 645, l. 3&ndash;38: <EM>Jones</EM></P1></P>
<P>13. Mr. Jones and Ms. Hyman each reviewed the case and believed it met the charge approval standard of a reasonable prospect of conviction and in the public interest.
<P1>Ts. V. 2, p. 596, l. 29&ndash;32: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 600, l. 11&ndash;16; p. 621, l. 32&ndash;46: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 641, l. 9&ndash;18: <EM>Jones</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>The Criminal Trial</TI>
<P>14. The criminal trial took 19 days over a period of five months. In her Reasons for Judgment (April 6, 2011, Nanaimo Registry File No. 65681), Saunders P.C.J. noted that the Crown called 24 witnesses and filed 51 exhibits; the defence called Mr. Samaroo as the only witness: AB p. 135-136, paras. 4-5. The trial judge found Mr. Samaroo to be credible and accepted his explanation, <EM>inter alia</EM>, that he chose not to use the cash he had saved in safety deposit boxes and obtained mortgages instead because he wanted to build up a good credit rating in Nanaimo and he did not trust banks; AB p. 150-151, para. 66. The trial judge found that there were discrepancies in the evidence of the auditor, Glen Foster and the investigator, Keith Kendal and flaws in the analysis of net worth. The trial judge held that even if she had not found Mr. Samaroo to be credible, she could not rely on Mr. Kendal's calculations of the amount of tax evaded: AB p. 155&ndash;157, paras. 82&ndash;88.</P>
<P>15. Accordingly, the trial judge found that the Crown's case was weak and the amount of tax evaded &ldquo;highly uncertain&rdquo;: AB p. 155, para. 83. The Respondents were acquitted of all charges.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>The Civil Trial</TI>
<P>16. The Respondents filed a Notice of Civil Claim against the CRA, Brian Jones and Brian Jones' law corporation on March 29, 2012. The civil trial proceeded before Mr. Justice Punnett against the CRA for malicious prosecution and <EM>Charter</EM> breach and against Brian Jones and his law corporation for malicious prosecution.</P>
<P>17. The Respondents alleged that the Crown could prove neither the <EM>actus reus</EM> nor the quantum for the offence of tax evasion as it could not prove which till tape or shift was not given to Ms. Ferens. The Respondents claimed that Mr. Kendal interfered with the prosecution decision by suppressing the information that Ms. Ferens did not look at the till tapes. The Respondents further alleged that Mr. Kendal falsified evidence of Ms. Ferens by amending her will-say to state that she only received one daily sales summary sheet for each day without confirming the amendment with her. The Respondents claimed Mr. Kendal did this because he knew that the case could not succeed without evidence of which till tape or shift had been reported and he did not want the prosecutors to realize there was no case.</P>
<P>18. Punnett J. accepted that the investigator had suppressed information that the bookkeeper could not identify which till tape or shift was unreported and that this information was crucial in proving the offence of tax evasion. He concluded that as the offence could not be proven, there was no reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. He further held that the CRA initiated the prosecution. He found the CRA was motivated by an improper purpose as it pursued a prosecution knowing it lacked the required evidence and without regard for the presumption of innocence. <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER> (&ldquo;<EM>Reasons</EM>&rdquo;), paras. 196&ndash;198.</P>
<P>19. The CRA was found liable for malicious prosecution and for a section 7 <EM>Charter</EM> breach. The case against Brian Jones and his law corporation was dismissed due to lack of proof of malice.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ERRORS IN JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>20. There are four issues on this appeal:
<P1>1. Whether the trial judge erred in law in holding that the manner of fraud and the quantum of unreported income were necessary elements of proof of the offence of tax evasion;</P1>
<P1>2. Whether the trial judge erred in law by requiring the Appellant to prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of tax evasion in order to establish reasonable and probable cause;</P1>
<P1>3. Whether the trial judge erred in law in finding that the circumstances known to the Crown prosecutor at the relevant time could not establish reasonable and probable cause to commence a prosecution; and</P1>
<P1>4. Whether the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the CRA investigator suppressed or withheld material evidence from the Crown and that he was therefore motivated by malice.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N>I.</N><TI>STANDARD OF REVIEW</TI>
<P>21. The Court of Appeal may review an order of the B.C. Supreme Court where there are errors of law and fact. Questions of law are reviewed on a correctness standard while questions of fact are reviewable on the basis of palpable and overriding error. For questions of mixed fact and law, correctness is the standard if the error may be characterized as one of law, but otherwise the standard of palpable and overriding error applies.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>8, 10, 36</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>22. In <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized four situations where a trial judge's shortcomings in assessing the evidence constitute an error of law. Three such situations are: (1) making a finding of fact for which there is no evidence; (2) assessing the evidence based on a wrong legal principle; and failing to consider all the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue.
<P1><EM>J.M.H.</EM>, <UNDER>2011 SCC 45 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 24&ndash;27, 29&ndash;31</P1></P>
<P>23. On an appeal this Court may make or give any order that could have been given by the court below. This Court may also draw inferences of fact.
<P1><EM>Court of Appeal Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77 as amended, s. 9</P1></P>
<P>24. In this case there are three errors of law which fundamentally undermine the trial judge's analysis. First, the trial judge misapprehended the legal test for tax evasion and what must be proved for the elements to be established in a criminal trial. This led him to err by misapplying the test for reasonable and probable cause in the tort of malicious prosecution. His error regarding the law of tax evasion tainted his analysis of the tort. Thirdly, the trial judge reversed the onus of proof by requiring the Appellant to prove that the criminal allegations were in fact true.</P>
<P>25. Finally, the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the CRA investigator, Mr. Kendal, had suppressed or withheld material evidence from the Crown and that this was evidence of malice.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>II.</N><TI>THE OFFENCES ALLEGED</TI>
<P>26. In order to assess whether a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution claim has established that no reasonable and probable cause existed, the court must consider the elements of the offence and whether those elements could be satisfied on the circumstances known to the prosecutor at the time the charges were laid. The trial judge erroneously found that proof of the <EM>actus reus</EM> required proof of the &ldquo;actual mechanics of the alleged evasion&rdquo;, which in turn depended on the Crown proving which till tapes were missing from the information given to the bookkeeper by Mr. Samaroo. Because the Crown could not prove the &ldquo;missing till-tape theory&rdquo;, the trial judge reasoned that this was a case which the CRA investigator knew from the start could never succeed and hence the investigator could never have held a reasonable belief in probable guilt: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 208.</P>
<P>27. The Respondents were charged under sections 239(1)(a) and (d) of the <EM>ITA</EM> and sections 327(1)(a) and (c) of the <EM>Excise Tax Act</EM> (<EM>ETA</EM>) for the personal and corporate taxation years of 2004, 2005 and 2006 both as individuals and as parties to the offences of their companies. The <EM>ETA</EM> and party offences are not discussed in this factum, as proof of their elements overlaps with those of the <EM>ITA</EM> offences.</P>
<P>28. Section 239(1) of the <EM>ITA</EM> states in relevant part:
<QUOTE><P>Every person who has</P>
<P>(a) made, or participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, false or deceptive statements in a return, certificate, statement or answer filed or made as required by or under this Act of a regulation,</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>(d) willfully, in any manner, evaded or attempted to evade compliance with this Act or payment of taxes imposed by this Act...</P></QUOTE>
is guilty of an offence ...</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Filing a False Return: 239(1)(a)</TI>
<P>29. The <EM>ITA</EM> imposes a legal duty on all tax payers to report their income. The elements of this offence will be proven when the Crown demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused:
<P1>a. made a false or deceptive statement in an income tax return in one or more of the years specified in the charge;</P1>
<P1>b. knew that the statement was false or deceptive; and</P1>
<P1>c. knew that the income tax return was filed with the taxing authority.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Millar</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 2039 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Tax Evasion: Section 239(1)(d)</TI>
<P>30. Subsection 239(1)(d) is not limited to specific conduct, but speaks in broad terms. The crime of evading tax contrary to s. 239(1)(d) is made out if the Crown proves that:
<P1>a. the accused had taxable income in one or more of the years in question;</P1>
<P1>b. the accused knew that there was tax payable on the income;</P1>
<P1>c. the accused voluntarily performed an act or engaged in a course of conduct that avoided or attempted to avoid the payment of tax owing under the ITA;</P1>
<P1>d. the accused engaged in the conduct for the purpose of avoiding or attempting to avoid payment of tax imposed by the Act or knowing that avoiding the payment of tax imposed by the Act was a virtually certain consequence of his actions.
<P2><EM>Millar</EM>, <UNDER>2016 BCSC 2039 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 41; <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Klundert</SOC><CITE>2004 CanLII 21268</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[2004] 23 C.R. (6th) 274</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, paras. 40, 47</P2></P1></P>
<P>31. The Crown must lead evidence that the <EM>actus reus</EM> and the <EM>mens rea</EM> coexisted during the offence period: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Balla</SOC><CITE>2009 BCPC 136 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>139</PARANUM></CASEREF>, upheld on appeal on a different point: <UNDER>2010 BCSC 486 (CanLII)</UNDER>. The Crown does not need to prove the precise amount of tax payable but it must prove that there was at least some tax payable in the relevant year: <EM>Millar</EM>, <UNDER>2016 BCSC 2039 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 42.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><EM>The Actus Reus of Tax Evasion</EM></TI>
<P>32. The Crown is not required to prove a particular &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; or &ldquo;artifice&rdquo; to satisfy the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offence.

<BLOCK4><N><EM>3</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Amount of Tax Evaded is Not an Element of the Offence</EM></TI>
<P>37. Proof of the amount of tax evaded is not an essential element of the offence. The amount is relevant only at sentencing where the degree or extent of the offence becomes an issue. It is sufficient to show that there is an obvious unreported amount of taxable income
<P1><EM>ITA</EM> s. 239(1)(f) and (g); <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Cormier</SOC><CITE>1986 CanLII 1178</CITE><COURTJUR>BC CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, paras. 16&ndash;18, which notes leave to SCC refused Nov. 24, 1986; <CASEREF><SOC>R. v.

<P>38. If the Crown cannot prove the entire amount of alleged tax evaded, the judge can amend the information to the amount proven and convict on that basis.

<P>39. In summary, the law is clear that where the Crown can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily did not report amounts that are taxable as income, with the intent of paying less tax, the accused can be found guilty of tax evasion under section 239(1)(d). Voluntarily making or assenting to or acquiescing in the making of a false statement in a tax return will itself satisfy the elements of 239(1)(a).</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>III.</N><TI>THE TORT OF MALICIOUS PROSECUTION</TI>
<P>40. A plaintiff must prove four elements on a balance of probabilities to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution:
<P1>i. the defendant initiated or continued the prosecution against the plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>ii. the prosecution terminated in the plaintiff's favour;</P1>
<P1>iii. the prosecution was undertaken without reasonable and probable cause; and</P1>
<P1>iv. the prosecution was motivated by malice or a primary purpose other than that of carrying the law into effect.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Miazga v. Kvello Estate</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>3</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>It is the third element of the test that is primarily at issue in this case, though the trial judge also erred in considering the fourth element.</P>
<P>41. At trial, Punnett. J. accepted the Respondents' submission that the <EM>actus reus</EM> of tax evasion could not be proven because the Appellant could not show which till tape was missing from the information given to the bookkeeper by Mr. Samaroo. However, the evidence was clear that the bookkeeper worked from the daily sales summary sheets given to her by Mr. Samaroo; she never worked from the till tapes. The number of till tapes given to the bookkeeper and whether any of them were missing was entirely immaterial to proving the <EM>actus reus</EM> in this case. This fundamental error in law&mdash;that is, that the actual mechanics of the fraudulent scheme had to be proved&mdash;led to erroneous findings that there was no reasonable and probable cause, that the CRA investigator suppressed or withheld material information from the Crown and that he did so maliciously.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Errors Regarding the Test for Tax Evasion</TI>
<P>42. The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly identify the legal elements of tax evasion. He applied the wrong legal principles to the facts when he concluded that the <EM>actus reus</EM> of tax evasion could not be proved at the time the charges were laid.</P>
<P>43. The cornerstone of the Respondents' case was that neither the CRA investigator nor Mr. Jones could prove at the criminal trial which till tape or shift was not reported to the bookkeeper, Ms. Ferens, nor could they prove the quantum of unreported tax. The Respondents argued that therefore neither the investigator nor the Crown could have objectively believed that proof beyond a reasonable doubt <EM>could</EM> be proved. In acceding to this argument, the trial judge failed to properly apply the law regarding the elements of tax evasion. He correctly states the Appellant's position that the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offence is the Respondents' intentional false report of income to the accountant knowing the result will be false reporting of their taxable income: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 202. However, at paragraph 208 Punnett J. finds this is flawed as it does not show the &ldquo;actual mechanics&rdquo; of the alleged evasion. He states &ldquo;To say that the plaintiffs did not report income cannot be the <EM>actus reus</EM>&rdquo;. He came to this conclusion without applying the law regarding tax evasion though it is set out previously in his decision at paragraphs 98 to 105.</P>
<P>44. In particular, the case of <EM>Klundert</EM>, <UNDER>2004 CanLII 21268 (ON CA)</UNDER>, referred to at paragraph 99 of the trial judge's Reasons, defines the task of the prosecutor as proving that the accused voluntarily performed an act or engaged in a course of conduct that avoided or attempted to avoid payment of tax owing under the <EM>ITA</EM>. The <EM>actus reus</EM> will be satisfied where the accused is found to have unreported taxable income.
<P1><EM>Klundert</EM>, <UNDER>2004 CanLII 21268 (ON CA)</UNDER>, paras. 40&ndash;42.</P1></P>
<P>45. The trial judge's error regarding the legal test for tax evasion had cascading consequences for his analysis of the case as a whole. It affected his view of the significance of the evidence regarding the statements of Ms. Ferens's evidence. When the correct legal test is applied it is clear that any discrepancies in whether Ms. Ferens could or could not identify which shift or till tape was not recorded on the daily summary sheet were immaterial. The key facts from her testimony were that the daily sales information was provided by Mr. Samaroo and that those amounts were used to prepare the tax returns.</P>
<P>46. The only significance as to which till tape or shift was unreported is the impact on quantum. However, quantum is not an element of the offence of tax evasion. It is only relevant at sentencing: <EM>Cormier</EM>, <UNDER>1986 CanLII 1178 (BC CA)</UNDER>, paras. 13&ndash;19.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Reasonable and Probable Cause</TI>
<P>47. The onus is on the plaintiff to prove that the elements of the offence charged could not, from an objective standpoint, have been proven based on the information known to the prosecutor at the time the criminal proceedings were initiated: <EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 58, 63, 74&ndash;76. The requirement that the plaintiff prove a lack of reasonable and probable cause reflects a presumption that a public prosecution is properly brought and immune from judicial review absent a demonstrated abuse of the criminal process.</P>
<P>48. The existence of reasonable and probable cause is a question of law. A prosecution is properly brought if the evidence available when the decision to initiate or continue the prosecution was made <EM>could</EM> objectively result in a conviction. This standard for civil liability is lower than the standard for charge approval set out in federal Crown policy manuals of a reasonable prospect of conviction. Hence, the result at the criminal trial does not answer whether reasonable and probable cause existed at the relevant time.
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, 55, 63-64, 73&ndash;76; V. 2, p. 558 L. 15&ndash;21: <EM>Hyman</EM></P1></P>
<P>49. Investigators are not required to evaluate evidence as would a prosecutor. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed this with respect to police investigators in <CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 41 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>50</PARANUM></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>... Police are required to weigh evidence to some extent in the course of an investigation: (cite omitted). But they are not required to evaluate the evidence according to legal standards or to make legal judgments. That is the task of prosecutors, defence attorneys and judges ...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>50. Investigators are therefore not required to assess whether the evidence establishes reasonable and probable cause before referring a case to a prosecutor, who will make the decision whether to proceed with charges.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Franklin v. Toronto Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>[2008] O.J. No. 5237</CITE><COURTJUR>ONSC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>2008 CanLII 67896</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, para. 39.</P1></P>
<P>51. Where a Crown prosecutor determines that there is a reasonable prospect of conviction, it is implicit that those who commenced an investigation had grounds to do so. This is because at law, the standard of a reasonable prospect of conviction in Crown policy manuals is a higher threshold than the tort standard of reasonable and probable cause. As a result, where an investigator recommends charges and the prosecutor approves them, the investigator is considered to have had evidence sufficient to found a conviction on the tort standard: <CASEREF><SOC>Pitney v. Toronto (City) Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 1013 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Franklin</EM>, <UNDER>2008 CanLII 67896 (ON SC)</UNDER>, paras. 39-40, 60, 65. This presumption is based on both the prosecutor and investigator having the same information regarding the grounds for the charges.</P>
<P>52. In any event, in this case the CRA investigator did have reasonable and probable cause on an objective standard and did subjectively hold a belief in the Respondents' guilt when he referred the case to the Crown for charge approval.</P>
<P>53. Reasonable and probable cause will not be negated by showing that a defendant had both exculpatory and inculpatory information. Discrepancies in the evidence as to what occurred are for the trier of fact. They do not undermine a finding of reasonable and probable grounds to lay charges.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Chmielewski v. Niagara (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2009 ONCA 51 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>6</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>54. If the court concludes, on the basis of what was known at the time the proceedings were initiated, that reasonable and probable cause objectively existed, the prosecution is properly brought and the claim for malicious prosecution will fail.
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 75.</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Application to this Case: Errors in Assessing Reasonable and Probable Cause</TI>
<P>55. The onus is on the Respondents to show that reasonable and probable cause did not exist when charges were sworn. The only ground on which they alleged it did not exist was that the prosecution could not prove which till tape or shift was not being reported to the bookkeeper. The Respondents did not contest any of the evidence in the Statement of Facts above from which a trier of fact <EM>could</EM> infer that the cash was unreported business income. Since a trier of fact could draw such an inference, the Respondents failed to meet their onus.</P>
<P>56. The appropriate method of analysis is to determine the elements of the offence of tax evasion and whether they objectively were met on the evidence available to the prosecution at the time the charges were sworn. This is the process required by <EM>Miazga</EM> to properly apply the test for reasonable and probable cause. Any assessment of the evidence by other persons is irrelevant to this objective review by the trial judge.</P>
<P>57. The trial judge failed to apply the test for reasonable and probable cause as established in <EM>Miazga</EM>. In his analysis the trial judge makes a number of distinct legal errors:
<P1>a. While he sets out the elements of tax evasion at paragraphs 98 to 100 of his decision, he does not assess the available evidence on an objective basis to see if those elements are met. He failed to ask himself if the Respondents consciously did something that avoided tax, knowing tax was owing, and did that thing for the purpose of avoiding tax or knowing that it was virtually certain that avoidance of tax would result. Instead he frames the analysis around an incorrect understanding of the <EM>actus reus</EM>;</P1>
<P1>b. The trial judge relied on the decision of the criminal trial judge in rejecting the evidence put forward by the Appellants to demonstrate that reasonable and probable cause existed when the charges were sworn: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 206. This is directly contrary to the Supreme Court of Canada's warnings that care must be taken to review the facts based on what was known to the prosecutor when the charges were initiated, not what resulted at trial: <EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 55, 76;</P1>
<P1>c. The trial judge reversed the onus of proof. Rather than requiring the Respondents to prove a lack of reasonable and probable cause, he held that the material facts demonstrating the existence of reasonable and probable cause which were put forward by the Appellants &ldquo;have not been proven at this trial&rdquo;. <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 206. This is contrary to the law as set out in <EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER> at paras. 55 and 58;</P1>
<P1>d. The trial judge stated that &ldquo;there was never an explanation given as to how Ms. Helen Samaroo may have been involved in this alleged scheme of evasion&rdquo;. In doing so, he ignored the evidence of Ms. Hyman and contained in the Prosecution Report as to why the decision was also made to charge Ms. Samaroo: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 243. Finding that there was no evidence on this point when clearly there was some, is an error of law: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>31</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>58. When the evidence set out in the Statement of Facts above is assessed against the legal test for tax evasion set out in <EM>Millar</EM> and <EM>Klundert</EM>, it is clear that reasonable and probable cause did exist. The evidence available to the prosecution showed that the business income reported to the bookkeeper, which was used to prepare the Respondents' income tax returns, did not reflect all the funds flowing into the hands of the Respondents. This conclusion is further strengthened by the evidence that once the audit commenced, the reporting of income changed: the costs of food remained the same, but the money taken in suddenly increased. Given the chance to explain this inconsistency, Mr. Samaroo could provide none. On the whole of the evidence a reasonable inference could be drawn by a trier of fact that the cash amounts put into the accounts and used to pay suppliers were unreported income from the businesses during the years in question and that the underreporting was deliberate.</P>
<P>59. By failing to properly analyse the elements of tax evasion, the trial judge erred in law in finding that the elements of the offence could not be met on the available evidence. A proper analysis of the available evidence demonstrates that the elements of tax evasion could be met by the prosecution at the time the charges were sworn. There is no evidence that any information was received after charges were laid which would have affected that assessment.</P>
<P>60. In summary, there was reasonable and probable cause to commence and continue the prosecution on an objective standard. Thus the order of the trial judge should be set aside. However, in the event this Court finds on an objective basis that reasonable and probable cause did not exist, the Appellant submits that the element of malice was not met on the evidence at trial.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>Malice or Improper Purpose</TI>
<P>61. Malicious prosecution is an intentional tort. Initiation of a prosecution without reasonable and probable cause is not sufficient to prove malicious prosecution; the plaintiff must also prove that the defendant set the criminal process in motion for an improper purpose, namely a purpose other than carrying the law into effect.
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 56; <CASEREF><SOC>Nelles v. Ontario</SOC><CITE>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 170</CITE><PARANUM>51</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>62. The core meaning of malice in the tort of malicious prosecution is the use of the criminal justice system for a purpose other than to bring an offender to justice and thereby aid in the enforcement of the law.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Oniel v. Toronto (Metropolitan) Police Force</SOC><CITE>2001 CanLII 24091</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[2001] O.J. No. 90</CITE><COURTJUR>ONCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, paras. 42&ndash;44.</P1></P>
<P>63. Whether a defendant acted with malice or improper purpose is a question of fact. The plaintiff must adduce evidence as to the defendant's state of mind. Acting on an honest yet mistaken belief that reasonable and probable cause did exist is not inconsistent with carrying the law into effect. As a result, if a defendant had a <EM>bona fide</EM> belief that proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be made out, he or she will have acted for the proper purpose of giving effect to the law and the claim of malicious prosecution must fail.
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 78-79, 85.</P1></P>
<P>64. Actions taken in furtherance of a prosecution cannot be the basis of a malicious prosecution claim, as those actions are not for a collateral or improper purpose. Mishandling a prosecution does not amount to malice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>McCreight v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 483 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>65. A plaintiff must prove that the defendant <EM>willfully</EM> perverted the criminal justice process. It is only where there is a fraud on the criminal justice process that malice can be said to exist. Malice does not include incompetence, inexperience, recklessness, gross negligence or poor judgment.
<P1><EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 78&ndash;80; <EM>Nelles</EM>, para. 55; <CASEREF><SOC>Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2001 SCC 66 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>35, 44-45</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>66. The trial judge held that &ldquo;proof of malice requires proof on a balance of probabilities that in the role of an investigator, Mr. Kendal acted deliberately to subvert and abuse his office&rdquo;: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 257. The trial judge held that this had been established, based on the following findings regarding Mr. Kendal:
<P1>a. he suppressed evidence and attributed evidence to witnesses that was not accurate;</P1>
<P1>b. he decided the Samaroos were guilty and set out to prove it even if to do so &ldquo;required a breach of his proper role and responsibilities&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>c. he knowingly misstated evidence essential to proof of the <EM>actus reus</EM>; and</P1>
<P1>d. he filed a misleading report knowing it would be relied upon to authorize the prosecution.</P1></P>
<P>67. The trial judge also relied on what he held to be indicators of &ldquo;an unfortunate culture&rdquo; within the CRA, including:
<P1>a. reference in the Primary Report to two factors supporting the case being referred to full investigation that: 1) restaurant and night club industries are those that have a high rate of non-compliance; and 2) that CRA had not prosecuted a business in the restaurant or nightclub industry in Nanaimo recently: AB 15: <EM>Primary Report</EM>;</P1>
<P1>b. the CRA publicizes convictions for tax evasion and &ldquo;boasts&rdquo; of an 89% conviction rate: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 259(d); and</P1>
<P1>c. the trial judge found that &ldquo;CRA was seeking substantial terms of imprisonment and significant penalties&rdquo; in imposing punitive damages: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 330.</P1></P>
<P>68. These conclusions regarding the CRA are errors in law and in fact. There was no evidence before the court to support these rulings.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>1</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Errors in The Findings of Fact Against Mr. Kendal</EM></TI>
<P>69. The trial judge held that Mr. Kendal misled the prosecutors as he did not tell them that Ms. Ferens she could not identify which till tape or shift she did or did not receive. This information was contained in Ms. Ferens' interview by Terry Finlay. The trial judge held that this was material information that would have impacted the prosecution decision as the case could not be proven without this evidence. He found that Mr. Kendal knew the case could not be proven based on the Finlay interview, and suppressed the information about that interview in order to have the case continue to move forward. He held that this established that Mr. Kendal initiated the prosecution for an improper purpose.
<P1><EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 197, 231</P1></P>
<P>70. There is no evidence that Mr. Kendal suppressed key information and thereby misled the prosecutors. The fact that Ms. Ferens was working from the daily summary sheets and not from till tapes is specifically noted or can be inferred from the following statements in the final Prosecution Report:
<P1>a. &ldquo;Debbie Ferens will be able to explain that from each completed &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; summary sheets, she would post the sales data to her monthly spreadsheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 251, Element #3, bullet 2;</P1>
<P1>b. &ldquo;Debbie Ferens <UNDER>will not be able to state that she knew which till tape shifts she received during the periods leading up to February 2006</UNDER>: the morning, the evening or the graveyard shifts, as she only posted the data from the filled out daily sales sheet summary provided to her with the till tapes from Tony Samaroo.&rdquo; (emphasis added): AB p. 251, Element #4, bullet 2;</P1>
<P1>c. &ldquo;Debbie Ferens (Witness #4) will be able to attest to using the information provided by the Samaroos from the &ldquo;Daily Cash Reports&rdquo; and posting this to her monthly spreadsheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 260, Element #10, bullet 3;</P1>
<P1>d. &ldquo;Debbie Ferens will be able to explain that from each days completed &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; summary sheets, she would post the sales data to her monthly spreadsheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 274, first bullet;</P1>
<P1>e. &ldquo;Debbie Ferens will be able to attest to using the information provided by the Samaroos and posting this to her monthly spreadsheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 274, Element #4 bullet 3;</P1>
<P1>f. &ldquo;Ferens received from Tony Samaroo a filled out &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; sheet listing only two till tapes of data per day, with the till tapes attached. Ferens posted from these &lsquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; sheets the applicable daily sales data onto the monthly summary sales sheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 335, second and third bullets;</P1>
<P1>g. &ldquo;The daily summary sheet used to only show 2 ring offs a day. The bookkeeper stated that she only posted 2 ring offs a day for the period under audit (lump sum total put on the monthly summary sheet)...&rdquo;: AB p. 360, second paragraph in entry for March 21, 2006;</P1>
<P1>h. &ldquo;the bookkeeper prepares a monthly revenue spreadsheet, crediting the various sales accounts and GST &amp; PST payable accounts, based on the &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; as provided to her from Samaroo, and not from the supporting till tapes themselves...&rdquo;: AB p. 451, para. (3);</P1></P>
<P>71. It is clear from these excerpts that the prosecution, Mr. Kendal and thence the defence had the same information about Ms. Ferens' expected testimony, including that she did not work from till tapes.</P>
<P>72. The information in these excerpts from the Prosecution Report is also not materially different from the statement Ms. Ferens gave to investigator Terry Finlay during the search which took place in January of 2007. The notes report Ms. Ferens as saying &ldquo;I don't post from the tapes because the daily sales sheet is adequate.&rdquo;
<P1>AB p.20, question 7</P1></P>
<P>73. The witness statement of Ms. Ferens disclosed at trial dated February 9, 2010 is also consistent with the prior statements. That witness statement includes the following:
<P1>a. &ldquo;Upon receipt of the daily cash report sheet form (sic) the client she would complete the form, by summarizing the amount for the day in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> column entitled &ldquo;Days Total&rdquo; for the days total of sales receipts.&rdquo;: AB p. 164, last paragraph;</P1>
<P1>b. &ldquo;She does not recall ever looking at the supporting till tape data that accompanies the &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; and the sales chits (for charge card sales) as there is no need to in order to do the bookkeeping from. (sic).&rdquo;: AB p. 165, first paragraph; and</P1>
<P1>c. &ldquo;She would then post from the &ldquo;Days Total&rdquo; sales receipts to a monthly spreadsheet...&rdquo;: AB p. 165, second to last paragraph.</P1></P>
<P>74. There is no evidence that at the time the charges were sworn the prosecutors expected that Ms. Ferens could identify which till tape or shift she did or did not receive. It is clear from the evidence that that the prosecution was fully aware that Ms. Ferens worked only from the daily summary sheets and could not identify which till tape or shifts were reflected in those summaries. There is no evidence to support a finding that this information was suppressed or withheld from the prosecutors. As a result there is no evidence that Mr. Kendal suppressed evidence in order to mislead the prosecutors into pursuing the prosecution.</P>
<P>75. Further, as noted in the analysis of reasonable and probable cause, the information about which till tape or shift was not reported to Ms. Ferens is immaterial. The <EM>actus reus</EM> is satisfied by the deliberate act of providing Ms. Ferens with inaccurate daily summary sheets which the Respondents knew would form the basis of their tax returns and therefore result in less tax owing. The inaccuracy of the daily summary sheets can be demonstrated by reference to the bank statements, business practices and available records. Which shift or till tape is only relevant to a determination of the amount of tax evaded, which is not an element of the offence.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>2</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Evidence as to Who Made the Prosecution Decision</EM></TI>
<P>76. The judge misapprehended the evidence when he concluded that Mr. Kendal was in effect responsible for the prosecution of the Respondents and not the Crown. This was due to his erroneous conclusions on the <EM>actus reus</EM> and reasonable and probable cause.</P>
<P>77. The prosecution of the Respondents was a public prosecution. It was therefore presumptively brought by the Attorney General of Canada or her delegated agents, in this case Mr. Jones, Ms. McLean and Ms. Hyman. The evidence demonstrates that these individuals had particular roles and responsibilities at various stages of the prosecution continuum.</P>
<P>78. Ms. McLean, Mr. Jones and Ms. Hyman all testified as to the process of assessing the information from the CRA against the PPSC charge approval standard, the decision as to whether to proceed summarily or by way of indictment, formalizing the charges, the decision on the initial sentencing position, and the relationship between in-house PPSC counsel and the agent appointed. The evidence clearly shows that the underlying decisions were made by the PPSC, in particular Ms. Hyman.</P>
<P>79. There was nothing nefarious about Mr. Kendal being in contact with the prosecutors and discussing the proposed charges and the relevant evidence. This is a normal result of being the investigator on the case. A public prosecutor necessarily depend on investigators for the information on which the case proceeds. In any criminal case it is the investigator who, through his summary of available evidence, identifies who is accused, of what offences, and what evidence supports the charges. In the case of tax evasion, the amounts alleged to have been evaded are calculated by the investigator based on available information, therefore the investigator will be the witness to prove the amounts.</P>
<P>80. There is no evidence that the role of Mr. Kendal was in any way outside the normal one for an investigator on such a case. The evidence of Ms. Hyman is that discussions with the investigators regarding the charges was part of the process as the CRA investigator and prosecutor must be in agreement that reasonable grounds existed in order for the investigator to swear the information. The investigator was also expected to set out information about potential defences so that the prosecution could consider them. Ms. McLean testified that the prosecutor relied on the investigators for information used to determine if charges would go forward, and could request further investigation if information was lacking. This indicates an expectation of ongoing interaction.
<P1>Ts. V. 3, p. 589, l. 44&mdash;p. 590, l. 15: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 2, p. 578, l. 20&ndash;29: <EM>Hyman;</EM> Ts. V. 1, p. 126, l. 17-p. 127, l. 2: <EM>McLean</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>81. The Respondents point to an email attaching 88 charges as evidence that the CRA drafted and swore the charges against them without any independent assessment by the prosecutors. However, the Information sworn against the Respondents had 21 charges and was drafted by Marsha Down, a lawyer in Mr. Jones' law firm.
<P1>Ts. V.3, p. 635, l.41&mdash;p. 636, l. 16: <EM>Jones</EM>; AB p. 126&ndash;131: <EM>Information</EM></P1></P>
<P>82. The testimony of Mr. Kendal, Ms. McLean, Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones was unanimous that the PPSC had the decision-making authority on whether a prosecution went ahead or not and on what basis.
<P1>Ts. V. 1, p. 125, l. 27&mdash;p. 126, l. 16: <EM>McLean</EM>; Ts. V. 2, p. 567, l. 33&mdash;p. 568, l. 10; p. 571, l. 16&mdash;p. 572, l. 10: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 630, l. 17&ndash;29: <EM>Jones</EM>; Ts. V. 2, p. 310, l. 12&ndash;28; p. 498, l. 3&mdash;p. 499, l. 26: <EM>Kendal</EM></P1></P>
<P>83. The evidence at trial is clear that the information relied on for assessing whether the prosecution standard had been met prior to charges being sworn came from the Prosecution Report. Both Janna Hyman and Brian Jones reviewed the Prosecution Report. Both held the view that prosecution was justified.
<P1>Ts. V. 2, p. 572, l. 44: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 596, l. 25&ndash;32; p. 600, l. 11&ndash;18;p. 620, l. 17&ndash;33: <EM>Hyman</EM>; Ts. V. 3, p. 641, l. 9&ndash;18: <EM>Jones</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>84. With respect to consideration of the <EM>actus reus</EM>, Brian Jones testified that he did not consider what in particular Ms. Ferens looked at to be the significant factor in the prosecution's case. Ms. Hyman testified that the evidence of Ms. Ferens went to how the evasion was being committed, namely to trace back from a filed tax return how the information got into the tax return, in this case by the bookkeeper inputting data received from Mr. Samaroo.
<P1>Ts. V. 3, p. 699, l.29&mdash;p. 700, l. 10: <EM>Jones;</EM> Ts. V. 2, p. 576, l. 33&ndash;577, l. 14<EM>: Hyman</EM></P1></P>
<P>85. In summary, the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding Mr. Kendal suppressed information and misled the prosecutors with respect to the evidence Ms. Ferens could provide, thereby subverting the prosecution process. When the whole of the evidence available at the relevant time is considered, it is clear that the prosecutors knew at the time the charges were sworn that Ms. Ferens could not identify which till tapes or shifts were recorded on the daily sales summaries received from Mr. Samaroo. That information was taken into account by the prosecutors in assessing whether the standard of reasonable prospect of conviction was met. As a result, there is no basis for finding that Mr. Kendal initiated an unfounded prosecution.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>3</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Mr. Kendal's Subjective Belief in Guilt</EM></TI>
<P>86. The trial judge found that Mr. Kendal acted with an improper purpose as he hoped to convict the Respondents because he believed they were guilty: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 257. Thus, Punnett J. accepted that Mr. Kendal believed in the Respondents' guilt and that his purpose was to bring them before a criminal court for trial. <EM>Miazga</EM> confirms that such a subjective belief will insulate a person from a malicious prosecution finding even when there is a lack of reasonable and probable cause where the person has a mistaken but honest belief that cause exists. This is because where a person acts with the subjective belief that the accused is guilty, the person is acting for a purpose consistent with that of a prosecution, namely bringing an accused before a court for determination of guilt or innocence. However, if the objective grounds for reasonable and probable cause is &ldquo;woefully inadequate&rdquo;, an absence of subjective believe may be inferred: <EM>Miazga</EM>, <UNDER>2009 SCC 51 (CanLII)</UNDER>, paras. 79-80.</P>
<P>87. In this case, the prosecutors assessed the evidence Mr. Kendal provided and found that it met the reasonable prospect of conviction standard. It was therefore reasonable for Mr. Kendal to believe the available evidence could prove the case. As noted above, when the test for tax evasion is properly applied, the evidence did objectively support reasonable and probable cause.</P>
<P>88. Mr. Kendal's subjective belief was therefore reasonably based. There is no evidence that it was not honestly held. As a result, there is no evidence supporting the trial judge's finding that he was acting for an improper purpose.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>4</EM>.</N><TI><EM>The Findings of Fact Against the CRA</EM></TI>
<P>89. With respect to the references to the CRA as an organization, there was no evidence at trial that consideration by the CRA of the factors referenced in the Primary Report or publication of convictions for tax evasion were inappropriate. If the whole of the Primary Report is considered, there is a detailed description of the alleged tax evasion by the Respondents, following which is the reference to these two additional factors. The trial judge does not indicate on what basis he concludes that these two factors are inappropriate for consideration or how they relate to the &ldquo;improper purpose&rdquo; attributed to Keith Kendal.</P>
<P>90. There is also no evidence that the Appellant sought or had any input into the initial sentencing position. The undisputed evidence of Mr. Jones and Ms. Hyman is that Ms. Hyman determined what sentence should be sought.</P>
<P>91. The Appellant has a mandate to support the enforcement of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>: <EM>Canada Revenue Agency Act</EM>, S.C. 1999, c. 17, s. 2 (definition of &ldquo;program legislation&rdquo;) and s. 5(1)(a). Investigating those suspected of tax evasion and recommending prosecution based on the available evidence is consistent with that statutory mandate. Deterring others from breaching the <EM>ITA</EM> by publicizing that persons have been convicted by a court of law is also consistent with that statutory mandate. There is no evidence to the contrary.</P>
<P>92. Mr. Kendal testified that when he referred the case to the PPSC he believed there was a case and that the Respondents were guilty: Ts. V. 2, p. 401, l. 3&ndash;12; p. 419, l. 31&ndash;38; p. 548, l. 15, - 31; p. 552, l. 13&ndash;19: <EM>Kenda</EM>l. This evidence shows he believed there was reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. There is no evidence that Mr. Kendal, in referring the case to the Crown for charge approval, had any purpose other than to have the Crown assess whether a criminal case should proceed to court. There are no grounds for a finding of improper purpose on the part of Mr. Kendal or, vicariously, on the part of the Appellant.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>E.</N><TI>Section 7 <EM>Charter</EM> Breach</TI>
<P>93. The trial judge held that the Appellant breached the Respondents' section 7 <EM>Charter</EM> rights by initiating the prosecution when it was wrongful to do so. He held that Mr. Kendal &ldquo;suppressed exculpatory evidence from the defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;created inculpatory evidence&rdquo; in order to obtain a conviction: <EM>Reasons</EM>, <UNDER>2018 BCSC 324 (CanLII)</UNDER>, para. 289. His judgment on section 7 reflects the same misunderstanding of the law and the evidence that led to his erroneous conclusions on the allegation of malicious prosecution.</P>
<BLOCK4><N>1.</N><TI><EM>No Exculpatory Evidence was Suppressed</EM></TI>
<P>94. The trial judge does not set out what &ldquo;exculpatory evidence&rdquo; was suppressed. The only evidence which Mr. Kendal allegedly suppressed related to what Ms. Ferens would say in testimony. That evidence related to whether the prosecutor could prove which till tape or shift was unreported, which was immaterial. It was not exculpatory evidence.</P>
<P>95. The explanations provided by the Respondents about where the cash came from was exculpatory evidence. It was included in the Prosecution Report along with the evidence as to why the investigator did not accept the explanations.
<P1>AB p. 277&ndash;282</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>2.</N><TI><EM>No Inculpatory Evidence was Created</EM></TI>
<P>96. The trial judge does not set out what inculpatory evidence was created. This appears to refer to Mr. Kendal adding to Ms. Ferens' will-say statement that she was expected to testify to only receiving one daily summary sheet from Mr. Samaroo.</P>
<P>97. The alteration of the will-say to reflect expected testimony without confirmation from the witness that she did in fact only receive one summary sheet per day is not an advisable practice. However and in any event, this was not material to the Crown's case. Regardless of how many daily summary sheets she received, the inculpatory aspect of Ms. Ferens' evidence is that the income reported in the tax returns derives from information provided to her by Mr. Samaroo. The Respondents did not dispute that she could give this evidence. Accordingly, there is no basis for a finding that inculpatory evidence was created by Mr. Kendal.</P>
<P>98. In the result, the Respondents failed to prove an absence of reasonable and probable cause. Nor did the Respondents prove that the CRA investigator withheld material evidence or misled the Crown in any way whatsoever or that he was motivated by any improper purpose.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="VI">PART 4&mdash;NATURE OF ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>99. The Appellant seeks an Order that:
<P1>a. the appeal be allowed and the trial judgment set aside; and</P1>
<P1>b. the Appellant receive the costs of the appeal and the trial below.</P1></P>
<P>100. The parties have agreed, in the event this Court dismisses the appeal, the legal costs of the defence at the criminal trial are reduced and settled at $287,221.77.</P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.</P>
<P>Dated at the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, this 29<SUP>th</SUP> day of June, 2018.</P>

Mr. Terry Finlay, an investigator with the CRA, interviews Deborah Ferens, the bookkeeper for the respondents. He does so based on pre-prepared, type written questions. Ms. Ferens tells Mr. Finlay that she does not look at the till tapes or source documents provided by the respondents. In other words, she does not know how many till tapes she is being provided with, or what information is represented on the daily sales summary sheet. Mr. Kendal testified that he understood her explanation to mean that she did not look at the till tapes and could not say whether she received two or three tapes, or what shifts they related to.</TBLCELL>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>This is a case in which the Crown failed to fulfill its prosecutorial responsibilities. Brian Jones too readily left control of the prosecution, disclosure, and decision making to Keith Kendal and the CRA, and Mr. Jones and PPSC failed to properly discharge their respective charge assessment and approval obligations. Mr. Jones relied on and deferred to Mr. Kendal and in doing so permitted the office of the Attorney General to become simply an extension of the CRA and Mr. Kendal. These failings permitted Keith Kendal to accomplish what he had set out from the inception of his investigation to achieve: to do everything within his power to ensure that the respondents were charged, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned.</P>
<P>The presumption of innocence was meaningless to Mr. Kendal. He assumed that the respondents were guilty of tax evasion. Mr. Kendal started with the deposits, and then worked backwards to manufacture a case against the respondents based on a theory of evasion Mr. Kendal knew could not be proved. Mr. Kendal acted deliberately to subvert and abuse his office, by supressing evidence and attributing evidence to witnesses that he knew was not accurate. Mr. Kendal knowingly misstated evidence essential to the proof of the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the alleged offences, prepared a misleading Prosecution Report knowing it would be relied upon by the Crown to determine if charges should proceed, and misled Lisa McLean at the PPSC as to the evidence that could be mustered in support of his theory. His clear intent was to see that criminal charges were laid and the respondents prosecuted irrespective of the evidence.</P>
<P>The appellant fails to address any of the key findings of fact made by the trial judge. The errors alleged by the appellant are based on a selective and distorted reading of the trial judge's Reasons for Judgment. Overall, the appellant's submission amounts to an invitation to this Court to ignore the findings of fact of the trial court below.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. The appellant's statement of facts is incomplete. The appellant ignores critical findings of fact made by the trial judge and misstates findings in ways that are misleading. It is important to note that at trial, the appellant also failed to address any of the evidence in support of the respondents' claim nor did the appellant address the &lsquo;key issue&rsquo; of what evidence ever existed to prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the alleged offences. Most of the Respondent's arugment is being made for the first time before this Court. The trial judge found:
<QUOTE><P>[201] The defence provided a 40 page written submission that canvased the legal issues raised. Curiously in both their written and oral submissions the defence chose not to address any of the facts that support the plaintiffs' claim of malicious prosecution nor did they address the key issue of the mechanics of the <EM>actus reus</EM>. Instead in their written submission they simply stated:
<QUOTE><P>There is no evidence in this case that displaces the presumption that reasonable and probable cause existed. Nor is there any evidence that any defendant acted for a purpose other than placing the case before the court for adjudication.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appeal Record (A.R.), p. 76, para. 201</P1></P>
<P>2. The respondents have set out below the key findings of fact as found by the trial judge.</P>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>A.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Civil Audit by the Canada Revenue and Referral for Criminal Investigation:</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. Beginning in March 2006, the appellant conducted a civil audit of the respondents. On March 21, 2006, Glen Foster, a civil auditor with the CRA, interviewed Deborah Ferens, the bookkeeper for the respondents. Ms. Ferens provided Mr. Foster with a copy of the daily sales summary sheet for the restaurant that showed three columns described as &ldquo;day&rdquo;, &ldquo;night&rdquo;, and &ldquo;days total&rdquo;. Mr. Foster recorded in his notes that Ms. Feren's told him as follows:
<QUOTE><P>the daily summary sheet used to only show 2 ring offs a day. The bookkeeper stated that she only posted 2 ring offs a day for the period under audit.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appeal Record (A.R.) p. 24/25, para. 14</P1></P>
<P>4. The appellant makes reference at paragraph 2 of their statement of facts to the respondents' having &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; their source documents, including till tapes. It must be emphasized that no adverse inference was drawn by the judge in the criminal trial from the fact that the daily sales summary sheet, till tapes, and other source documents were not retained by the respondents after the documents were returned to them by their bookkeeper. The judge in the criminal trial expressly declined to draw the adverse inference urged by the Crown in that trial, and apparently suggested by the appellant in this appeal&mdash;that the respondents deliberately destroyed their source documents. The criminal trial judge also noted that the allegation that the records may have been deliberately destroyed, together with other key allegations, were never put to Tony Samaroo by the Crown.
<P1>Appeal Book (&ldquo;A.B.&rdquo;), p. 152, para. 72. See also related para. 76.</P1></P>
<P>5. As found by the trial judge, Mr. Foster determined that during the audit period substantial cash deposits had been made to the respondents' business accounts. These deposits and their source precipitated, and were the foundation for, the criminal prosecution.
<P1>A.R. p. 25, para. 15</P1></P>
<P>6. Mr. Foster also interviewed Tony Samaroo and Mr. Ed Heese, the respondents' long standing accountant. Both Mr. Heese and Mr. Samaroo explained to Mr. Foster that the source of the deposits were cash savings that Mr. Samaroo had accumulated over many years. Mr. Heese and Mr. Samaroo explained that Mr. Samaroo, afraid that the banks would stop accepting old $100 bills, began depositing the bills into the business accounts. Mr. Heese confirmed that Mr. Samaroo told him in 2005 that he had started depositing his old $100 bills into his personal and corporate bank accounts, a year prior to the start of the civil audit.
<P1>A.R. p. 25, paras. 16 and 17</P1>
<P1>A.B. p. 147, para. 53</P1></P>
<P>7. Following the completion of the civil audit, on August 18, 2006, Glen Foster referred the case to the Enforcement Division of the CRA for a determination as to whether or not a criminal investigation would be undertaken. Alan Jones, team leader with the appellant, authored a &ldquo;Primary Report&rdquo; dated October 30, 2006, recommending that the case proceed to a full investigation, including that searches be conducted at the respondents' residence, three business locations, the accountant's office and the auditor's desk.
<P1>A.R. p. 25, para. 18</P1></P>
<P>8. Mr. Alan Jones wrote in his Primary Report that two other factors justified the case being selected for criminal investigation apart from the results of the civil audit:
<QUOTE><P>1. The restaurant and night club industries are those that have a high rate of non-compliance; and,</P>
<P>2. CRA has not prosecuted a business in the restaurant or nightclub industry in the Nanaimo area recently.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 25, para. 19</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>B.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>The Criminal Investigation and the Preparation of the Draft Prosecution Report:</UNDER></TI>
<P>9. On January 24, 2007, the search warrants in relation to the respondents' residence, businesses and the accountant's office were executed. Keith Kendal was assigned as the officer in charge regarding the search of the respondents' residence. Terry Finlay, another investigator with the CRA, was the officer in charge of the search of the accountant's office (Mr. Heese).
<P1>A.R. p. 26, para. 21</P1></P>
<P>10. During the course of the search of the accountant's office, Mr. Finlay interviewed Deborah Ferens, the respondents' bookkeeper. This was the second time she had been interviewed and the first time as part of the criminal investigation. Mr. Finlay recorded Ms. Ferens' answers on a sheet that had pre-prepared (typed) questions. He wrote that Ms. Ferens did not look at the till tapes provided to her (and thus did not know and could not say how many till tapes she was being provided with); she worked only from the daily sales summary sheet.
<P1>A.R. p. 26, para. 22</P1></P>
<P>11. Mr. Kendal was aware prior to the investigation being assigned to him that the CRA had no till tapes. He testified that following the search, the officers would have gathered for a scrum to discuss the searches and what evidence had been obtained. This would probably have included a review of the interview of Ms. Ferens.
<P1>A.R. p. 26/27, para. 23</P1></P>
<P>12. Mr. Kendal testified that he understood Ms. Ferens' explanation to Mr. Finlay to mean that she did not know how many till tapes were being provided to her by the respondents. She could not say whether she received two or three till tapes, nor what shifts they related to.
<P1>A.R. p. 27, para. 24</P1></P>
<P>13. As of January 27, 2007 the CRA knew that Ms. Ferens did not look at the till tapes and could not say whether the summary sheet included income from two or three shifts. At this point the CRA also knew that they did not have the till tapes or summary sheets for 2004 or 2005.
<P1>A.R. p. 82/83, para. 215</P1></P>
<P>14. In a working paper created approximately a month after the execution of the search warrants, Mr. Kendal wrote that he &ldquo;cannot show that only two ring ups (sic) were reported on 2004 &amp; 2005... Cannot prove 3<SUP>rd</SUP> shift wasn't reported so this would be meaningless&rdquo;. The appellant formally admitted that these statements accurately reflected Mr. Kendal's subjectively held view of the case at the time it was written.
<P1>A.R. p. 27, para. 25, 26</P1></P>
<P>15. Mr. Kendal did not prepare a will-say statement based on Ms. Ferens' interviews either by Mr. Foster or Mr. Finlay. He made no mention of her second interview, by Mr. Finlay, in either the draft Prosecution Report or the Final Prosecution Report nor did Mr. Kendal disclose the existence of Finlay's interview to Lisa McLean or Jana Hyman at PPSC. He testified that Mr. Brian Jones was &lsquo;presumably&rsquo; aware if its existence but denied telling Mr. Jones about it.
<P1>A.R., p. 64, para. 152</P1></P>
<P>16. Mr. Kendal was responsible for disclosure during the prosecution and he prepared and disclosed all 88 binders of disclosure. Mr. Kendal also chose not to disclose the notes of Mr. Finlay's interview of Ms. Ferens in the witness statement binder provided to the respondents. Instead, he placed it in a large binder of search materials referred to in the criminal trial as Binder &ldquo;D&rdquo;. There was no reference to the interview or the notes in the table of contents of Binder &ldquo;D&rdquo;. Unless there was an issue related to the searches, which there was not, there would be no reason to review Binder &ldquo;D&rdquo;.
<P1>A.R. p. 64, para. 153 and p. 67, para. 164</P1></P>
<P>17. Following the creation of his working paper, Mr. Kendal prepared his draft Prosecution Report. Despite being aware that Deborah Ferens could not say how many till tapes she was being provided with, in the draft Prosecution Report, Mr. Kendal wrote:
<QUOTE><P>Interviews with the bookkeeper will show that she only received two till tapes per day from the Samaroos, not the three that were actually produced in the normal course of the business day.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 28, para. 28</P1></P>
<P>18. Mr. Kendal also wrote that the respondents only provided 2 of the three till tapes per day to their bookkeeper, Ms. Ferens, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Debbie Ferens has stated to the auditor that she only ever received two till tapes from the Samaroos to do the books of MGM (see witness report #1 for the auditor Glen Foster). Debbie Ferens will be contacted and interviewed to confirm this statement. In addition she will be contacted to confirm if she received 3 till tapes per day during the 2007 fiscal period of MGM.</P></QUOTE>

<P>19. Mr. Kendal forwarded his draft Prosecution Report to Brian Jones, who in turn provided it to Lisa McLean at PPSC. Ms. McLean spoke with Brian Jones by telephone on January 7, 2008 and then with Mr. Kendal on January 10, 2008. She recorded in her notes of the call with Mr. Kendal that he told her:
<QUOTE><P>He can show he's got it; can't really show when earned it.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>20. And under a heading called &ldquo;Bkkpr&rdquo; she wrote:
<QUOTE><P>He has not interviewed her. She takes the z tapes and posts to spreadsheet.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. pp. 29, 30, paras. 34-35</P1></P>
<P>21. Mr. Kendal did not reference Ms. Ferens' second interview in his January 10, 2008 call with Ms. McLean.
<P1>A.R. p. 83, para. 217</P1></P>
<P>22. Ms. McLean prepared a draft charge approval memorandum dated January 14, 2008. The memorandum reflected her thought process and position following her review of the draft Prosecution Report and after consultation with Bruce Harper (her team leader at PPSC) and Jana Hyman (a colleague at PPSC). Both Mr. Harper and Ms. Hyman agreed with her views on the file.
<P1>A.R. p. 31, para. 40</P1></P>
<P>23. Ms. McLean's draft charge approval memorandum clearly states that while PPSC was of the view that charges were appropriate, they should not be approved until further investigative steps were taken, including an interview of Ms. Ferens. Ms. McLean then spoke to Mr. Kendal on January 14, 2008. In her notes she identifies the following necessary investigative steps to be completed before charges could be approved, which she communicated to Mr. Kendal:
<QUOTE><P>Interview bookkeeper
<P1>a) last person to see z tapes</P1>
<P1>b) what did they show date &amp; times. Breakdown by</P1>
<P1>c) what did she do</P1>

<P1>e) did both ts and hs deal with her. What were their roles</P1></P>
<P>He agreed with that. He will:
<P1>1) Will interview bookkeeper;</P1>
<P1>2) employees</P1>
<P1>3) Finish RTCC</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 32, para. 46</P1></P>
<P>24. As found by the trial judge, Ms. McLean was operating on the assumption, based on the information received from Mr. Kendal, that Ms. Ferens did see the till tapes and could confirm that not all income from the restaurants was being reported.
<P1>A.R. p. 33, para. 47</P1></P>
<P>25. It is significant that three senior lawyers within PPSC were of the opinion that no charges should be approved until the investigative tasks identified by Ms. McLean were completed, including the interview of Ms. Ferens.

<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>D.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Completion of the Prosecution Report, Preparation of the Information and Charge Approval:</UNDER></TI>
<P>26. Mr. Kendal did not interview Ms. Ferens as directed by PPSC. He contacted Mr. Heese and Ms. Ferens to arrange an interview and was subsequently advised that all further requests for information should be directed through their counsel, Mr. George Jones.
<P1>A.R. p. 34, para. 52</P1></P>
<P>27. Mr. Kendal spoke again to Ms. McLean on February 11, 2008, and he told her that the bookkeeper did not want to be interviewed. He did not say that Ms. Ferens had agreed to answer questions through her counsel. He failed to disclose Mr. Finlay's interview or that Ms. Ferens had been clear that she could not provide evidence that a shift was unreported, or if that had been the case, which one.
<P1>A.R. p. 34, para. 54</P1></P>
<P>28. On March 20, 2008, the CRA provided PPSC with Mr. Kendal's final Prosecution Report, together with a covering letter which Mr. Kendal authored. The letter states that the CRA was alleging that the respondents appropriated $1,754,812.00 from their corporate businesses during the years 2004 to 2006. And that the sales belonging to the restaurant were suppressed by the respondents providing only two of three till tapes per day to their bookkeeper.
<P1>A.R. p. 34, para. 55</P1></P>
<P>29. In the final Prosecution Report, under the heading &ldquo;Part V&mdash;Theory of the Case&rdquo;, Mr. Kendal wrote:
<QUOTE><P>Scheme 1: Tony &amp; Helen Samaroo operated three regular shifts at the MGM restaurant and each shift produced a rung off till tape. The Samaroos under reported sales revenue &amp; the related GST from MGM Restaurants Ltd. by not providing one of the three daily till tapes to their bookkeeper resulting in a personal enrichment of about $50,000 per month.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 35, para. 56</P1></P>
<P>30. And, under &ldquo;Element 3&rdquo; of the CRA's theory of the case Mr. Kendal wrote:
<QUOTE><P>- The bookkeeper Debbie Ferens (witness #4), will be able to explain that she received a filled out preformatted &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; summary sheet for each day of the month with till tape #1 sales data, till tape #2 sales data and a summary column of those two days till tapes, and this is attached with the till tapes for that month as provided to her by Tony Samaroo...</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 35, para. 60</P1></P>
<P>31. And under &ldquo;Element 4&rdquo; Mr. Kendal wrote:
<QUOTE><P>Element #4: The accused provided only two of three daily till tapes to their bookkeeper Debbie Ferens to February 28, 2006.</P>
<P>- Deborah Ferens (witness #4) will be able to attest to having met the CRA auditor, Glen Foster on March 21st of 2006, and informed him that she has only ever received two MGM till tapes per day from Tony Samaroo for the period under audit.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 36, para. 61</P1></P>
<P>32. As found by the trial judge:
<QUOTE><P>[230] I conclude that despite what he said in his Prosecution Report, Mr. Kendal understood that the theory that only two till tapes were being reported could not be proved by the sales summary sheets and that Ms. Ferens could not testify to that. He clearly appreciated that the summary sheets could include information from three ring-offs or shifts. In his evidence he confirmed that he knew the daily sales summary sheet showed two columns of data but did not know how many till tapes it represented and in particular whether it represented two or three till tapes or shifts.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>E.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Drafting of the Information and Charge Approval:</UNDER></TI>
<P>33. The trial judge found that the charges against the respondents were not &lsquo;approved&rsquo; until June 2008, when Keith Kendal swore the 21-count Information. Neither Ms. Jana Hyman nor Mr. Jones prepared any written analysis of the case nor did the two ever discuss the legal reasoning of the case. Mr. Kendal drafted the information and swore it, without the final draft having been reviewed by anyone within PPSC or Mr. Brian Jones. Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones relied on Keith Kendal to gather the evidence, draft the final Information, and essentially, do charge approval.
<P1>A.R. p. 74, para. 193, and p. 75, paras. 195&ndash;197</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>F.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>2010 Interviews of Deborah Ferens and Diane Ye:</UNDER></TI>
<P>34. It is critical to note that the appellant makes no mention in their statement of facts of Mr. Kendal's 2010 interviews of Ms. Ferens and Ms. Ye nor do they challenge the trial judge's findings of fact in relation to these matters.</P>
<P>35. In early 2010, Mr. Brian Jones instructed Keith Kendal to interview Ms. Ferens again. Mr. Kendal prepared 41 pages of questions before that interview, which took place on January 22, 2010. The questions have the appearance of Mr. Kendal seeking to obtain from Ms. Ferens the evidence he wanted from her and had already attributed to her.
<P1>A.R. p. 64, para. 154</P1></P>
<P>36. Ms. Ferens told Mr. Kendal that she thought (assumed) that the daily sales summary sheet had two columns (day and night) because it reflected information from two shifts, but she repeated what she had told Mr. Finlay on January 24, 2007, which is that she never looked at the supporting till tapes and could not say how many, or which ones, she received.
<P1>A.R. p. 65, para. 155</P1></P>
<P>37. The will-say statement of Deborah Ferens' January 22, 2010 interview was typed up on February 9, 2010. Then, on February 16, 2010, Mr. Kendal interviewed Diane Ye for the third time. It is significant that in her first two interviews, she states that she received a single daily sales summary sheet, and that the summary sheet columns were labelled &ldquo;day&rdquo; and &ldquo;night&rdquo;. Not, &ldquo;till tape #1&rdquo; and &ldquo;till tape #2&rdquo; as Mr. Kendal had written in the Prosecution Report.
<P1>A.R. p. 65, paras. 156&ndash;158</P1></P>
<P>38. During the third interview of Ms. Ye, she is recorded as having said, for the first time, that she actually received two daily sales summary sheets. One for the &lsquo;day&rsquo; and &lsquo;night&rsquo; shifts, and a separate sheet used solely for the &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo; shift.
<P1>A.R. p. 65,66, paras. 159&ndash;161.</P1></P>
<P>39. Mr. Kendal testified that the first time the existence of a second daily sales summary sheet entered his mind was when it was disclosed by Ms. Ye during her third interview. While the interview notes of Ms. Ferens' interview show she was never asked about a second sheet, her will say states that she only ever received one sheet. Mr. Kendal explained that after he was told about a second sheet by Diane Ye, he went back and altered Ms. Ferens' will-say to include the corroborative statement that she only received a single sheet. As the trial judge found: &ldquo;Mr. Kendal seemed to think this was perfectly acceptable&rdquo;.
<P1>A.R. p. 66, para. 162</P1></P>
<P>40. Surprisingly, the appellant describes Mr. Kendal's actions in manufacturing evidence and attributing it to Deborah Ferens as &ldquo;not an advisable practice&rdquo;, but they go on to say that in any event, it did not matter because the evidence was &lsquo;not material&rsquo;: appellant's factum, p. 29, para. 97.</P>
<P>41. The trial judge took a different view. He found that Mr. Kendal hoped that if he interviewed Ms. Ferens for a third time, he could obtain the evidence from her that he had already wrongfully attributed to her in the Prosecution Report. It was clear that he anticipated getting her to say that she only got two till tapes for each day. The trial judge also found that Mr. Kendal's approach to his interview of Ms. Ferens was telling, given he had earlier misreported that Ms. Ferens had refused to be interviewed. The trial judge found: &ldquo;I conclude that it was important to him to interview her personally as he sought to support the evidence he had attributed to her throughout&rdquo;.
<P1>A.R. pp. 85-86, paras. 221&ndash;226</P1></P>
<P>42. On March 3, 2010, Mr. Kendal provided copies of both the will-say statements of Ms. Ye and Ms. Ferens to Brian Jones, and Mr. Jones testified he probably reviewed them that day. His time sheet entries show that he spent 1.5 hours reviewing the documents and speaking to Mr. Kendal about them.
<P1>A.R. p. 67, paras. 163 and 166.</P1></P>
<P>43. Although Mr. Kendal had been responsible for disclosure throughout the prosecution, he did not disclose the will-say statements to the respondents. For reasons that were not explained, he testified that the decision to disclose them rested with Mr. Jones because they were the Crown's &lsquo;property&rsquo;. In fact, the will-say statements of Ms. Ferens and Ms. Ye were not disclosed to the respondents until the second day of the criminal trial, and only after the Crown was ordered to provide particulars of the overt acts of evasion being alleged against the respondents.
<P1>A.R. p. 67, para. 164</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>G.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>The Criminal Trial:</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. The criminal trial began on September 20, 2010.Mr. Jones outlined the Crown's case and told the criminal trial judge that theory of the Crown was that the respondents were providing only two of the three daily till tapes to their bookkeeper, Ms. Ferens. He told the court: &ldquo;... the bookkeeper until the audit is announced receives only two ring offs each day prior to the audit&rdquo;. No mention is made of Ms. Ye's evidence in relation to the supposed existence of a second daily sales summary sheet.
<P1>A.R. p. 68, paras. 170, 171</P1></P>
<P>45. Following the Crown's opening, the respondents applied for particulars of what the Crown was alleging were the overt acts of evasion. The criminal trial judge ordered particulars, which the Crown provided the next day. The trial judge found that those particulars did no more than repeat what the Crown had put forward as its theory based on missing till tapes; it did not particularize the overt acts.
<P1>A.R. p. 70, paras. 176,177</P1></P>
<P>46. Immediately after filing the particulars, the Crown disclosed, for the first time, the will-say statements of the 2010 interviews of Ms. Ferens and Ms. Ye.
<P1>A.R. p. 70, para. 178</P1></P>
<P>47. The following day, the respondents again applied for further particulars. In the course of resisting the application, Mr. Jones told the court as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The position of the Crown is and always has been that it's Mr. Samaroo giving these [sic] only two till tapes instead of three to Ms. Ferens, the bookkeeper, knowing that that raw data will be transferred into a monthly sales statement, monthly revenue statement, that will be transferred into an annual revenue statement, which will find its way into eventually a tax return. That's always been the Crown's position. That's always been what this disclosure previously has been about.</P>
<P>[183] Mr. Jones then read from the Prosecution Report:</P>
<P>Now, I have a theory as to how they did it and that theory&mdash;that theory was put in writing, in black and white, in the Crown brief that was given to defence at or about the first appearance in court of Mr. Samaroo. That was years ago. Can I just read, if I may, from the Crown brief that was given to defence. Part 5, theory of the case. And for my friends' benefit, it's at page six of 50 of Tab 1, binder F, the prosecution report. Part 5, theory of the case [as read in]:
<QUOTE><P>Scheme 1. Tony and Helen Samaroo operated three regular shifts at the M.G.M. Restaurant and each shift produced a rung-off till tape. The Samaroos under-reported sales revenue and the related GST from M.G.M. Restaurants Limited by not providing one of the three daily till tapes to their bookkeeper, resulting in a personal enrichment of about $50,000 per month.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The theory of the Crown, black and white, given to defence years ago. So it's not just me standing on my two feet today, Your Honour, stating what the theory is. Always been the theory.</P>
<P>And that theory&mdash;that Scheme 1 is then broken down into various elements, talking about what we understood people were doing. But the theory's always been there.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 71/72, paras. 182, 183</P1></P>
<P>48. However, in his closing submissions before the criminal trial judge, Mr. Jones made no mention of Ms. Ferens' unreported till tape theory&mdash;the Crown's position, in &lsquo;black and white&rsquo;, for the previous two years&mdash;instead taking the position, for the first time, that the overt act of evasion now being alleged by the Crown was based on Diane Ye's &lsquo;missing second sheet&rsquo; theory.
<P1>A.R. p. 96, 97, paras.266&ndash;268</P1></P>
<P>49. When asked to described how it could be that Mr. Samaroo had committed the overt acts, Mr. Jones explained it was &ldquo;magic&rdquo;.
<P1>A.R. p. 97, para. 267</P1></P>
<P>50. On April 6, 2011, the respondents were acquitted of all charges.</P>
<P>51. While the trial judge did not find Mr. Jones liable for malicious prosecution, and the respondents accept that finding, the trial judge did find that Mr. Jones' failure to fulfill all of his obligations as Crown caused him to give up control of the prosecution to Mr. Kendal and the CRA, and in doing so, risked a miscarriage of justice.
<P1>A.R. p. 101, para. 281.</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ISSUES ON APPEAL</TI>
<P>52. The appellant raises four issues on this appeal, as follows:
<P1>a. That the trial judge erred in law in holding that the manner of fraud and the quantum of unreported income were necessary elements of proof of the offence of tax evasion;</P1>
<P1>b. That the trial judge erred in law by requiring the appellant to prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of tax evasion in order to establish reasonable and probable cause;</P1>
<P1>c. That the trial judge erred in law in finding that the circumstances known to the Crown prosecutor at the relevant time could not establish reasonable and probable cause to commence a prosecution; and,</P1>
<P1>d. That the trial judge erred in fact and in law in finding that the CRA investigator supressed or withheld materiel evidence from the Crown and that he was therefore motivated by malice.</P1></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>The respondents' position in respect to the points in issue on this appeal:</EM></TI>
<P>53. Issues 1, 2, and 3, all relate to the third element of the tort of malicious prosecution: the existence of reasonable and probable cause to initiate or continue the prosecution against the respondents. The trial judge made no error of law in finding that reasonable and probable cause did not exist. He correctly set out the law in respect to the tort of malicious prosecution, and in respect to tax evasion. The trial judge correctly applied the law to the facts in finding that the charges against the respondents were founded on an assumption, and grounded in mere suspicion and hypotheses, which did not and could not constitute reasonable and probable cause as that term is uniquely defined in the tort of malicious prosecution.</P>
<P>54. Issue 4 relates to the trial judge's finding that Mr. Kendal was motivated by malice. The trial judge correctly found that Mr. Kendal acted deliberately to supress evidence and attribute evidence to witnesses that was not accurate. The trial judge correctly found that Mr. Kendal decided from the beginning that the Samaroos were guilty and set out to prove that was the case even if doing so required a breach of his proper role and responsibilities.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3&mdash;ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>A.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Standard of Review:</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. Issues 1, 2, and 3 are questions of law reviewable on a correctness standard.</P>
<P>56. Issue 4 is described by the appellant as involving an error in law and in fact. The appellant takes the position that there was &lsquo;no evidence&rsquo; and there were &lsquo;no grounds&rsquo; for a finding of malice in respect to Mr. Kendal: appellant's factum, p. 28, para. 92. There is no dispute that it is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no supporting evidence: <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>25</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>57. The respondents submit that while the appellant is seeking to couch their objection as a question of law, in effect the appellant takes issue with the trial judge's assessment of the significant volume of evidence tendered in relation to the issue of whether Mr. Kendal was motiviated by malice, and so the standard of palpable and overriding error applies.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>B.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Issues 1, 2, and 3:</UNDER></TI>
<P>58. Issues 1, 2, and 3 all relate to the trial judge's findings of law in respect to the third element of the tort of malicious prosecution, and are dealt with together in the respondents' factum.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The trial judge correctly determined that there was no reasonable and probable cause to initiate or continue the prosecution:</EM></TI>
<P>59. At para. 130 of his reasons, the trial judge correctly summarized the law in relation to the issue of &lsquo;reasonable and probable cause&rsquo; as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Miazga:</EM>
<QUOTE><P>[130] However the proper test for reasonable and probable grounds to be applied to the tort of malicious prosecution is as summarized by the Supreme Court in <EM>Miazga</EM>:</P>
<P>a) The tort of malicious prosecution &ldquo;targets the decision to initiate or continue with a criminal prosecution&rdquo; (para. 6);</P>
<P>b) The tort of malicious prosecution is &ldquo;designed to provide redress for losses flowing from an unjustified prosecution&rdquo; (para. 42);</P>
<P>c) The elements of the tort are the same no matter the parties: para. 44;</P>
<P>d) The &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; requirement identifies the appropriate target of the suit: para. 53.</P>
<P>e) <UNDER>Given the burden of proof in a criminal trial, &ldquo;probable guilt&rdquo; means that, on an objective assessment, based on the existing state of circumstances, proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be made out in a court of law: para. 63.</UNDER></P>
<P>f) Reasonable and probable cause is a question of law to be decided by the judge: para. 74. This means that the subjective state of mind of the defendants is not a relevant consideration hence there is no unfairness in applying the same test to both an investigator and prosecutor. The question is whether the prosecution was properly initiated.</P>
<P>g) There is no &ldquo;sliding scale&rdquo; for reasonable and probable cause depending on who the defendants are. The test is the same in any public prosecution.</P>
<P>h) If the court determines that no objective grounds existed for the prosecution at the relevant time then the court must consider the fourth element, that of malice: para. 77.
<P1>[Emphasis added]</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 54/55. para. 130</P1></P>
<P>60. With respect, the issue of reasonable and probable cause is straightforward. The appellant and Crown alleged that the respondents' evaded tax in 2004 and 2005, by providing only 2 of the 3 daily till tapes to their bookkeeper, Deborah Ferens. The evidence of Deborah Ferens was necessary to prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offences. Without her evidence, reasonable and probable cause did not exist to initiate the prosecution. The position taken by PPSC and communicated to Mr. Kendal was that absent Ms. Ferens' evidence, charges could not be approved. Her evidence was essential to prove that the funds in question were unreported income earned during the period of the Information. As the trial judge correctly found, Deborah Ferens' evidence could not prove the <EM>actus reus</EM>. She had no idea how many till tapes she was being provided with or what information was represented in the daily sales summary sheet. All she knew was that the sheet contained three columns: one labelled &lsquo;day&rsquo;, one labelled &lsquo;night&rsquo; and one labelled &lsquo;days total&rsquo;. As such, there was no reasonable and probable cause to initiate the prosecution. Mr. Kendal knew this from the outset of his investigation. Rather than admit it, he set out to manufacture a case against the respondents to ensure charge approval and prosecution. In doing so he created evidence in relation to Deborah Ferens that he knew did not exist and actively suppressed her actual evidence, given to Mr. Finlay, from the PPSC to ensure charges were approved.</P>
<P>61. It is submitted that the trial judge was correct in finding that there was no reasonable and probable cause to initiate the prosecution, which he summarized as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[244] To summarize, the defendants had no evidence to prove, and knew they could not prove, whether the plaintiffs were providing only two of the three till tapes to Ms. Ferens, or which of the three till tapes. This meant they could not prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offence of tax evasion, nor could they ever hope to prove the quantum of the evasion. As in <EM>Proulx</EM>, the charges against the Samaroos were founded on an assumption, and grounded in mere suspicion and hypotheses, which did not and could not constitute reasonable and probable cause as that term is uniquely defined in the tort of malicious prosecution.</P>
<P>[245] This prosecution should never have proceeded. It was undertaken without reasonable and probable cause. The third element required by <EM>Miazga</EM> is satisfied as against all defendants.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 90, paras. 244,245</P1></P>
<P>62. The merits of the other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; pointed to by the appellant as being capable of establishing reasonable and probable cause must be considered bearing in mind that Mr. Kendal's investigation of the respondents was tainted from the outset.</P>
<P>63. The trial judge found that Mr. Kendal did not start from a neutral position and then undertake an objective investigation. He saw his investigative task to be discrediting the respondents' explanation of the source of funds. From the outset, Mr. Kendal rejected the explanations of Mr. Samaroo and Mr. Heese for the accumulation of cash. He started out with the assumption that the deposits and cash payments were made with suppressed income skimmed from the businesses. And, Mr. Kendal set out, not to conduct an impartial investigation, but to in his own words, &lsquo;deflect the defence of a lifetime of savings&rsquo; and to &lsquo;defuse the Defence position&rsquo;. The appellant does not challenge these findings.</P>
<P>64. Kendal could prove the respondents had the money, but he knew he could not prove whether it was skimmed, when it was skimmed, how it was skimmed, or from which business. Mr. Kendal developed a theory to explain the source of the deposits&mdash;that the respondents were not providing one daily till tape to their bookkeeper. But, as he admitted in his &ldquo;Investigations Plan&mdash;MGM&rdquo;, he knew from the beginning he could not prove that one shift was not being reported to Deborah Ferens in 2004 and 2005. Mr. Kendal knew that Deborah Ferens could not and would not testify that she only received 2 till tapes per day.</P>
<P>65. When Mr. Kendal created his draft and final Prosecution Reports, he did so knowing that the Crown would rely on the information he provided to determine whether the prosecution would proceed. Bear in mind that at the same time Kendal prepared the other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; in the draft and final Prosecution Reports, he was actively suppressing the Finlay interview from PPSC and manufacturing evidence that he attributed to Ms. Ferens. It is respectfully submitted that he was also engaging in what judge Saunders called &lsquo;voodoo&rsquo; accounting. He created hundreds of working papers, based on faulty extrapolations and assumptions&mdash;coming to entirely different results than Glen Foster&mdash;in an attempt to explain the source of the deposits and cash payments. This was an attempt to build a case and secure a conviction. These purported other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; are merely a part of Mr. Kendal's continuing efforts to manufacture a case against the respondents, used to prop up the evidence he manufactured and attributed to Deborah Ferens&mdash;when he knew that he could not prove the third shift was not being reported from the beginning of the investigation.</P>
<P>66. Mr. Kendal's own views of the merits of his other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; is revealed by his treatment of Ms. Ferens' &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; in his dealings with PPSC and in his reports, and confirmed by his approach to the 2010 interviews of Ms. Ferens and Ms. Ye. Mr. Kendal knew that Ms. Ferens' evidence was necessary to prove the offences, and he was told in no uncertain terms by PPSC that without confirmation of her testimony, there would be insufficient evidence to support charge approval. Instead of pointing out to PPSC the other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; that he included in his prosecution reports as an alternative basis upon which charges could be approved, he instead went to great lengths to suppress the Finlay interview from PPSC; he created evidence and attributed it to Ms. Ferens; and, he misled Lisa McLean about Ms. Ferens' willingness to be interviewed.</P>
<P>67. Perhaps the most critical evidence confirming the lack of reasonable and probable cause to proceed with the prosecution is found in the notes of Ms. McLean of her telephone call with Mr. Kendal on January 10, 2008 where she wrote what Kendal told her about the sufficiency of the evidence:
<QUOTE><P>He can show he's got it; can't really show when earned it.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 29, para. 34</P1></P>
<P>68. What Ms. McLean did not know was that Deborah Ferens had at this point already been interviewed by Mr. Finlay and had confirmed that she could not provide the evidence that Mr. Kendal had already wrongfully attributed to her. Ms. McLean was led to believe that Ms. Ferens had yet to be interviewed as part of the investigation, and it was a simple matter of Mr. Kendal &lsquo;confirming&rsquo; her evidence to Mr. Foster that she only ever received two till tapes per day during the period in question. Of course, she had not said that. Mr. Kendal had created that evidence and attributed it to her.</P>
<P>69. Further, as found by the trial judge, the appellant's position on this appeal&mdash;that Ms. Ferens' evidence was immaterial to proving the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offences&mdash;is inconsistent with the testimony of the appellant's own witnesses and of Lisa McLean. It is directly contrary to Ms. McLean's position taken on behalf of PPSC in her draft charge approval memorandum (the only written legal analysis ever prepared by the Crown) which was agreed to and adopted by Jana Hyman and Bruce Harper at PPSC. And, it is inconsistent with the basis upon which charges were approved and upon which the prosecution was initiated and proceeded to trial.</P>
<P>70. The trial judge was entitled to rely on the evidence led by the appellant at trial, on the contents of the prosecution report, and on the evidence of Lisa McLean, that the <EM>actus reus</EM> or overt acts of the alleged offences was that the respondents were providing only 2 of 3 till tapes to Deborah Ferens during the period of the offences, and that Deborah Ferens' evidence was necessary to prove the <EM>actus reus</EM> of the offences. With respect, it is not open to the appellant to effectively attempt to impeach its own witnesses on this appeal.</P>
<P>71. Further, even if this court were to turn a blind eye to Mr. Kendal's conduct and the unchallenged context in which the other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; were created, reasonable and probable cause is not made out. As found by the trial judge, even if the other facts give rise to a suspicion: &ldquo;it comes no where near meeting the evidentiary requirement of proving that within the alleged time frame the money was skimmed from the restaurant. It is a theory, a suspicion, and convictions are not entered on theories or suspicions&rdquo;. A.R. p. 81, para. 207.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>The trial judge applied the correct legal principles and did not reverse the onus of proof in respect to reasonable and probable cause:</EM></TI>
<P>72. The trial judge's decision comprises 102 pages and 340 paragraphs. He thoroughly canvassed the evidence, clearly set out his findings of fact, correctly set out the relevant legal principles, and then carefully and considerately applied the law to the facts. At paragraphs 98&ndash;105 of his reasons (A.R. pp. 46&ndash;48), the trial judge correctly set out the law in relation to tax evasion and noted that the obligation on the Crown was to prove both the <EM>mens rea</EM> and <EM>actus reus</EM> of the alleged offences beyond a reasonable doubt. And, the trial judge correctly set out the law in relation to the issue of reasonable and probable cause&mdash;the third element of the tort of malicious prosecution&mdash;at paragraphs 117 to 130 of his reasons (A.R. pp. 51&ndash;54).</P>
<P>73. With respect, when the trial judge's findings in relation to reasonable and probable cause are read in the context of the reasons as a whole, it is apparent that he understood and applied the correct legal principles including the correct onus of proof.</P>
<P>74. By pointing out that the criminal trial judge rejected most, if not all of the other &lsquo;facts&rsquo; suggested by the appellant, and noting that the appellant did not prove any of those facts during the trial, the trial judge was merely highlighting the obvious defiencies of the &lsquo;other facts&rsquo;. The trial judge was alive to the fact that Mr. Kendal included those calculations and conclusions in his report not in the capacity of an objective investigator, but as an advocate determined to manufacture a case against the respondents and ensure charge approval and prosecution. A reading of the trial judge's reasons as a whole make it apparent that the trial judge found on the evidence that the respondent's had proved an absence of reasonable and probable cause.</P>
<P>75. Further, the trial judge's reference to the lack of any explanation as to how Helen Samaroo was involved in the alleged scheme of evasion is correct. At no point during the prosecution of the respondents or during the malicious prosecution trial was an explanation ever offered as to how Mrs. Samaroo may have been involved in allegedly supressing information from Deborah Ferens. Lisa McLean states in her draft charge approval memorandum that in her view, on behalf of PPSC, Helen Samaroo should not be charged with either corporate evasion or personal evasion:
<QUOTE><P>A.B. pp. 63 (bottom third) and 64 (bottom third). No other written legal analysis of the merits of proceeding against Mrs. Samaroo was ever created.</P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N><UNDER>C.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Issue 4:</UNDER></TI>
<P>76. The appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in fact and in law in finding that Mr. Kendal suppressed or withheld material evidence from the Crown, and that he was therefore motivated by malice.</P>
<P>77. First, the appellant is mistaken in suggesting that the trial judge's finding of malice in relation to Mr. Kendal was based only on the fact that Mr. Kendal suppressed evidence (appellant's factum, p. 22, para. 69). The trial judge found, at paragraph 247 of his reasons (A.R. p. 91) that from the inception of Mr. Kendal's investigation he rejected outright the explanations provided by Mr. Samaroo about the source of the cash deposits. Mr. Kendal created a working paper shortly after the execution of the search warrants in which he sets out his plan to &ldquo;deflect the defence of a lifetime of savings&rdquo; and &ldquo;defuse&rdquo; the respondents' position. The trial judge correctly found that Mr. Kendal:
<QUOTE><P>...had his mind made up from the beginning and set out to have the plaintiffs charged and convicted. His sole interest was to collect incriminating evidence and to discount or ignore evidence that did not support his prejudgment. He saw his investigative task as not to fairly examine and report the evidence of the plaintiffs but instead to discredit it.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 91, para. 247</P1></P>
<P>78. It is critical to note that the appellant does not challenge this finding of the trial judge. Nor does the appellant challenge the trial judge's finding that Mr. Kendal began with the deposits of cash and worked backwards in an attempt to develop a theory of how the tax evasion had occurred.</P>
<P>79. The appellant makes reference to various statements in the final Prosecution Report that they say are proof Mr. Kendal &lsquo;disclosed&rsquo; the contents of the Finlay interview of Ms. Ferens. They say, essentially, that the fact Ms. Ferens had no idea how many till tapes she received and could not testify to that fact is &lsquo;specifically noted&rsquo; or &lsquo;can be inferred&rsquo;. It is manifestly clear that Mr. Kendal created evidence which he attributed to Ms. Ferens, and suppressed her true evidence from the PPSC, the Crown, and the respondents. Mr. Kendal made no mention of the Finlay interview in his testimony during the criminal trial, and in the malicious prosecution trial, he continued his efforts to suppress this evidence. He testified in direct that in preparing the Prosecution Reports, he relied wholly on Ms. Ferens' statement to Glen Foster: A.R. p. 86, paras. 227 and 228 and made no reference to the Finlay interview, despite admitting in cross that he had reviewed Finlay's notes the week prior. The appellant does not challenge the finding of the trial judge that Mr. Kendal attempted to conceal the existence of the Finlay interview in his testimony before the trial judge: A.R. p. 92, paras. 252 and 253.</P>
<P>80. The appellant does not challenge the trial judge's finding that Mr. Kendal misled Lisa McLean by telling her the bookkeeper had yet to be interviewed on the issue of her only receiving two till tapes (which she had), and about whether she had refused to be interviewed by Mr. Kendal (she had not): A.R. p. 92, para. 250&ndash;252.</P>
<P>81. The appellant does not challenge the findings of the trial judge in respect to Mr. Kendal's credibility. Namely, that Mr. Kendal was argumentative, evasive, inflexible and reluctant to concede what clearly should have been conceded: A.R. p. 93, para. 258.</P>
<P>82. The appellant goes so far as to suggest: &ldquo;there is no evidence that Mr. Kendal suppressed key information and thereby misled the prosecutors&rdquo; (appellant's factum, p. 22, para. 70). With respect, this assertion is manifestly incorrect. The trial judge found that Mr. Kendal clearly withheld evidence from and misled PPSC, based on the following findings of fact which are not challenged by the appellant:
<P1>a. Mr. Kendal knew that Ms. Ferens' had told Mr. Finlay that she did not look at the till tapes and did not know and could not say how many till tapes she received from the respondents, nor what information it represented: A.R. p. 26, para. 24;</P1>
<P1>b. Despite that knowledge, Mr. Kendal wrote in the draft Prosecution Report that:
<QUOTE><P>interviews with the bookkeeper will show that she only received two till tapes per day from the Samaroos: A.R p. 28, para. 28;</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>c. And:
<QUOTE><P>Debbie Ferens has stated to the auditor that she only ever received two till tapes from the Samaroos to do the books of MGM (see witness report #1 for the auditor Glen Foster). Debbie Ferens will be contacted and interviewed to confirm this statement;</P></QUOTE>
<P2>A.R. p. 28, para. 29</P2></P1>
<P1>d. Mr. Kendal did not disclose the existence of the Finlay interview to Ms. McLean, even after he was directed to interview Ms. Ferens and confirm her evidence that she only received 2 daily till taps A.R. p. 64, para. 152;</P1>
<P1>e. Mr. Kendal misled Ms. McLean when he told her that Ms. Ferens' had refused to be interviewed. She had not refused, just requested that questions be put through her counsel, Mr. George Jones: A.R. p. 34, para. 54</P1>
<P1>f. Mr. Kendal prepared the final Prosecution Report and charges were &lsquo;approved&rsquo; on the theory that during 2004-2005 the Samaroos appropriated $1.7 million from their businesses by failing to report one of the three daily till tapes. He included these critical passages in the Prosecution Report in respect to Ms. Ferens, which also served as her will-say statement because no will-say was prepared:
<QUOTE><P>The bookkeeper Debbie Ferens...will be able to explain that she received a filled out preformatted &ldquo;Daily Cash Report&rdquo; summary sheet for each day of the month with till tape #1 sales data, till tape #2 sales data and a summary column of those two days till tapes, and this is attached with the till tapes for that month as provided to her by Tony Samaroo.</P>
<P>And:
<QUOTE><P>Element #4: The accused provided only two of the three daily till tapes to their bookkeeper Debbie Ferens to February 28, 2006.</P>
<P>- Debbie Ferens will be able to attest to having met the CRA auditor, Glen Foster on March 21st of 2006, and informed him that <UNDER>she has only ever received two MGM till tapes per day from Tony Samaroo for the period under audit</UNDER>. [Emphasis added.] A.R. p. 83, para. 216</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>g. Mr. Kendal chose not to prepare a will-say statement for Ms. Ferens nor did he disclose the notes of the Finlay interview in the witness statement binder disclosed to the respondents. Instead, he buried it in a large binder of search materials&mdash;one of 88 binders of disclosure&mdash;and made no reference to the notes in the index of the binder: (A.R. p. 64, para. 153).</P1>
<P1>h. In 2010, Mr. Kendal was directed to interview Ms. Ferens. He prepared 41 pages of typed questions before that interview which had the appearance of Mr. Kendal seeking to obtain from Ms. Ferens the evidence he wanted from her and had already wrongfully attributed to her: (A.R. p. 64, para. 154);</P1>
<P1>i. After typing up Ms. Ferens' will-say on February 9, 2010, Mr. Kendal interviewed Ms. Diane Ye for the third time, during which she mentioned for the first time the alleged existence of a &lsquo;second&rsquo; daily sales summary sheet. Then, Mr. Kendal went back and altered Ms. Ferens' will-say to include the corroborative statement that she only received one sheet from the respondents. Mr. Kendal did not disclose to the respondents either the 2010 interviews of Ms. Ferens or Ms. Ye, despite having been responsible for disclosure up until that point. A.R. p. 64, see discussion on disclosure issues</P1></P>
<P>83. As found by the trial judge:
<QUOTE><P>[62] Knowing that he had not carried out the investigatory steps requested by Ms. McLean, and knowing that Ms. Ferens could not provide evidence proving that only two till tapes from two shifts were reported, Mr. Kendal nonetheless proceeded and in doing so provided incomplete and erroneous information to those who would rely upon and act upon this Prosecution Report. They did so and the matter proceeded to charge approval.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 36, para. 62</P1></P>
<P>84. As the appellant states at p. 25, paras. 79 and 80 of their factum, the PPSC &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; depended on Mr. Kendal for the information upon which the prosecution was approved and proceeded. It was Mr. Kendal who, through his &lsquo;summary of available evidence&rsquo; in the form of his two Prosecution Reports, identified &lsquo;what evidence supports the charges&rsquo;. As Ms. McLean testified, and as the appellant points out, PPSC relied on Mr. Kendal for the information he provided in respect to Ms. Ferens in order to determine if charges would go forward. As found by the trial judge, and not challenged by the appellant, Mr. Kendal was clearly &lsquo;actively&rsquo; instrumental in the prosecution of the respondents. He caused everything to be done which could be done to wrongfully set the law in motion against the Samaroos. As found by the trial judge (A.R. p. 75, para. 198), CRA initiated the prosecution within the meaning of the tort of malicious prosecution, a finding not challenged by the appellant on this appeal.</P>
<P>85. The appellant makes reference to Brian Jones' and Janna Hyman's testimony at trial that they reviewed the Prosecution Report and held the view that the prosecution was &lsquo;justified&rsquo;. The trial judge weighed this evidence and importantly, found that neither Ms. Hyman or Mr. Jones ever prepared a written analysis of the case. Ms. Hyman had no record of ever having communicated her view to Mr. Jones and he testified that he had no discussions with Ms. Hyman about the legal reasoning behind the charges being laid: A.R. p. 38, para. 67.</P>
<P>86. Consider as well the trial judge's findings that Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones' testimony in respect to when charges were approved and their respective roles in the charge approval process was directly contrary to the evidence: A.R. p. 73, para. 186.</P>
<P>87. In respect to the roles that Ms. Hyman, Mr. Jones and Mr. Kendal played in the charge approval process, the trial judge correctly concluded as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[195] Instead, I find that the charges against the Samaroos were not approved until Mr. Kendal swore the Information in June 2008. This means that in the charge approval process, neither Ms. Hyman, nor Mr. Brian Jones, prepared any written analysis of the case nor did the two ever discuss the legal reasoning of the case. Instead, it appears they relied on Mr. Kendal and the CRA to gather the evidence, draft the final Information, and essentially, do charge approval. While Mr. Jones approved the charges proceeding, it appears the extent of his actual contribution to charge approval was determining whether to proceed summarily or by indictment.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 75, para. 195</P1></P>
<P>88. The appellants take issue with the trial judge's findings that Mr. Kendal was &lsquo;in effect responsible for the prosecution of the Respondent and not the Crown&rsquo;: appellant's factum, p. 24, para. 76. Curiously, the appellant has not challenged the trial judge's finding that the CRA initiated the prosecution within the meaning of the tort of malicious prosecution. As set out above, the evidence was clear that Mr. Kendal was &lsquo;actively&rsquo; instrumental in setting the law in motion and as a result the appellant &lsquo;initiated&rsquo; the prosecution within the meaning of the tort of malicious prosecution.</P>
<P>89. It is significant to note that the appellant ignores the trial judge's extensive discussion on charge approval: A.R., pp. 72&ndash;75, paras. 185&ndash;195 and his findings of fact in respect to the charge approval process: A.R. pp. 36&ndash;43, paras. 63&ndash;87. It is critical to understand that the trial judge expressly found that Ms. Hyman and Mr. Jones' testimony as to when charges were approved was in direct contradiction to the evidence: A.R. p. 73, para. 186. The trial judge found that neither Ms. Hyman or Mr. Jones ever discussed the legal reasoning of the case nor did they prepare any written analysis of the case: A.R. p. 75, para. 195. The extent of Mr. Jones' actual contribution to charge approval was in respect to determining whether to proceed summarily or by indictment: A.R. p. 75, para. 195. In that regard, he emailed Ms. Hyman on April 29, 2008 and indicated, in favour of proceeding by indictment, that: &ldquo;on the other hand, getting serious time on one of these prosecutions is a goal I have yet to achieve&rdquo;: A.R. p. 40, para. 72. Mr. Jones explained in his examination for discovery and at trial that he was referring to his previous inability to &ldquo;have a court&rdquo; impose the sentence suggested by PPSC: A.R. p. 41, para. 73.</P>
<P>90. Critically, the trial judge found that Ms. McLean's position, taken on behalf of PPSC and set out in her draft memorandum on charge approval, was agreed to by both Jana Hyman and Bruce Harper. The trial judge found:
<QUOTE><P>[49] Three senior lawyers in the PPSC were of the opinion that no charges should be approved until the above tasks were completed. In addition, the amounts the corporations were to be charged with were to be calculated on a specific basis.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 33, para. 49.</P1></P>
<P>91. The appellant's frame one of the trial judge's findings in respect to Mr. Kendal's state of mind as follows: &ldquo;The trial judge found that Mr. Kendal acted with an improper purpose as he hoped to convict the Respondents because he believed they were guilty...Thus, Punnett J. accepted that Mr. Kendal believed in the respondents' guilt and that his purpose was to bring them before a criminal court for trial&rdquo;: A.R. p. 27, para. 86. The appellant relies on the finding for the proposition that a subjective belief in guilt will insulate a person from a malicious prosecution.</P>
<P>92. With respect, the appellant has materially misstated the trial judge's finding. The finding referred to is para. 257 of the trial judge's reasons, which provides as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[257] Proof of malice requires proof on a balance of probabilities that in the role of an investigator, Mr. Kendal acted deliberately to subvert and abuse his office. I find that he did so. He did so by supressing evidence and attributing evidence to witnesses that was not accurate. He had decided from the beginning of his involvement with the Samaroos that they were guilty and set out to prove that was the case even if to do so required a breach of his proper role and responsibilities. He knowingly misstated evidence essential to the proof of the <EM>actus reus</EM> despite being aware of its importance, filed a misleading report knowing it would be relied upon to authorize the prosecution and then having achieved that end swore the Information all in the hope of convicting the plaintiffs. His purpose was improper. I am satisfied that malice has been vicariously established as against the CRA as a result of the conduct of Mr. Kendal.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 93.</P1></P>
<P>93. And, the trial judge continued at para. 258 as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[258] As a witness, I found Mr. Kendal to be argumentative, evasive, inflexible and reluctant to concede what clearly should have been conceded. He wrote the Prosecution Report as an advocate not an investigator. He presented the evidence in a way designed to mislead both the PPSC and Mr. Brian Jones. His clear intent was to see that criminal charges were laid. The presumption of innocence appeared to be meaningless to him. The manner in which he approached the evidence was not objective. He had his theory and he then sought to prove it.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>A.R. p. 93</P1></P>
<P>94. It is clear that the trial judge did not accept that Mr. Kendal held a <EM>bona fide</EM>, honest belief in the guilt of the respondents. The Court in <EM>Miazga</EM> found that proof of malice requires that the respondent prove that the defendant was acting pursuant to an improper purpose inconsistent with his role: at para. 79. The trial judge applied the correct test and found that Mr. Kendal deliberately subverted and abused his role as an investigator with the appellant. Mr. Kendal never held an <EM>honest</EM>, albeit mistaken <UNDER>professional</UNDER> belief that reasonable and probable cause did in fact exist: see <EM>Miazga</EM> at para. 79 (underlining added).</P>
<P>95. With respect to the references to the culture within CRA, the trial judge's comments were obiter, and did not form the basis of his findings in respect to Mr. Kendal. However there was ample evidence upon which the trial judge could conclude was indicative of a unfortunate culture within CRA, most notably the conduct of Mr. Kendal and Mr. Alan Jones.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
