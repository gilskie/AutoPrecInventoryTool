<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT <EM>1526818 Ontario Inc BN:8539874444RC0001, Younan Mikhail</EM> [#omitted]<EM>and Hellen Mikhail</EM> [#omitted]appeals to the Court from assessment of taxation years ending October 31, 2010 to 2013 and taxation years 2010 and 2011 for Younan Mikhail and taxation years 2012 and 2013 for Hellen Mikhail.
<P1>A. Reasons for the appeal. The company was assessed for incentives received in the above years that were not declared as income. In addition however the employees that received the incentives were also assessed for the same amounts resulting in double taxation. In addition on further review with the employees, the amounts indicated are not correct. In particular the large amounts in 2010 were not received. They only remember receiving amounts under $1,000.</P1></P>
<P>B. Statement of relevant facts in support of the appeal. In the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Chopp v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>, Mojan J. stated the following: If a shareholder is also an employee of the corporation and receives a benefit in his capacity as employee. the value of that benefit would be taxed under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the act. A corporation is ordinarily permitted to deduct as a business expense the cost of a benefit received or enjoyed by an employee.</P>
<P>I ELECT to have the informal procedure provided by sections 18.1 to 18.28 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM> apply to this appeal.</P>

<P2>r. the Shareholders appropriated the Rebates referred to in the previous subparagraph as follows (the &ldquo;Appropriated Rebates&rdquo;):
<P3>i. Younan appropriated $9,812 and $1,882 of the Rebates in the 2010 and 2011 calendar years, respectively; and</P3>
<P3>ii. Helen appropriated $9,952 and $2,525 of the Rebates in the 2012 and 2013 calendar years, respectively.</P3></P2>

<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P><P1>9. Whether the Minister properly included Unreported Rebates and Incentives of $9,952 and $2,525 in the 2012 and 2013 taxation years, respectively.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>10. The Attorney General relies on subsections 3, 15(1), 152(9), and 246(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985. c.1 (5th Supp.) as amended (&ldquo;<EM>Ac</EM>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>11. Whereas Queenslake Pharmacy failed to report all of the Rebates it earned in the course of doing business with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, and whereas some of those Rebates were appropriated by the Appellant in her capacity as a shareholder, therefore the Minister has properly reassessed the Appellant to include the Appropriated Rebates as the Appellant's income for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>12. In the alternative, Queenslake Pharmacy conferred a benefit on the Appellant in the form of the Appropriated Rebates. The Rebates are therefore part of her income by operation of subsection 246(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>13. The Attorney General requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P1></P>

<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT, <EM>Younan Mikhail SIN</EM>[#omitted]appeals to the Court from assessment of taxation years 2010 and 2011. Notice of Confirmation for which was dated Jan 25, 2018. See attached.
<P1>A. Reasons for the appeal.&mdash;The company was assessed for incentives received in the above years that were not declared as income. In addition however the employees that received the incentives were also assessed for the same amounts resulting in double taxation. When CRA brought it to our attention that the incentives might be not have been reported properly, it offered an opportunity to correct our tax returns without penalties, only arrears interest will apply. Double taxation in a punitive measure.
<P2>In addition on further review with the employee, the amounts indicated are not correct. In particular the payments of $6,078.01 and $3,734,64 in 2010 were not received. The amount received was $1136.71 only in 2011. See attached.</P2></P1>
<P1>B. Statement of relevant facts in support of the appeal.&mdash;In the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Chopp v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>, Mojan J. stated the following: If a shareholder is also an employee of the corporation and receives a benefit in his capacity as employee, the value of that benefit would be tasted under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the act. A corporation is ordinarily permitted to deduct as a business expense the cost of a benefit received or enjoyed by an employee. A corporation, however, is not permitted to deduct any amount with respect to a benefit conferred on a shareholder qua shareholder because the corporate/shareholder relationship is not incidental to the corporation's business.
<P2>Both individuals (Younan and Hellen Mikhail SIN[#omitted]) that received incentives were employees of the company.</P2></P1></P>
<P>I ELECT to have the informal procedure provided by sections 18.1 to 18.28 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM> apply to this appeal.</P>

<P2>r. the Shareholders appropriated the Rebates referred to in the previous subparagraph as follows (the &ldquo;Appropriated Rebates&rdquo;):
<P3>i. Younan appropriated $9,812 and $1,882 of the Rebates in the 2010 and 2011 calendar years, respectively;</P3>
<P3>ii. Helen appropriated $9,952 and $2,525 of the Rebates in the 2012 and 2013 calendar years, respectively;</P3></P2>
<P2>s. No employees of Queenslake Pharmacy other than the Appellant and Hellen received a benefit in the form of the Appropriated Rebates.</P2>
<P2>t. In determining that the Appellant made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness, or wilful default, in filing his income tax returns for the 2010 and 2011 taxation years, the Minister relied on the facts set out in the previous paragraphs, together with the following facts:
<P3>i. Queenslake Pharmacy reported as income all Rebates paid by cheques issued to the Appellant;</P3>
<P3>iii. a material portion of the Rebates were selected to be paid by methods other than a cheque;</P3>
<P3>iv. the Rebates not paid by cheque were not reported as income by the Queenslake Pharmacy;</P3>
<P3>v. the Appellant is aware of the Rebates;</P3>
<P3>vi. the Appellant was involved in choosing the method of payment of the Rebates;</P3>
<P3>vii. the Appropriated Rebates were used for the Shareholders' personal use;</P3>
<P3>viii. there is no relationship between the Shareholders and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers outside of the business relationship surrounding the Appellant;</P3>
<P3>ix. rebates in the pharmaceutical industry are very common and have consistently been treated as taxable income;</P3>
<P3>x. the Shareholders began the pharmacy business in 2002 and were well aware of the appropriate treatment of the Rebates;</P3>
<P3>xi. the Shareholders did not keep proper records of the Rebates received;</P3>
<P3>xii. the Shareholders did not include these benefits in the calculation of their personal income reported for tax; and</P3>
<P3>xiii. the amount of Rebates which the Appellant failed to report were substantial compared to the total amount of income he reported in the 2010 and 2011 taxation years.</P3></P2></P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P><P1>9. The issues to be decided are whether:
<P2>a. the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant's income tax returns for the 2010 and 2011 taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period; and</P2>
<P2>b. the Minister properly included Unreported Rebates and Incentives of $9.812 and $1,882 in the 2010 and 2011 taxation years, respectively.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>10. The Attorney General relies on sections subsections 3, 15(1), 152(4), 152(9) and 246(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985. c.1 (5th Supp.) as amended (&ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>11. Whereas Queenslake Pharmacy failed to report all of the Rebates it earned in the course of doing business with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, and whereas some of those Rebates were appropriated by the Appellant in his capacity as a shareholder, therefore the Minister has properly reassessed the Appellant to include the Appropriated Rebates as the Appellant's income for the 2010 and 2011 taxation years pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>12. In the alternative, Queenslake Pharmacy conferred a benefit on the Appellant in the form of the Appropriated Rebates. The Rebates are therefore part of his income by operation of subsection 246(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>13. Subsection 152(4) of the Act authorizes reassessment at any time where a taxpayer has made any misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Appellant made such misrepresentation, therefore the Minister was not out of time to reassess his 2010 and 2011 taxation years.</P1>
<P1>14. The Attorney General requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P1></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>NOTICE OF APPEAL</UNDER></TI>
<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT <EM>1526818 Ontario Inc BN: 8539874444RC0001</EM> appeals to the Court from assessments of taxation years ending October 31, 2010 to 2013. Notice of Confirmation for which was dated Nov 6, 2017. See attached letter re Application for Extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal.
<P1>A. Reasons for the appeal.&mdash;The company was assessed for incentives received in the above years that were not declared as income. In addition however the employees that received the incentives were also assessed for the same amounts resulting in double taxation. When CRA brought it to our attention that the incentives might be not have been reported properly, it offered an opportunity to correct our tax returns without penalties, only arrears interest will apply. Double taxation in a punitive measure.
<P2>In addition on further review with the employees, the amounts indicated are not correct. In particular the payments of $6,078.01 and $3,734.64 in 2010 were not received. The amount received was $1136.71 only in 2011. They only remember receiving amounts under $1,000. The amount received in 2012 was $6,415 and in 2013 $3,737.93. See attached.</P2></P1>
<P1>B. Statement of relevant facts in support of the appeal.&mdash;In the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Chopp v. The Queen</SOC></CASEREF>, Mojan J. stated the following: If a shareholder is also an employee of the corporation and receives a benefit in his capacity as employee, the value of that benefit would be taxed under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the act. A corporation is ordinarily permitted to deduct as a business expense the cost of a benefit received or enjoyed by an employee. A corporation, however, is not permitted to deduct any amount with respect to a benefit conferred on a shareholder qua shareholder because the corporate/shareholder relationship is not incidental to the corporation's business.
<P2>Both individuals (Younan Mikhail SIN [#omitted]and Hellen Mikhail SIN [#omitted]that received incentives were employees of the company.</P2></P1></P>
<P>I ELECT to have the informal procedure provided by sections 18.1 to 18.28 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM> apply to this appeal.</P>

<P><P1>15. The Attorney General relies on section 3, subsections 9 (1), 12(1), 56(2), 152(4), 152(9) and paragraph 12(1)(x), of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th Supp.) as amended (&ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>16. The appeal for the taxation year ended October 31, 2013 ought to be quashed on the basis that the Minister has reassessed $nil tax, interest and penalties. Therefore, no rights of appeal in respect thereof.</P1>
<P1>17. The Attorney General submits that as the Appellant failed to report all of the Rebates it earned in the course of doing business with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, the Minister has properly reassessed the Appellant to include the unreported Rebates in its income pursuant to sections 3, 9 and 12 of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>18. In the alternative, to the extent any of the Rebates were paid directly to the Shareholders, they are benefits conferred on the Shareholders at the Appellant's direction and must be included in the Appellant's income pursuant to subsection 56(2) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>19. Subsection 152(4) of the <EM>Act</EM> authorizes reassessment at any time where a taxpayer has made any misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Appellant made such misrepresentation, therefore the Minister was not out of time to reassess its taxation years ended October 31, 2010, October 31, 2011, October 31, 2012 and October 31, 2013.</P1>
<P1>20. The Attorney General requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P1></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>
