<P>48. After The Hive discovered that it erroneously included the reimbursements as consultant fees, it submitted revised T4A slips to the Minister to reflect that the above amounts were reimbursements and not consultant fees.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(d)</N><TI><UNDER>ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>49. The issues to be determined are:
<P1>a. whether the Minister properly included $8,125 related to Sloans Curve as unreported income in the Appellant's 2007 taxation year pursuant to ss. 9(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, as amended (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>b. whether the Minister properly included $40,867 related to Moongate as unreported income in the Appellant's 2008 taxation year pursuant to ss. 9(1) of the Act;</P1>
<P1>c. whether the Minister properly included $43,816 reimbursed to Mandrake Properties as unreported income in the Appellant's 2008 taxation year pursuant to ss. 9(1) of the Act; and</P1>
<P1>d. whether the Minister properly included $83,619 related to Sloans Curve as unreported income in the Appellant's 2008 taxation year pursuant to ss. 9(1) of the Act.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(e)</N><TI><UNDER>STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELIED UPON</UNDER></TI>
<P>50. The Appellant relies, <EM>inter alia</EM>, upon and 9(1) of the Act.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(f)</N><TI><UNDER>REASONS</UNDER></TI>
<P>51. The Appellant submits that the Minister failed to properly consider that the $8,125 payment from The Hive to Ms. Peerenboom in relation to Sloans Curve in 2007 was a reimbursement of occupancy costs and not income to the Appellant. Furthermore, even if the amount was income, which is not admitted, it should be included in Ms. Peerenboom's income and not in the Appellant's income.</P>
<P>52. The Appellant submits that the Minister failed to properly consider that the $40,867 payment in relation to Moongate in 2008 was a reimbursement to Mandrake Properties for the renovations to Moongate requested by The Hive and not income to the Appellant.</P>
<P>53. The Appellant submits that the Minister failed to properly consider that the $43,816 in relation to travel expenses and Sloan Curve's expenses in 2008 were reimbursements to Mandrake Properties and not income to the Appellant.</P>
<P>54. The Appellant submits that the Minister failed to properly consider that $83,619 in relation to travel expenses and Sloan Curve's expenses in 2008 were reimbursements to Mandrake Properties and not income to the Appellant.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(g)</N><TI><UNDER>RELIEF SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. The Appellant requests that his appeal be allowed, with costs, and that the matter be referred back to the Minister for reassessment on the basis that the Minister has erred reassessing the Appellant's 2007 and 2008 taxation years to include $8,125 and $168,630, respectively, as unreported income.</P>
<P>56. The Appellant requests such further or other relief as this Honorable Court deems just.</P>

<P>In reply to the Appellant's Notice of Appeal with respect to the 2007 and 2008 taxation years, the Deputy Attorney General of Canada says:</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. He admits the allegations of fact stated in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, 18, 37, 42 and 45 of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>2. He denies the allegations of fact stated in paragraph 44 of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>3. He has no knowledge of and therefore puts in issue the allegations of fact stated in paragraphs 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 to 36, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 48 of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>4. With respect to paragraph 4 of the Notice of Appeal, he admits the allegations of fact in the first sentence but has no knowledge of and puts in issue the remaining allegations of fact in this paragraph.</P>
<P>5. He denies paragraph 43 and states that the Minister audited The Hive and found that the <EM>payments</EM> to the Appellant, Mandrake Properties and Ms. Peerenboom were recorded as payments to a consultant.</P>
<P>6. He denies paragraph 46 and states that on May 28, 2010, the Minister issued Notices of Reassessement for the Appellant's 2007 and 2008 taxation years to include the <EM>payments</EM> in the Appellant's income.</P>
<P>7. He denies paragraph 47 and states that the <EM>payments</EM> from the Hive and added to the Appellant's income include the amounts set out in this paragraph.</P>
<P>8. The Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) reassessed the Appellant's tax liability for the 2007 and 2008 years by Notices dated May 28, 2010 to include T4A income from The Hive Strategic Marketing Inc. (the &ldquo;Hive&rdquo;) of $176,755 and $168,302, respectively.</P>
<P>9. The Appellant filed a Notice of Objection on August 12, 2010.</P>
<P>10. By Notice dated October 14, 2015, the Minister varied the reassessment for the 2007 taxation year to remove $168,630 of income and the Minister confirmed the reassessment for the 2008 taxation year.</P>
<P>11. In determining the Appellant's tax liability, the Minister made the following assumptions of fact:
<P1>a) the Appellant provided consulting services to the Hive in the 2007 and 2008 taxation years;</P1>
<P1>b) the Appellant and the Hive arranged so that the Hive would pay for the Appellant's expenses and make upgrades to his Moongate (Ontario) property and his Sloans Curve (Florida) property in exchange for the Appellant's consulting services;</P1>
<P1>c) the Appellant received income from the Hive of $8,125 in the 2007 taxation year; and</P1>
<P1>d) the Appellant received income from the Hive of $168,302 in the 2008 taxation year.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P>12. The issues are:
<P1>a) Whether the Minister properly included $8,125 in the Appellant's income in the 2007 taxation year under section 9(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>b) Whether the Minister properly included $168,302 in the Appellant's income in the 2008 taxation year under section 9(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELIED ON</TI>
<P>13. He relies on sections 3, 9, 18, 20, 152, 153 of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;) and Regulation 200 of the <EM>Income Tax Regulations</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>D.</N><TI>GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P>14. He respectfully submits that the Minister properly included $8,125 and $168,302 in the Appellant's income in the 2007 and 2008 taxation years, respectively, under section 9(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>He requests that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</P>
