<BLOCK0><TI>NOTICE OF APPEAL WITH ELECTION LIMITING AMOUNTS IN ISSUE (INFORMAL PROCEDURE)</TI>
<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>NOTICE OF APPEAL, ELECTION AND WAIVER</UNDER></TI>
<P>TAKE NOTICE THAT MAC &amp; MAC HYDRODEMOLITION SERVICES INC. appeals to the Court from Notices of Reassessment for taxation years ending July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2013, Exhibits A and B, respectively, including CRA's Explanation of Changes for both taxation years, Exhibits C and D, respectively, copies of which are included herein.</P>
<P><QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Reasons for the appeal.</TI>
<P>Erroneous arguments made by CRA in their letter dated September 22, 2015 (copy included herein as Exhibit E) which is summarized on page 5 of 6 as follows:</P>
<P>In summary, the taxpayer worked to develop a process for selectively removing a polyurethane lining from a length of pipe, with the possibility of also removing an underlying rubber layer. The taxpayer had no experience with removing these materials and so the work involved determining the values of parameters (factors) which would achieve this result. The taxpayer is experienced in hydrodemolition and knowledgeable in the effects of these factors. There is no change in the eligibility determination for this project.</P>
<P>CRA also makes the following erroneous opinions on the three basic scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED) eligibility criteria, as defined in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act, as follows:</P>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Technological Uncertainty (page 4 of 6, part 2c of Exhibit E):</TI>
<P>Applying hydrodemolition methods to a different material is not a technological uncertainty. It raises the question of whether hydrodemolition is appropriate for removing this material, but this question can be resolved by using existing hydrodemolition equipment on the material.</P>
<P>The CRA accepts that the factors required to remove only the polyurethane layer were unknown to the taxpayer at the time of starting the work. The company has significant experience in hydrodemolition, and therefore has knowledge of the various factors under their control and the relationship between these factors and their impact on the removal process. The limited information available describing the work does not clearly show that the claimant followed a systematic investigation.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>Systematic Investigation (page 5 of 6, part 4 of Exhibit E)</TI>
<P>The representation states that the RTA erred in describing the work as &ldquo;trial and error&rdquo;. This description was based on a lack of documented test results and a review of &ldquo;Vern's Notes&rdquo; for 2012 and 2013 which repeatedly refers to the different things they tried. The representation claims the taxpayer identified the significant factors, completed a test matrix and refined their design based on their analysis of the test results.</P>
<P>The CRA re-examined the documentation and the discussions which took place at the site visit. The documentation is too vague to draw any particular conclusions, as the entries in &ldquo;Vern's Notes&rdquo; are typically one brief sentence for each week. At the site visit, the RTA requested evidence of any analysis, but none was provided.&rdquo;</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3.</N><TI>Technological Advancement (page 5 of 6, part 5 of Exhibit E)</TI>
<P>However, the definition of experimental development states that it is work undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement, for the purpose of creating new or improved materials, devices, products or processes. The objective of experimental development is to achieve technological advancement which is embodied in a new or improved material, device product or process. The attempt to achieve technological advancement has not been established.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>Statement of relevant facts in support of the appeal.</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>1.</N><TI>Technological Uncertainty</TI>
<P>The CRA accepts that &ldquo;the factors required to remove only the polyurethane layer were unknown to the taxpayer at the time of starting the work.&rdquo; They then make the unreasonable assumption that &ldquo;The company has significant experience in hydrodemolition, and therefore has knowledge of the various factors under thei r control and the relationship between these factors and their impact on the removal process&rdquo;.</P>
<P>Mac &amp; Mac provided evidence that many design variables were tested in both fiscal periods, including water pressure, flow rate, travel speed, stand-off distance between the high-pressure nozzle and the inside surface of the pipe, and various commercially available nozzles. Mac &amp; Mac also provided evidence (Canadian patent -pending applications CA2812334A1 and CA2812558A1) that the development involved the non -trivial combination of standard factors, and therefore involved an inventive step. In a recent Tax Court ruling, 1726437 Ontario Inc o/a Airmax Technologies, 2012 TCC 376 [Airmax], Justice Hogan found that &ldquo;Airmax's technological uncertainty could not be removed by routine engineering because it involved the non-trivial combination of standard technologies&rdquo;. In other words, the R&amp;D could not be solved by routine engineering because the solution required an inventive step. Mac &amp; Mac's solution also included an inventive step. Evidence of said inventive step includes recent correspondence from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) dated April 11, 2017, wherein the Canadian patent office accepts that Mac &amp; Mac's invention embodied in CA2812334A1 contains allowable subject matter (Exhibit F, page 2 of 5). Further, Mac &amp; Mac's attorney confirms in a March 21, 201 letter that the same invention was also allowed by the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office (Exhibit G).</P>
<P>Further, in another Tax Court Ruling, <CASEREF><SOC>Les Abeilles Service de Conditionnement Inc. c. La reine</SOC><CITE>2014 TCC CCI 313</CITE></CASEREF> [Abeilles], Justice Jorre stated (in paragraph 154) that the criteria of technological uncertainty can be met by the taxpayer not knowing how to achieve some goal that is very specific to its situation. This clearly applies here; Mac &amp; Mac did NOT know how to achieve its goal and conducted systematic testing of numerous factors over two fiscal periods before achieving new innovative processes protected by 1 issued patent (in the United States) and 1 pending patent application. Products that derive from standard engineering practice are not awarded patents because they do not satisfy the non-obviousness or inventive step requirement. Therefore, Mac &amp; Mac's inventive process is not based on standard practice and overcame technological uncertainty.</P>
<P>Paragraphs 155 and 177 of the Abeilles judgement also established that a diligent search that shows a lack of information in the public domain with respect to how to achieve the outcome sought in the project, is adequate evidence of &ldquo;technical uncertainty&rdquo;. The applicant and the patent offices in Canada and the United States both conducted searches, and both concur that there is no prior art in the public domain showing how to achieve the project's objectives.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>2.</N><TI>Systematic Investigation:</TI>
<P>The CRA stated that the client's documentation &ldquo;was too vague&rdquo; and did not include &ldquo;evidence of any analysis&rdquo;. This statement is false. Numerous scanned copies of logbook analyses were provided. A detailed spreadsheet for each fiscal period was provided showing which test factors were being investigated on a weekly basis. Analysis and conclusions were also included. Paragraph 157 of the Abeilles judgement established that contemporaneous documentation does not have to have special content related to SR&amp;ED. Rather, the documentation only needs to prove that the work was done and when it was done. Mac &amp; Mac's documentation meets this test. Further, paragraph 158 of the Abeilles judgement established that adjustments to a manufacturing process can constitute a systematic investigation.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3.</N><TI>Technological Advancement:</TI>
<P>The CRA wrote &ldquo;The objective of experimental development is to achieve technological advancement which is embodied in a new or improved material, device product or process.&rdquo; Clearly, Mac &amp; Mac achieved a new device product. As already described, there was no standard practice for applying hydro-demolition techniques to the inside of a large pipe with a polyurethane or rubber liner. Further, there were no known techniques that could selectively remove a polyurethane layer approximately 1 inch thick while leaving the underlying rubber layer relatively intact. Mac &amp; Mac faced technological uncertainties (design of the novel nozzle system inside the pipe, and the determination of significant variables and appropriate experimental conditions in order to selectively remove only part of the liner), and undertook experimental development work to resolve them. Mac &amp; Mac's novel and challenging objective was to advance the state of hydro-demolition by developing a new process to 1) uniformly remove polymeric and rubber liner material from the inside of a pipe without damaging the inside wall, and 2) selectively remove the polyurethane layer from the inside of the pipe while leaving the rubber layer intact. They achieved this new process and they are the only company in the world that has such technology. It makes no sense to argue that a new or improved device or process was not developed.</P>
<P>Further, Paragraph 162 of the Abeilles judgement establishes that technological progress in the engineering process, in terms of speed or flexibility, equates to a technological advancement. Mac &amp; Mac's new process is more flexible and superior to known or standard hydrodemolition processes that completely disintegrate hard refractory material such as concrete. In their specific project, the material is a so ft liner that is adhered to the inside of a metal pipe used for transporting crude oil or bitumen. The liner is comprised of a layer of rubber compound about 0.25 inches thick, followed by a polyurethane layer about 1 inch thick that is adhered to the rubb er layer. At the time of the project, there was no information or data available on applying hydro -demolition techniques to the inside of a large pipe with a polymeric or rubber liner, or combinations thereof. Further, there were no known techniques that could selectively remove a polyurethane layer approximately 1 inch thick while leaving the underlying rubber layer relatively intact.</P>
<P>Mac &amp; Mac's achievement should be celebrated and rewarded, not minimized as being trivial or routine engineering.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P>

<P1>3. On or about February 17, 2016, the Appellant served Notices of Objection to the Income Tax Reassessments dated November 19, 2015 and November 23, 2015.</P1>
<P1>4. The Appellant filed an appeal prior to the minister rendering his decision.</P1>
<P1>5. In determining the Appellant's SR&amp;ED ITCs for its taxation years ending July 31, 2012 and 2013, the Minister relied on the following assumptions of fact:
<P2>a. the Appellant is a privately owned Canadian corporation, incorporated on February 13, 1989;</P2>
<P2>b. the Appellant provides a variety of industrial pressure washing and demolition services using high-velocity water propelled through a nozzle by high pressure (up to 40,000 PSI);</P2>
<P2>c. the Appellant's taxation year-end is July 31;</P2>
<P2>d. the Appellant elected to use the proxy method pursuant to subsection 37(8)a)(ii)(B) of the Act for the calculation of SR&amp;ED expenditures and related investment tax credits;</P2>
<P2>e. the Appellant's SR&amp;ED claims for its 2012 and 2013 taxation years were in respect of a project entitled &ldquo;Crude Oil Sands Pipe Interior Lining Removal System&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;);</P2>
<P2>f. for the 2012 taxation year, the objective of the Project was originally to remove a refractory lining, composed of an urethane layer and a rubber layer, from the interior of a pipe previously used to transport crude oil sands;</P2>
<P2>g. for the 2013 taxation year, the objective of the Project was to remove the urethane layer only while leaving the rubber layer intact;</P2>
<P2>h. the Appellant carried out the claimed activities through a trial and error process where standard hydro demolition design parameters were tested;</P2>
<P2>i. the Appellant did not formulate any scientific or technological hypothesis in relation to the unsatisfactory results of the trials;</P2>
<P2>j. the Appellant did not attempt to advance the underlying science or technology of hydro demolition;</P2>
<P2>k. the claimed work performed by the Appellant was:
<P3>i. routine engineering work;</P3>
<P3>ii. accomplished without encountering any technological uncertainty;</P3>
<P3>iii. not substantiated by adequate records maintained by the Appellant.</P3></P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>B.</N><TI>ISSUES TO BE DECIDED</TI>
<P><P1>6. Whether the Minister correctly determined that the Appellant did not incur current SR&amp;ED expenditures in the amounts of $365,255 and $352,500 for its 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively, thereby disallowing the Appellant's claimed SR&amp;ED ITCs in the amounts of $103,827 and $100,723 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively?</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>C.</N><TI>STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT</TI>
<P><P1>7. The AGC relies on section 127.1, subsections 37(1), 127(5), 127(9), 127(10.1), 127(10.2), 230(1) and 248(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985 c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.), as amended (hereinafter, the &ldquo;<BOLD>Act</BOLD>&rdquo;), as well as on sections 2900 and 2902 of the <EM>Income Tax Regulations</EM>, C.R.C., c. 945, as amended.</P1>
<P1>8. The AGC submits that the work performed by the Appellant in respect of the Project does not qualify as SR&amp;ED activities, pursuant to subsection 248(1) of the Act for the following reasons:
<P2>a) the Appellant did not encounter any scientific or technological uncertainty that could not be removed by standard practice;</P2>
<P2>b) the Appellant did not formulate any hypothesis aimed at reducing or eliminating a scientific or technological uncertainty;</P2>
<P2>c) the claimed work did not aim to achieve a scientific or a technological advancement;</P2></P1>
<P1>9. The AGC submits that the current SR&amp;ED expenditures in the amounts of $365,255 and $352,500 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively, were not incurred in respect of SR&amp;ED work carried on by the Appellant, pursuant to subsection 37(1) of the Act.</P1>
<P1>10. Accordingly, the AGC submits that the Appellant was not entitled to SR&amp;ED ITCs in the amounts of $103,827 and $100,723 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively, pursuant to subsections 127(5), 127(9) and 127(10.1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>11. Finally, he submits that the appellant has elected to have its appeal governed by sections 18.1 to 18.28 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, as amended. Consequently, he submits that, in accordance with section 18.1 of the <EM>Tax Court of Canada Act</EM>, the aggregate of all amounts in issue cannot be reduced by more than $25,000, regardless of the outcome of the appeal.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>WHEREFORE</BOLD> the Attorney General of Canada requests that the appeal be dismissed.</P>
