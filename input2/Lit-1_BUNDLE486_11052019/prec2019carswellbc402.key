<BLOCK1><TI>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE OF THE DEFENDANT <UNDER>LENGARA VENTURES INC. (the &ldquo;Defendant&rdquo;)</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Defendant denies each and every allegation in the Statement of Claim unless expressly admitted herein. For reference purposes only, the Defendant adopts the defined terms as set out in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>2. The Defendant admits the allegations of fact contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 10 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>3. In answer to paragraph 4, the Defendant admits that the Plaintiff and the Defendant executed a contract in writing dated March 12, 2009, which was drafted by the Plaintiff (the &ldquo;Original Contract&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. In further answer to paragraph 4, pursuant to the Contract, the Plaintiff agreed to provide more than project management services to the Improvement. The services to be provided by the Plaintiff to the Defendant included provision of labour, materials, and other services to the Improvement by the Plaintiff and by the sub-contractors to the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>5. The terms of the Original Contract in respect of services to be provided by the Plaintiff to the Improvement, were from time to time amended by further agreements between the Plaintiff and the Defendant made between March 12, 2009 and December 26, 2009 (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. Among the changes to the Original Contract after March 12, 2009, the fees for labour to be provided by the Plaintiff to the construction of the Improvement were reduced from the amounts provided by the Original Contract.</P>
<P>7. On December 26, 2009, the Plaintiff and the Defendant agreed, among other matters, as a term of the Contract, that the Plaintiff was required to provide a statutory declaration to the Defendant in respect of the invoices issued by the Plaintiff to the Defendant upon substantial completion of the Improvement, prior to payment of those invoices by the Defendant.</P>
<P>8. On December 26, 2009, the Plaintiff agreed with the Defendant that, except for circumstances beyond the Plaintiffs control, the Improvement was to be substantially completed by January 25, 2010, such that the building on the Lands was then to be completed and ready for occupancy.</P>
<P>9. It was an express, or alternatively an implied term of the Contract, that the Statutory Declaration to be provided by the Defendant was to be provided prior to payment of the invoices issued by the Plaintiff for services to the Improvement upon substantial completion, such that the Defendant was to have received assurances that all accounts for services to the Improvement incurred by the Plaintiff, for which the Defendant might in any way be held responsible, had been paid in full.</P>
<P>10. On or about January 15, 2010, the Defendant paid all amounts then due to the Plaintiff pursuant to the Contract for services to the Improvement (the &ldquo;Progress Payment&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. After the Progess Payment of January 15, 2010, the Plaintiff issued three further invoices for services provided by the Plaintiff to the Improvement, pursuant to the Contract. The invoices were dated February 2, 2010, March 9, 2010, and March 9, 2010, respectively. The total of the amounts invoiced by the Plaintiff to the Defendant pursuant to the three invoices was the sum of $104,648.91 (collectively the &ldquo;Invoices&rdquo;).</P>
<P>12. At all relevant times, the principal of the Plaintiff and the operating mind behind the operations of the Plaintiff was Alfredo Hermano.</P>
<P>13. A temporary Occupancy Permit was issued by the City of Vancouver in respect of the building on the Lands on March 1, 2010.</P>
<P>14. In accordance with the terms of the Contract, Alfredo Hermano duly executed a statutory declaration dated the 24<SUP>th</SUP>of February, 2010, which was subsequently provided to the Defendant in accordance with the terms of the Contract in conjunction with a request for payment of the three Invoices totaling $104,648.91.</P>
<P>15. The statutory declaration deposed by Alfredo Hermano contained, inter alia, the following declaration:
<QUOTE><P><EM>that all accounts for labour, subcontracts, products, services, and construction machinery and equipment which have been incurred directly by the Contractor in the performance of the work as required by the Contract, and for which the Owner might in any way be held responsible, have been paid in full as required by the Contract up to and including the latest progress payment received, as identified above, except for</EM>:
<P1><EM>1) holdback monies properly retained</EM>,</P1>
<P1><EM>2) payments deferred by agreement, or</EM></P1>
<P1><EM>3) amounts withheld by reason of legitimate dispute which have been identified to the party or parties, from whom payment has been withheld</EM>.</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>(the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo;)</P1></P>
<P>16. The Declaration was false. On the date the Declaration was made and when it was provided to the Defendant there were, to the knowledge of the Plaintiff and of Alfredo Hermano, four subcontractors to the Plaintiff who had issued invoices to the Plaintiff for services to the Improvement prior to the latest Progress Payment, which invoices were not then paid, and for which the Defendant could be held responsible. The unpaid amounts to these subcontractors then totaled approximately $75,000.00 (the &ldquo;Unpaid SubContracts).</P>
<P>17. The said Alfredo Hermano knew that the Declaration was false when it was made by him and when he provided it to the Defendant in conjunction with the request for payment. The false Declaration was made and was provided in order to mislead the Defendant in order to induce it to pay the Invoices notwithstanding the fact that there were then the significant Unpaid Sub-Contracts.</P>
<P>18. After the request was made for payment of the Invoices, and the Declaration was provided to the Defendant in support of the request, the Defendant did not pay the Invoices because it had then become aware of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts.</P>
<P>19. Upon becoming aware of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts the Defendant advised the Plaintiff that it was prepared to pay all amounts then properly due pursuant to the Contract subject to satisfactory arrangements for payment of the Unpaid Sub- Contracts. Notwithstanding this, the Plaintiff and its principal, Alfredo Hermano, refused to make arrangements to pay the Unpaid Sub-Contracts and caused the claim of lien which is the subject of these proceedings to be filed against the Lands thereby claiming the amount of $399,417.36 (the &ldquo;Claim of Lien&rdquo;).</P>
<P>20. The Claim of Lien was, to the knowledge of the Plaintiff and the said Alfredo Hermano, false.</P>
<P>21. Prior to the filing of the Lien the Plaintiff had issued invoices under the Contract for services which had already been paid for by the Defendant or for items which were not properly chargeable to the Defendant pursuant to the Contract (the &ldquo;Duplication&rdquo;). The Duplication was in the total sum of $18,131.50. The Duplication on the prior invoices issued by the Plaintiff was discovered by the Defendant in or about January of 2010, and an accounting of the Duplication was provided to the Plaintiff, who has refused or neglected to respond to the same.</P>
<P>22. In further answer to paragraphs 5 and 6:
<P1>a) The Plaintiff invoiced the Defendant pursuant to the Contract for services to the Improvement to the date March 9, 2010;</P1>
<P1>b) When the Lien was filed the only unpaid invoices of the Plaintiff were the three Invoices dated February 2, 2010, March 9, 2010 and March 9, 2010 respectively, totaling $104,684.91;</P1>
<P1>c) No invoice was ever issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the sum of $399,417.36 now claimed, prior to the filing of the Claim of Lien;</P1>
<P1>d) No demand was ever made by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for payment of the sum of $399,417.36 now claimed, until after the filing of the Claim of Lien.</P1></P>
<P>23. Prior to receipt of the Invoices and the Declaration the Defendant had paid to the Plaintiff all amounts due pursuant to the Unpaid Sub-Contracts. Such payment was made to the Plaintiff on the condition that all of the amounts due to the Unpaid Sub-Contracts were to be paid from the funds paid to the Plaintiff. This was an express or alternatively an implied term of the Contract.</P>
<P>24. The Plaintiff has refused or neglected to pay the Unpaid Sub-Contracts to date.</P>
<P>25. The amount properly due to the Plaintiff under its Contract as at the date of the last Invoice properly issued, was the sum of $104,684.91, less the Duplication amounts invoiced of $18,131.50, less the amounts due on the Unpaid Sub- Contracts referred to herein.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE the Defendant submits that the action be dismissed with costs.</P>
<P>Dated: May 17, 2010</P>
<P>&ellip35; Solicitor for the Defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Gary Walker, businessman, c/o #201, 20353 - 64<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, in the Township of Langley, in the Province of British Columbia, make oath and say that:</P>
<P>1. I am the president of the Defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc. (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;), and as such have personal knowledge of the facts and matters hereinafter deposed to save and except where stated to upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have been authorized to swear this Affidavit on behalf of the Defendant.</P>
<P>3. I have read the Statement of Defence on behalf of the Defendant in these proceedings and verily believe the facts set forth therein to be true.</P>
<P>4. At all times relevant to these proceedings, the Defendant has been the owner of the lands and premises located at 3410 Lougheed Hwy, Vancouver, BC and presently legally described as Lot 1 Block 1 Section 38 Town of Hastings Suburban Lands Plan BCP43119 (the &ldquo;Lands&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. The Plaintiff NGC Management Ltd (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;) agreed with the Defendant that it would provide services for the management of the construction of the improvement to the Lands, including the provision of labour, materials, and other services by the Plaintiff and by subcontractors to the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>6. The improvement consisted of the construction of a commercial building and related improvements to the Lands (collectively the &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. The operating mind behind the operations of NGC was at all relevant times Alfredo Hermano. He told me that he owned the Plaintiff and managed all aspects of its operations.</P>
<P>8. On December 26, 2009, I, on behalf of Lengara, met with Mr. Hermano, on behalf of NGC. At this meeting, the Plaintiff and the Defendant agreed, among other matters, that the Plaintiff was required to provide a statutory declaration to the Defendant in respect of the invoices issued by the Plaintiff to the Defendant upon substantial completion of the Improvement, prior to payment of those invoices by the Defendant.</P>
<P>9. When I met with Mr. Hermano on December 26, 2009, he assured me that all subcontractors to NGC were to be paid by NGC prior to the request for final payment of the agreed amounts which were to become due to NGC upon substantial completion of the Improvement, and that the Improvement was to be completed by January 25, 2010.</P>
<P>10. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a copy of the document signed by me on behalf of Lengara, and by Mr. Hermano on behalf of NGC, dated December 26, 2009 (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. On or about January 15, 2010, Lengara paid the balance of all invoices issued to that date by NGC pursuant to the Contract, for services to that date to the Improvement (the &ldquo;Progress Payment&rdquo;).</P>
<P>12. After the Progress Payment of January 15, 2010, Mr. Hermano caused NGC to issue further invoices for services provided by the Plaintiff to the Improvement, pursuant to the Contract. The invoices were dated February 2, 2010, March 9, 2010, and March 9, 2010, respectively. The total of the amounts invoiced by the Plaintiff to the Defendant pursuant to the three invoices was the sum of $104,648.91 (collectively the &ldquo;invoices&rdquo;). Copies of the Invoices are attached and marked as Exhibits &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; respectively.</P>
<P>13. Mr. Hermano executed a statutory declaration dated the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of February, 2010, required by the Contract, and provided it to me, in conjunction with a request for payment of the Invoices totaling $104,648.91. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; is a copy of the Statutory Declaration executed by Mr. Hermano.</P>
<P>14. The Statutory Declaration included the following declaration:
<QUOTE><P><EM>that all accounts for labour, subcontracts, products, services, and construction machinery and equipment which have been incurred directly by the Contractor in the performance of the work as required by the Contract, and for which the Owner might in any way be held responsible, have been paid in full as required by the Contract up to and including the latest progress payment received, as identified above, except for</EM>:</P>
<P><EM>1) holdback monies properly retained</EM>,</P>
<P><EM>2) payments deferred by agreement, or</EM></P>
<P><EM>3) amounts withheld by reason of legitimate dispute which have been identified to the party or parties, from whom payment has been withheld</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
(the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo;)</P>
<P>15. The Declaration made by Mr. Hermano was false. On the date the Declaration was made and on the date it was provided to the Defendant there were at least two subcontractors to the Plaintiff who had issued invoices to the Plaintiff for services to the Improvement prior to the latest Progress Payment, which invoices were not then paid, and for which the Defendant could be held responsible. The unpaid amounts to two of these subcontractors then totaled $75, 332.01 (the &ldquo;Unpaid Sub-Contracts&rdquo;).</P>
<P>16. I verily believe that Mr. Hermano must have been aware of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts when he made the Declaration because he was responsible to manage all of the business of NGC.</P>
<P>17. On becoming aware of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts I advised Mr. Hermano that Lengara was prepared to pay the amounts properly due to NGC pursuant to the Contract subject to satisfactory arrangements for payment of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts. Notwithstanding, the Plaintiff and its principal, Mr. Hermano, refused to make arrangements to pay the Unpaid Sub-Contracts and NGC caused a lien to be filed against the Lands, claiming the amount of $399,417.36.</P>
<P>18. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of a Claim of Lien which was filed against the Lands under No. XXXXXXXXXX on March 12, 2010, executed by Mr. Hermano on behalf of NGC, claiming the amount of $399,417.36 (the &ldquo;NGC Lien&rdquo;).</P>
<P>19. NGC's claims herein as appears from the NGC Lien and the Statement of Claim in these proceedings is in the sum of $399,417.36 for services allegedly provided to the Improvement on the Lands.</P>
<P>20. No invoice for the amount claimed pursuant to the NGC Lien and herein was received by Lengara prior to the filing of the NGC Lien. NGC purported to provide invoices for the amounts covering the lien amount by letter dated March 15, 2010 after the NGC Lien was filed. A copy of that letter is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P>
<P>21. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of a Claim of Lien which was filed against the Lands by Rona Revy Inc. (&ldquo;Rona&rdquo;) under No. CA1517383 on April 9, 2010. Rona was a subcontractor to NCG and claimed through NGC.</P>
<P>22. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of the Claim of Lien which was filed against the Lands by Harrigan Rentals &amp; Equipments Ltd. (&ldquo;Harrigan&rdquo;) under No. XXXXXXXXXX on April 8, 2010. Harrigan was a subcontractor to NGC and claimed through NGC.</P>
<P>23. The lien claimants, Rona and Harrigan, described in Exhibits &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; contracted directly with NGC and were subcontractors to NGC for the provisions of material or services to the Improvements on the Lands.</P>
<P>24. Lengara has paid the sums claimed by Rona by its successor in interest, 4361814 Canada Inc., in the amount of $21,727.03, and the sums claimed by Harrigan in the amount of $57,648.11 (in each case to counsel acting for such claimant) on the basis that NGC authorized such payment on account of its contract with each of those subcontractors and that such amounts were to be deducted from the amount to be secured in respect of the Plaintiff's claim of lien. Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is a copy of a letter dated August 13, 2010, to counsel for NGC, confirming the foregoing.</P>
<P>25. A total of 15 lien claims, excluding the NGC Lien, were asserted against the Lands, on or after completion of the Improvement. Much time was spent and costs incurred, from April through August 2010, to settle and discharge the liens, including the NGC Lien, from the Lands. Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; is a schedule of the said 15 claims of liens asserted against the Lands.</P>
<P>26. The Defendant also incurred significant costs and loss relating to:
<P1>a. the failure of the Plaintiff to complete the Improvement on time;</P1>
<P1>b. the refusal of the Plaintiff to properly comply with its obligations under the Contract;</P1>
<P1>c. the refusal of the Plaintiff, and Mr. Hermano, to provide all records in its possession relating to the project to the Defendant, despite demand;</P1>
<P1>d. the filing of the NGC Lien; and</P1>
<P1>e. the loss of an achor tenant who backed out of a lease because of the lien claims, in particular the NGC Lien, filed against the Lands.</P1></P>
<P>27. The loss and damages suffered in connection with the loss of the anchor tenant referred to in the proceeding paragraph were not known to be significant until early 2011 when the Defendant, despite making reasonable efforts, was unable to secure any tenant for the space the anchor tenant was to lease. That space remains without any tenant to date, at a rental loss of about $6,000 per month.</P>
<P>28. I make this Affidavit for the orders allowing the Defendant to file the Counterclaim and Third Party Notice attached as Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; and Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; respectively to the Defendant's Notice of Application dated March 5, 2012, and for security for costs, and for no improper purpose.</P>

<P><BOLD>TO: The Plaintiff and its Solicitor</BOLD></P>
<P><BOLD>TO: Alfredo Hermano</BOLD></P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge or master at the courthouse at Vancouver on July 6, 2012 at 9:45 a.m. for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc., is granted leave to file the Counterclaim and the Third Party Notice attached as Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; and Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo; to this Notice of Application and the filed Counterclaim and Third Party Notice shall be served on the Plaintiff and the Third Party, Alfredo Hermano, within seven (7) days of receipt of same by the Defendant.</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd., and Alfredo Hermano post security for costs in the amount of $50,000 and this action be stayed until security is posted.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant Lengara Ventures Inc. owns lands and premises located at 3410 Lougheed Hwy, Vancouver, BC, presently legally described as Lot 1 Block 1 Section 38 Town of Hastings Suburban Lands Plan BCP43119 (the &ldquo;Lands&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiff NGC Management Ltd (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;) agreed with the Defendant to provide services for the management of the construction of a commercial building and related improvements to the Lands (collectively the &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. The operating mind behind the operations of NGC was at all relevant times Alfredo Hermano.</P>
<P>4. On or about January 15, 2010, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the Defendant paid invoices issued to date by NGC, for services rendered to date in connection with the Improvement (the &ldquo;Progress Payment&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. The Improvement was to be completed by January 25, 2010, and the Plaintiff was to provide a statutory declaration to the Defendant upon substantial completion of the Improvement.</P>
<P>6. After the Progress Payment, Mr. Hermano provided the Defendant with a Statutory Declaration, dated the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of February, 2010, in conjunction with a request for payment of invoices totaling $104,648.91 (the &ldquo;Invoices&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. The Statutory Declaration included the following declaration:
<QUOTE><P><EM>that all accounts for labour, subcontracts, products, services, and construction machinery and equipment which have been incurred directly by the Contractor in the performance of the work as required by the Contract, and for which the Owner might in any way be held responsible, have been paid in full as required by the Contract up to and including the latest progress payment received, as identified above, except for</EM>:</P>
<P><EM>1) holdback monies properly retained</EM>,</P>
<P><EM>2) payments deferred by agreement, or</EM></P>
<P><EM>3) amounts withheld by reason of legitimate dispute which have been identified to the party or parties, from whom payment has been withheld</EM>.</P>
<P>(the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo;)</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>8. The Declaration made by Mr. Hermano was false. On the date the Declaration was made and on the date it was provided to the Defendant there were at least two subcontractors to the Plaintiff who had issued invoices for services to the Improvement prior to the Progress Payment, which invoices were not then paid, and for which the Defendant could be held responsible. The unpaid amounts to these two subcontractors then totaled $75,332.01 (the &ldquo;Unpaid Sub-Contracts&rdquo;).</P>
<P>9. As a result of the false declaration, the Defendant refused to pay the Invoices presented by the Plaintiff, without satisfactory arrangements being made for payment of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts.</P>
<P>21. Examinations for discovery have not been conducted. Trial of this matter was unilaterally reset for 5 days in June 2013.</P>
<P>22. The Plaintiff is a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of British Columbia. It is not in good standing, is named as a defendant in multiple legal proceedings, commenced in the BC Provincial Court (Small Claims Court) and BC Supreme Court, and does not have assets or property that would secure an order for costs.</P>
<P>23. Mr. Hermano is also named as a defendant in multiple legal proceedings commenced in the BC Provincial Court (Small Claims Court) and Supreme Court, and does not have any assets or property that would secure an order for costs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Extend Time to File Counterclaim and Third Party Notice</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Rule 22-4(2) grants discretion to the court to extend any time period provided for in the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>2. The following factors have been considered to determine whether it is just and convenient to extend time to permit a counterclaim to be filed:
<P1>a) what was the length of the delay between receiving the statement of claim and proposing the draft counterclaim;</P1>
<P1>b) what were the reasons for delay;</P1>
<P1>c) whether the counterclaim would be time barred but for s. 4(1) of the <EM>Limitation Act</EM>;</P1>
<P1>d) the connection between the proposed counterclaim and the claim;</P1>
<P1>e) whether there will be prejudice to the defendant, such as would arise if denial of the application to file a counterclaim would prevent the defendant from making full answer and defence to the claim brought against it; and</P1>
<P1>f) whether there will be prejudice to the plaintiff by permitting the proposed counterclaim, such as if the counterclaim would require additional investigation and potentially delay the trial of the matter.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Smith v. British Columbia</SOC><CITE>2010 BCSC 928</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) citing <CASEREF><SOC>Squamish Indian Band v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1998] BCJ No. 1726</CITE><COURTJUR>SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>3. Any delay in filing the proposed Counterclaim and Third Party Notice is not prejudicial to the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>10. The Plaintiff and Mr. Hermano, refused to make arrangements to pay the Unpaid SubContracts and NGC caused a lien to be filed against the Lands, claiming the amount of $399,417.36 for services allegedly provided to the Improvement on the Lands (the &ldquo;NGC Lien&rdquo;).</P>
<P>11. No invoice for the amount claimed pursuant to the NGC Lien was received by the Defendant prior to the filing of the NGC Lien.</P>
<P>12. The Unpaid Sub-Contracts were the subject of claims of lien filed against the Lands. The Defendant paid the sums claimed in the amounts of $21,727.03, and $57,648.11; NGC authorized such payment on account of its contract with each of those subcontractors and agreed that such amounts were to be deducted from the amount to be secured in respect of the Plaintiff's claim of lien.</P>
<P>13. The Plaintiff commenced its lawsuit on April 19, 2010. The Defendant filed its Statement of Defence on May 17, 2010. Notice of Trial was filed on June 30, 2010, setting the trial for not more than 10 days commencing on June 6, 2011.</P>
<P>14. The parties agreed in the summer of 2010 to refer the matter to either mediation or a Trial Management Conference in an effort to resolve their claims. A Judicial Settlement Conference was scheduled for April 8, 2011.</P>
<P>15. Until August 2010, the Defendant was engaged in the process of having liens filed against the Lands, including the NGC Lien, discharged.</P>
<P>16. As a result of the liens filed against the Lands, including the NGC Lien, the Defendant incurred costs and loss, including the loss of an anchor tenant, which loss was not known to be significant until early 2011 when the Defendant was unable to secure any tenant for the space the anchor tenant was to lease.</P>
<P>17. The Defendant provided to the Plaintiff a copy of a Counterclaim and Third Party Notice it intended to file mid-February 2011. The Plaintiff would not consent to the filing of the same, and the Defendant prepared an application for the same.</P>
<P>18. In April 2011, the Defendant was notified that the Plaintiff had filed a Notice of Intention to make a proposal pursuant to Division 1 of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>.</P>
<P>19. As a result of the Notice of Intention filed by the Plaintiff, the trial, a Judicial Settlement Conference, and a Trial Management Conference, set in these proceedings, were all adjourned by consent, and the Defendant making an application to extend the time to file its proposed Counterclaim and Third Party Notice was put on hold pending the Plaintiff proceeding with the claim herein.</P>
<P>20. At the end of November and in December 2011, the Defendant was informed the Plaintiff intended to proceed with its claim.</P>
<P>4. The proposed Counterclaim and Third Party Notice involve many issues of fact similar to the claim; the issues raised and relief sought are related to and connected with the subject matter of these proceedings.</P>
<P>5. The participation of Mr. Hermano in these proceedings is necessary to ensure that all matters in the proceeding may be effectually adjudicated on. The avoidance of multiple proceedings is fundamental to our rules of civil procedure.</P>
<P>6. In all the circumstances, it is just and convenient to permit the defendant to proceed with the proposed Counterclaim and Third Party Notice.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Application for Security For Costs</UNDER></TI>
<P>7. The Court has inherent jurisdiction with respect to ordering security for costs, and will act in light of all the relevant circumstances.</P>
<P>8. The Court also derives authority from s. 236 of the <EM>Business Corporations Act</EM>, RSBC 2002 c. 57, to require security for costs, and stay a proceeding until the security is given, where a corporation is a plaintiff in a proceeding and it appears that the corporation will be unable to pay a successful defendants' costs.</P>
<P>9. The power to order security for costs against an individual is to be exercised cautiously, sparingly, and only under special or egregious circumstances.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wang v. British Columbia Medical Association</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 1659</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) citing Dhillon J. in <CASEREF><SOC>Han v. Cho</SOC><CITE>2008 BCSC 1229</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>10. The governing principles for awarding security for costs against a corporate plaintiff, and in considering whether egregious circumstances exist, are:
<P1>a) The court has complete discretion whether to order security, and will act in light of all the relevant circumstances.</P1>
<P1>b) The possibility or probability that the plaintiff company will be deterred from pursuing its claim is not, without more, sufficient reason for not ordering security.</P1>
<P1>c) The court must attempt to balance the injustices arising from use of security as an instrument of oppression to stifle a legitimate claim on the one hand, and use of impecuniosity as a means of putting unfair pressure on a defendant on the other;</P1>
<P1>d) The court may have regard to the merits of the action, but should avoid going into detail on the merits unless success of failure appears obvious;</P1>
<P1>e) The court can order any amount of security up to the full amount claimed as long as the amount is more than nominal;</P1>
<P1>f) Before the court refuses to order security on the ground that it would unfairly stifle a valid claim, the court must be satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is probable that the claim would be stifled; and</P1>
<P1>g) The lateness of the application for security is a circumstance which can properly be taken into account.</P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>G.A.P. Contracting Ltd. v. 0790643 B.C. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 1059</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) citing <CASEREF><SOC>Kropp v. Swaneset Bay Golf Course</SOC><CITE>1977 CanLII 4037</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wang v. British Columbia Medical Association</SOC><CITE>2011 BCSC 1659</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII)</P1></P>
<P>11. In order to satisfy the test, a defendant has the obligation to demonstrate on a <EM>prima facie</EM> basis that the plaintiff would be unable to pay the defendant's costs in the event the plaintiffs action was to fail. If the defendant satisfies this first hurdle, the plaintiff may still avoid an order for security for costs by showing that it has sufficient exigible assets to satisfy any potential award of costs.</P>
<P>12. The public sources of information searched for evidence of exigible assets, corporate, Personal Property Registry, Land Title and court registry searches, revealed that the Plaintiff:
<P1>a) is not in good standing;</P1>
<P1>b) its sole officer and director is Mr. Hermano;</P1>
<P1>c) has no registered assets;</P1>
<P1>d) has outstanding claims against it; and</P1>
<P1>e) filed a Proposal pursuant to Division I of Part III of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>, which was approved by the Court in September 2011.</P1></P>
<P>13. The public sources of information searched for evidence of exigible assets, corporate, Personal Property Registry, Land Title and court registry searches, revealed that Mr. Hermano is:
<P1>a) the registered owner in fee simple (joint tenant) of lands legally described as Strata Lot XXXXXXXXXX District Lot XXXXXXXXXX Group XXXXXXXXXX New Westminster District Strata Plan XXXXXXXXXX, charged with a mortgage, and judgment as to the interests of Mr. Hermano</P1>
<P1>b) the defendant in proceedings commenced in both the Provincial (Small Claims) Court and Supreme Court of British Columbia, with claims against him for breach of trust, in the total amount of $200,487.77.</P1></P>
<P>14. In all the circumstances, an order for security for costs against both the plaintiff and Mr. Hermano is warranted.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Bruce Rosberg, Lawyer, of #201, 20353 - 64<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, in the Township of Langley, in the Province of British Columbia, make oath and say that:</P>
<P>1. I am counsel for the Defendant herein and as such have personal knowledge of the facts and matters hereinafter deposed to save and except where stated to upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I was consulted as counsel for the Defendant, from time to time, by Gary Walker for the Defendant, and by Alfredo Hermano, during the construction of, and in connection with, the commercial building and related improvements to the lands, described more particularly in the affidavit of Gary Walker sworn March 5, 2012.</P>
<P>3. The Plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;) commenced these proceedings by Writ and Statement of Claim filed April 19, 2010. The Defendant filed its Statement of Defence on May 17, 2010. Notice of Trial setting down the trial of this proceeding, for not more than 10 days commencing June 6, 2011, was filed by the solicitors for the Plaintiff on June 30, 2010.</P>
<P>4. The amount secured herein in respect of the claim of lien filed by NGC is less than that claimed by NGC in its Claim of Lien; NGC authorized payment of two unpaid subcontractors who had filed claims of liens against the subject lands claiming through NGC: $21,227.03 was paid to counsel for 4361814 Canada Inc., successor in interest to Rona Revy Inc., and $54,104.98 was paid to counsel for Harrigan Rentals &amp; Equipment, who were subcontractors to NCG and who had claimed through NGC.</P>
<P>5. In the summer of 2010, the parties, through me and Daniel Le Dressay, counsel for NGC, agreed to refer the matters between our respective clients to either mediation or a Trial Management Conference, in an effort to resolve their claims. In October 2010, Mr. Le Dressay requisitioned the setting down of a judicial Settlement Conference for February 14, 2011, later rescheduled to April 8, 2011.</P>
<P>6. By letter dated February 15, 2011, I provided Mr, Le Dressay with a Counterclaim and Third Party Notice the Defendant intended to file. By email sent February 16, 2011, Mr. Le Dressay advised that he would not consent to the filing of the proposed pleadings.</P>
<P>7. Mr. Le Dressay advised me by email sent April 5, 2011, and in a telephone discussion on April 6, 2011, that NGC had filed a Notice of Intention to make a proposal pursuant to Division 1 of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>.</P>
<P>8. The trial, Judicial Settlement Conference, and Trial Management Conference were adjourned subsequent to Mr. Le Dressay's advice regarding the bankruptcy proposal, by consent, and the making of an application to extend the time for the Defendant to file its Counterclaim and Third Party Notice was put on hold pending the Plaintiff proceeding with these proceedings. Attached hereto collectively as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a copy of the April 5, 2011, email from Mr. Le Dressay referred to in the preceding paragraph and my letter to Mr. Le Dressay dated April 11, 2011, confirming the foregoing.</P>
<P>9. My office received communications from the office of Mr. Le Dressay at the end of November seeking to reset the trial. I spoke with Mr. Le Dressay in December and he confirmed that NGC had dealt with certain bankruptcy issues and that it intended to proceed with its claims herein.</P>
<P>10. Lists of Documents have been exchanged, but examinations for discovery have not been conducted, I believe further lists will be exchanged.</P>
<P>11. The trial was unilaterally reset at the end of March 2012 by the office of counsel for NGC for 5 days in June 2013. Further to a telephone conversation I had with Mr. Le Dressay, it is my understanding that the trial will be reset for 10 days.</P>
<P>12. NGC is a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Searches of public registries have been conducted and based on the results of those searches, I verily believe that NGC is not in good standing and does not have any assets or property to secure an order for costs. Attached and marked as:
<P1>a) Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Company Summary showing that:
<P2>i) NGC is a British Columbia company; and</P2>
<P2>ii) Mr. Hermano is the sole director and officer of NGC.</P2></P1>
<P1>b) Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; is a true copy of Corporate Information for NGC showing that the company is not in good standing.</P1>
<P1>c) Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo; is a true copy of B.C. Land Title Search Results indicating that NGC is not the registered owner of any real property in British Columbia;</P1>
<P1>d) Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Personal Property Registry Search indicating that NGC is not the registered owner of any personal property in British Columbia;</P1>
<P1>e) Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Court Services Online Search indicating that NGC is a defendant in multiple proceedings commenced in the last two years in our Provincial (Small Claims) Court and Supreme Court.</P1>
<P1>f) Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo; is a copy of the Order Approving Proposal, in the Matter of the Proposal of NGC, BCSC, Vancouver Registry, No. B110435, together with a copy of the Report of Trustee on Proposal.</P1></P>
<P>13. I am not aware of any assets or property of Mr. Hermano that would secure an order for costs. Searches of public registries have been conducted and based on the results of those searches I verily believe that Mr. Hermano does not have assets or property to secure an order for costs. Attached and marked as:
<P1>a) Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Personal Property Registry Search indicating that Mr. Hermano is not the registered owner of any personal property in British Columbia;</P1>
<P1>b) Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Land Title Search Print showing charges against, including as to the interest of Mr. Hermano in, real property that Mr. Hermano is the registered owner in fee simple, as a joint tenant.</P1>
<P1>c) Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Court Services Online Search indicating that Mr. Hermano is the defendant in proceedings commenced in our Provincial (Small Claims) Court and Supreme Court.</P1>
<P1>d) Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo; is a copy of a Notice of Claim filed in the BC Provincial Court (Small Claims Court), Prince George Registry, Registry File Number 1138531, on January 27, 2011, alleging that NGC and Mr. Hermano committed a breach of trust by appropriating or converting all or part of funds received as trustees for uses not authorized by the trust; the total claimed is $12,522.56.</P1>
<P1>e) Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo; is a copy of a Notice of Civil Claim filed in the BC Supreme Court, Prince George Registry, No. 1140172, on November 25, 2011, alleging that Mr. Hermano committed a breach of trust by diverting funds for payment of subcontractors to other parties; judgment in the amount of $47,206.25, plus special costs, is sought against Mr. Hermano.</P1>
<P1>f) Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo; is a copy of a Notice of Civil Claim filed in the BC Supreme Court, Vancouver Registry, Court File No. VLC-S-S-118681, on December 19, 2011, alleging that New Generation Construction Ltd. committed, and Mr. Hermano acquiesced in, a breach of trust by misapplying funds received in trust; judgment in the amount of $68,233.96, plus interest, up to December 2011 in the amount of $72,525.00, and costs, is sought jointly and severally against Mr. Hermano and New Generation Construction Ltd.</P1>
<P1>g) Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo; is a true copy of a BC Company Summary showing that:
<P2>i) New Generation Construction Ltd. is a British Columbia company;</P2>
<P2>ii) Alfredo Hermano is also this company's sole director and officer; and</P2>
<P2>iii) the registered and records office of this company, and the mailing address for Mr. Hermano, is the same as that for NGC.</P2></P1></P>
<P>14. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo; is a copy of a draft Bill of Costs of the Defendant, which conservatively estimates the costs and disbursements to defend these proceedings through a 10 day trial. The Defendant however intends to seek special costs at trial, including because it is alleged by the Defendant that an amount is due to NGC pursuant to its agreement with NGC, but NGC has nonetheless continued its claims, in circumstances where its claim is supported by a false claim of lien filed further to a false declaration of Mr. Hermano personally on behalf of NGC.</P>
<P>15. I make this Affidavit in support of the orders sought in the Defendant's Notice of Application dated March 5, 2012, and for no improper purpose.</P>

<P>Application response of: Alfredo Hermano and NGC Management Ltd., (the &ldquo;application respondents&rdquo;)</P>
<P>THIS IS A RESPONSE TO the notice of application of Lengara Ventures Ltd. filed April 24, 2012.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS CONSENTED TO</TI>

<P>NONE</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>ORDERS OPPOSED</TI>
<P>The application respondents oppose the granting of the orders set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Part 1 of the notice of application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>ORDERS ON WHICH NO POSITION IS TAKEN</TI>
<P>The application respondents take no position on the granting of the orders set out in none of the paragraphs of Part 1 of the notice of application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>4:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P><P1>1. This is a claim made by the plaintiff against the defendant for debt for services supplied, and a claim by the plaintiff to enforce a builder's lien.</P1>
<P1>2. This action was commenced on April 19, 2010.</P1>
<P1>3. The plaintiff alleges that it had a construction management contract with the defendant. That contract is in writing and is Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to Mr. Hermano's affidavit. Mr. Hermano, the president of the plaintiff deposes, and the contract says, that unless otherwise agreed, the defendant would engage the sub-trades and pay the sub-trades. Mr. Hermano says that the plaintiff only engaged a rental company and a lumber company.</P1>
<P1>4. The statement of defence admits that a contract in writing dated March 12, 2009 was entered into, but then the defence says &ldquo;between March 12, 2009 and December 26, 2009&rdquo; the written contract was amended. &ldquo;Among&rdquo; the alleged changes were a reduction in the plaintiff's fees (without a pleading that there was any consideration for this reduction), and that a statutory declaration was to be provided by the plaintiff to the defendant on substantial completion, such declaration affirming that there were no claims relating to the works from those contracted with by the plaintiff that could affect the defendant, again without any pleading that there was some consideration for this amendment to a pre-existing contractual duty.</P1>
<P1>5. The defence does not say when the date of substantial completion was but the defence does allege that on March 1, 2010 an occupancy permit was granted for the building.</P1>
<P1>6. The defence alleges that on February 24, 2010 Mr. Hermano swore a false statutory declaration. It is alleged that there were two liens filed after that declaration was sworn thus indicating, the defendant alleges, that it was false.</P1>
<P1>7. The defendant did not pay to the plaintiff any amounts as a result of that alleged false statutory declaration. Mr. Hermano says that the declaration was not false. He says that the arrangements he had with the two lien claimants were that their accounts were due and payable when the plaintiff was paid.</P1>
<P1>8. There is no allegation in the statement of defence, in the counterclaim or in the third party notice that the defendant ever relied in any way on the alleged false statutory declaration to its detriment or otherwise.</P1>
<P1>9. To the contrary, the defendant alleges that when it found out the statutory declaration was allegedly untrue, it stopped paying the plaintiff. There was no reliance and the necessary inference from the defendant's pleadings is that the defendant did not in any way rely upon the alleged false statutory declaration to its detriment or otherwise.</P1>
<P1>10. The defence alleges that the claim of client that the plaintiff filed is false.</P1>
<P1>11. The defence alleges at paragraph 25 that something is owed to the plaintiff, but it is less than the amount the plaintiff is claiming. No claim is made in the defence for breach of contract, or damages, or set off of damages.</P1>
<P1>12. The counterclaim repeats the statement of defence.</P1>
<P1>13. The counterclaim then pleads section 45 of the <EM>Builders Lien Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>14. Section 45 of the <EM>Builders Lien Act</EM> creates an offence of filing a claim of lien containing a false statement. Section 45 does not create a civil cause of action to be exercised by private parties.</P1>
<P1>15. Mr. Hermano is not joined as a defendant by the counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>16. The counterclaim alleges that Mr. Hermano and the plaintiff knew the claim of lien was false when it was filed.</P1>
<P1>17. The counterclaim then alleges that Mr. Hermano and the plaintiff were &ldquo;responsible for the issuance of the false Declaration&rdquo;. The counterclaim then specifically pleads at paragraph 5 that the defendant did not make payment on the contract after the false declaration&mdash;by necessary inference the defendant was not induced to do anything to its detriment as a result of the alleged false declaration nor does the defendant in any way allege that it relied on the false declaration and that reliance caused or contributed to any loss.</P1>
<P1>18. Paragraph 6 of the counterclaim alleges that Mr. Hermano and the plaintiff refused to complete their obligations under the contract (no allegation is made anywhere that Mr. Hermano entered into any contract with the defendant or was somehow privy to a contract with the defendant) and then in the same paragraph it is alleged that Mr. Hermano and the plaintiff have maintained the claim of lien and this action &ldquo;with reckless indifference to the legitimate interests of the Defendant&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>19. The plaintiff then claims these matters somehow caused it loss by the plaintiff having to pay 15 liens and that the contract completion was delayed. No facts are pled that these liens were obligations of the plaintiff. No facts are pled that the contract was delayed.</P1>
<P1>20. No relief is sought specifically against Mr. Hermano in Part 2, but punitive damages are sought, presumably, against all parties; without pleadings of facts that would substantiate a claim to punitive damages. (<CASEREF><SOC>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[2002] S.C.J. No. 19</CITE></CASEREF>)</P1>
<P1>21. The entire purported legal basis of the counterclaim is summarized by the defendant in two short paragraphs. The defendant says that the acts of Mr. Hermano were not as an agent of the company but he acted in a &ldquo;tortuous&rdquo; manner and exhibited a &ldquo;separate identity&rdquo; from the company. What the tort that Mr. Hermano may have committed is not revealed in the counterclaim. Mr. Hermano is not joined as a defendant by counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>22. The second legal basis is that the corporate veil is sought to be pierced on the theory that this is a case of &ldquo;improper conduct&rdquo;. Again, Mr. Hermano is not joined as a defendant by counterclaim.</P1>
<P1>23. The defendant then seeks leave to file and serve a third party notice against Mr. Hermano personally. <BOLD><UNDER>The only relief sought against Mr. Hermano personally in that third party notice is costs.</UNDER></BOLD> No damages, debt or any other relief other than costs is sought against Mr. Hermano.</P1>
<P1>24. The third party notice repeats the defence, relies on the offence section of the <EM>Builders Lien Act</EM>, s. 45, and then a claim is made that Mr. Hermano and the plaintiff knowingly filed a false claim of lien.</P1>
<P1>25. The same allegations as pleaded in the counterclaim are repeated in the third party notice and the same legal basis is propounded to support the third party claim. Again, the third party proceedings do not seek relief by indemnification or co-responsibility with the defendant&mdash;only costs is sought.</P1>
<P1>26. In support of the application for security for costs the defendant adduces evidence that the plaintiff has outstanding lawsuits against it. The plaintiff adduces evidence that as a result of the defendant not paying its debt to the defendant the defendant suffered financially, eventually taking the lawful and responsible recourse to an accepted proposal to creditors made pursuant to the Bankruptcy and <EM>Insolvency Act</EM>.</P1>
<P1>27. The plaintiff is an operating company employing 10 people. Mr. Hermano deposes that the plaintiff cannot pay $50,000 in security for costs&mdash;the result of an order for security for costs then being that a debtor, the defendant, who has caused financial hardship to the plaintiff, is able to stifle the claim of its victim to collect a just debt.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P><P1>1. In order for pleadings to be amended a cause of action must be stated. (<CASEREF><SOC>Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. v. Concord Pacific Group Inc.</SOC><YEAR>2009</YEAR><CITE>2009 BCSC 203</CITE></CASEREF>) The legal basis of the application does not identify any cause of action nor can any cause of action known, as of yet, to the common law, equity or by statute be reasonably discerned from either the proposed counter-claim or third party claim.</P1>
<P1>2. Assuming that the cause of actions that are intended to be pleaded have something to do with the alleged false statutory declaration and are an attempt to pierce the corporate veil, then the pleadings are wanting.</P1>
<P1>3. A pleading of fraudulent misrepresentation requires that the representation was (a) false, (b) made knowing it was false, (c) made with the intention that the counter-party would act upon it or rely upon it; (d) the counter-party did act upon it or relied upon it; and (e) as a result of that reliance or action the counter-party suffered loss. (Lord Brennan Q.C. ed., <EM>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings</EM>, 15<SUP>th</SUP> ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, (2004) Vol. 2 page 799; G.H.L. Fridman, <EM>The Law of Torts in Canada</EM>, 3<SUP>rd</SUP> ed. (Toronto: Carswell (2010)) at pp. 709&ndash;718). Alternatively, the pleading must at least allege (a) a knowingly false representation, (b) loss and (c) that the false representation caused the loss, with the burden of reliance then shifting to the person alleged to have made the representation. (<CASEREF><SOC>Roy v. 1216393 Ontario Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2011] B.C.J. No. 2351</CITE></CASEREF>).</P1>
<P1>4. Assuming any of the elements of a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation have been pled in fact and law, which they have not, the defendant specifically pleads that it did not rely on the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, but as a result of the fraudulent misrepresentation it did not pay its debt due to the plaintiff. Based on the facts and law as pleaded in the proposed counterclaim and third party notice no detrimental reliance can be discerned or proved.</P1>
<P1>5. To attribute personal responsibility to a director of a corporation for acts done in that capacity requires that the corporate identity be disregarded. This is only rarely done, and requires evidence of a deliberate wrongdoing and that the company is being used as a cloak to perpetrate a fraud. (Kevin McGuinness, <EM>Halsbury's Laws of Canada, Business Corporations I</EM>, 1<SUP>st</SUP> ed., (Toronto; Lexis Nexis (2008) pp. 241&ndash;244). No facts have been pled to ground an allegation that there was deliberate wrongdoing by Mr. Hermano and that the plaintiff was a cloak for fraud.</P1>
<P1>6. Assuming the theory for personal liability is that Mr. Hermano induced a breach of contract by the plaintiff, this theory is not tenable at law, without an allegation of fraud acting in his personal capacity. (<CASEREF><SOC>Said v. Butt</SOC><CITE>[1920] 3 K.B. 497</CITE><COURTJUR>K.B.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Einhorn v. Westmount Investments Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1970</YEAR><CITE>11 D.L.R. (3rd) 509</CITE></CASEREF>.).</P1>
<P1>7. The only relief sought in the proposed third party proceedings is an order for costs or special costs against Mr. Hermano. It is submitted that as the defendant has sought to restrict the relief sought to costs, there is no need for the court to exercise its discretion to grant leave for third party proceedings (<CASEREF><SOC>Lui v. West Granville Manor Ltd.</SOC><YEAR>1985</YEAR><CITE>61 B.C.L.R. 315</CITE></CASEREF>) as there is jurisdiction for this Court to order costs against a non-party without the necessity, and unnecessary prolixity, of further pleadings and proceedings. (<CASEREF><SOC>H.M. v. J.A.S.</SOC><YEAR>2008</YEAR><CITE>289 D.L.R. (4th) 315</CITE></CASEREF>.)</P1>
<P1>8. The applicants have not made out a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that the defendant is unable to pay costs. The defendant is an operating company that has acted responsibly to deal with the financial calamity produced by the defendant, has endured despite the defendant's failure to pay its just debt and there is no reason to believe that the plaintiff could not pay costs&mdash;at least over time. Even if the defendant has proven impecuniosity, then it is submitted that the court should exercise its discretionary jurisdiction not to order security for costs on the principle that such an order would allow a wrongdoer to stifle the claim brought by the victim of the wrongdoer to remedy the harm done by the wrongdoer. (<CASEREF><SOC>Kropp v. Swaneset Bay Golf Course Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1997] B.C.J. No. 593</CITE></CASEREF>, <CASEREF><SOC>Integrated Contractors Ltd. v. Leduc Developments Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2009] B.C.J.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, ALFREDO HERMANO, businessman of 201-856 Homer Street in the City of Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia make oath and say as follows;
<P1>1. I am the president of the plaintiff and as such I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters referred to in this affidavit except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P1>
<P1>2. The contract between NGC Management Ltd. and Lengara Ventures Ltd. was a construction management contract. A copy of the first 22 pages of that contract are attached as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; to this my affidavit.</P1>
<P1>3. This contract was a very large contract for the plaintiff. At the time the plaintiff entered into this contract, I had many discussions with Mr. Walker to make sure that he intended to pay the plaintiff and to pay the sub-trades. The contract required him to pay all of the sub-trades. The plaintiff was to pay a rental company and a lumber supplier.</P1>
<P1>4. Mr. Walker is the president of the defendant. Throughout this contract the sub-trades complained to me that they were not being paid by the defendant. When I would confront Mr. Walker with this, Mr. Walker would make excuses for not paying the sub-trades. Usually these complaints would be technical things, such as scope of work and his interpretation of the sub-contract differing with that of the sub- contractor. Mr. Walker would also complain that the subcontractor's costs were too high-even though he had signed their sub-contracts that told him what the costs were. Throughout the contract Mr. Walker was causing the defendant not to pay the sub-trades and this caused delay, and this hurt the plaintiff's reputation and relationship with these sub-trades. I had told the sub-trades that my initial view was that Mr. Walker was honourable and paid his bills. I was wrong.</P1>
<P1>5. Mr. Walker insisted I swear statutory declarations before each draw. I told Mr. Walker that the funds that the defendant would pay would be used to pay the rental company and the lumber company. Both the rental company, Harrigan Rentals and Rona Revy&mdash;formerly Dick's lumber&mdash;had agreed with me to be paid when I was paid. Therefore, I am of the view that the statutory declarations in this matter that I swore were all true.</P1>
<P1>6. The Defendant did not pay the Plaintiff and did not pay its sub-trades. As a result the plaintiff filed a lien and sub-trades filed a lien. When the plaintiff was not paid by the defendant, Rona Revy and Harrigan Rentals filed liens as the plaintiff was not paid.</P1>
<P1>7. The lien claim is not inflated because Mr. Walker unilaterally took it upon himself to take the plaintiff's invoices, reduce the rates, and tender the reduced amount. The defendant simply did not pay its bills. Eventually the situation became intolerable for the plaintiff's business resulting in the plaintiff liening the project in March, 2010 and stopping work due to non-payment by the defendant.</P1>
<P1>8. When the defendant did not pay the plaintiff this caused severe financial hardship to the plaintiff, resulting in the plaintiff having to make a proposal to its creditors pursuant Division 1 of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>. That proposal was accepted by the creditors. The plaintiff paid $300,000 to its creditors to resolve about $1,400,000 in debt. The proposal will be paid over a five year period and all payments have been made to date. The proposal will be finished in September, 2016.</P1>
<P1>9. The plaintiff has carried on with business, although the defendant nearly bankrupted the plaintiff by the defendant not paying its debt to the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>10. The plaintiff has some cash flow and some on-going work. The construction industry in Vancouver and the surrounding area is very difficult at this time.</P1>
<P1>11. The plaintiff cannot afford to pay $50,000 in security for costs. The reason the plaintiff could not pay its bills since 2010, was because the defendant did not pay its bills to the plaintiff.</P1>
<P1>12. The plaintiff is carrying on business as best it can. The plaintiff employs about ten full time people. This debt has been outstanding for two years and is a substantial burden to the plaintiff.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Gary Walker, businessman, c/o #201, 20353 - 64<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, in the Township of Langley, in the Province of British Columbia, make oath and say that:</P>
<P>1. I am the president of the Defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;), and as such have personal knowledge of the facts and matters hereinafter deposed to save and except where stated to upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have been authorized to swear this Affidavit on behalf of the Defendant.</P>
<P>3. This Affidavit is in response to Affidavit No. 1 of Alfredo Hermano sworn June 28, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Hermano Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. For simplicity, I adopt the definitions in my Affidavit sworn March 5, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;G. Walker #3 Affidavit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. In response to paragraph 2 of the Hermano Affidavit and the excerpt of the Canadian Construction Association Introduction to CCA No. 5-1988 Standard Construction Management Contract Form (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Original Contract&rdquo;), marked as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; and attached to the Hermano Affidavit, the Original Contract was not followed by the Plaintiff, and was amended, from time to time, orally and in writing, lastly as set out in the document marked Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; that is attached to the G. Walker #3 Affidavit.</P>
<P>6. In response to paragraph 3 of the Hermano Affidavit:
<P1>a. I had never been involved in, overseen or managed the construction of any commercial building, and relied solely on Mr. Hermano and his company, which was retained because he told me of his knowledge and expertise in the management of the type of construction required for the Improvement;</P1>
<P1>b. there were no discussions with Mr. Hermano about the Defendant paying the Plaintiff or sub-trades at the time the Original Contract was entered into; and</P1>
<P1>c. if Mr. Hermano is referring to the Original Contract, it was not followed by the Plaintiff and was amended, from time to time: for example, the Plaintiff engaged trade contractors on its own and the target complete date of October 2009 was not achieved.</P1></P>
<P>7. In response to paragraph 4 of the Hermano Affidavit:
<P1>a. it is untrue that I, or the Defendant, did not pay, or complained about having to pay, any sub-trades;</P1>
<P1>b. trade contractors communicated through Mr. Hermano or the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>c. I was never made aware of any complaints by sub-trades about not being paid by the Defendant;</P1>
<P1>d. I caused the Defendant to pay sub-trades as advised by Mr. Hermano or the Plaintiff, after I was in receipt of proper documentation, and all payments were made in a timely manner;</P1>
<P1>e. it is untrue that I caused the Defendant not to pay sub-trades; and</P1>
<P1>f. it is also untrue that I or the Defendant was/were the cause of any delay or damage to the Plaintiff's reputation or relationship with any sub-trades.</P1></P>
<P>8. In response to paragraph 5 of the Hermano Affidavit:
<P1>a. the reason why the statutory declarations were required by the Defendant was that the Defendant was aware that the Plaintiff was sub-contracting (notwithstanding the Original Contract) to various trades;</P1>
<P1>b. when the Contract was made in December 2009, I discussed with Mr. Hermano that statutory declaration were required to ensure that all amounts owing to trades contracting through the Plaintiff were paid;</P1>
<P1>c. Mr. Hermano and the Plaintiff never advised me or the Defendant that any sub-trades remained unpaid prior to delivery of any statutory declarations;</P1>
<P1>d. when Mr. Hermano presented the Declaration in conjunction with the request for payment of the Invoices, he did not tell me that the funds that the Defendant would pay would be used to pay the rental company or the lumber company;</P1>
<P1>e. both personally and through counsel there were numerous dealings with Mr. Hermano and the Plaintiff after the issuance of the Declaration; and</P1>
<P1>f. at no time prior to the Hermano Affidavit has Mr. Hermano ever said to me, my counsel or the Defendant, that it was his intention to pay the rental company or the lumber company from the proceeds of the Invoices.</P1></P>
<P>9. In response to paragraph 6 of the Hermano Affidavit, I do not know what sub-trades Mr. Hermano is referring to that the Defendant did not pay. I caused the Defendant to pay paid sub-trades as required and/or as advised by Mr. Hermano or the Plaintiff, in a timely manner.</P>
<P>10. In response to paragraph 7 of the Hermano Affidavit, I do not know which of the Plaintiff's invoices Mr. Hermano is referring to.</P>
<P>11. In further response to paragraph 7 and in response to paragraph 9 of the Hermano Affidavit:
<P1>a. the Original Contract, amended from time to time, was entered into in March 2009, with a target completion date of October 2009;</P1>
<P1>b. October 2009 came and went and Mr. Hermano and I agreed on December 26, 2009, that the Plaintiff would have the building completed and ready for occupancy by January 25, 2010;</P1>
<P1>c. a temporary Occupancy permit was not issued until March 1, 2010;</P1>
<P1>d. by letter dated March 15, 2010 the Plaintiff advised that it would not provide further services and that it would withhold all documents and information from the Defendant, which it did, unless the NGC Lien was paid;</P1>
<P1>e. the Plaintiff invoiced the Defendant and there were issues raised, from time to time, about various construction issues, which included services rendered by the Plaintiff, delays in construction, and invoices;</P1>
<P1>f. the above-noted issues were resolved from time to time in the normal course, which included agreed changes to the Original Contract;</P1>
<P1>g. I advised Mr. Hermano after becoming aware of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts that the Defendant was prepared to pay the amounts properly due to NGC pursuant to the Contract subject to satisfactory arrangements for payment of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts, but Mr. Hermano refusing to agree to satisfactory arrangements for payment of the Unpaid Sub-Contracts.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF APPLICATION</TI>
<P>Name of Applicant: The Defendant, Lengara Ventures inc.</P>
<P>To: The Plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd.</P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge or master at the courthouse at the Law Courts, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver British Columbia on <BOLD>December 14, 2016</BOLD>, at 9:45 a.m. for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. An order dismissing the plaintiffs claims for want of prosecution, and that the dismissal be and is of the same effect as if its claims had been dismissed after a trial on its merits.</P>
<P>2. A declaration and order that the Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit, issued by the Canadian Western Bank, with the Registrar of the Court, as security for the claim of lien registered under number XXXXXXXXXX, in the amount of $323,585.35, be returned to the Canadian Western Bank, without further order, direction or other action.</P>
<P>3. Costs payable to the defendant forthwith.</P>
<P>4. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. The Defendant / Applicant, Lengara Ventures Inc. (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;) owns lands and premises located at 3410 Lougheed Hwy, Vancouver, BC, presently legally described as Lot 1 Block 1 Section 38 Town of Hastings Suburban Lands Plan BCP43119 (the &ldquo;Lands&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Lengara is actively engaged in the business of property development, in conjunction with related companies, the &ldquo;No. 1 Collision Group of Companies&rdquo; which operate auto body repair service shops.</P>
<P>3. On or about March 12, 2009, NGC and Lengara entered into a written contract in connection with the construction of a commercial building and related improvements to the Land (the &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;), from which, since 2010, one of the No. 1 Collision Group of Companies has operated an auto body repair service shop.</P>
<P>4. Virtually all dealings between NGC and Lengara in respect of the construction of the Improvement were between Gary Walker (&ldquo;Gary&rdquo;) and Alfredo Hermano, president of NGC. Gary will be 70 years of age in December 2016, and his mental acuity, including his memory, focus, concentration and understanding, is not as it was.</P>
<P>5. The written contract was amended from time to time, orally and in writing, including on December 26, 2009, when it was agreed NGC would provide a statutory declaration in respect of invoices issued by NGC to Lengara upon substantial completion of the Improvement (which was to be completed by January 25, 201 0).</P>
<P>6. On or about January 15, 2010, Lengara paid invoices issued by NGC, for services rendered to date in connection with the Improvement (the &ldquo;Progress Payment&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. After the Progress Payment, Mr. Hermano provided Lengara with a Statutory Declaration, dated the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of February, 2010, in conjunction with a request for payment of invoices totaling $104,648.91 (the &ldquo;Invoices&rdquo;).</P>
<P>8. The Declaration made by Mr. Hermano was false; on the date the Declaration was made and on the date it was provided to Lengara there were at least two subcontractors to NGC who had issued invoices for services to the Improvement prior to the Progress Payment, which invoices were not then paid (the &ldquo;Unpaid Sub&mdash;Contracts&rdquo;), and for which Lengara could be held responsible.</P>
<P>9. As a result of the false declaration, Lengara refused to pay the Invoices, without satisfactory arrangements being made for payment of the Unpaid Sub -Contracts.</P>
<P>10. On March 12, 2010, NGC filed a Claim of Lien against the title to the Lands under number XXXXXXXXXX in the amount of $399,417.36 (the &ldquo;NGC Lien&rdquo;). No invoice for this amount claimed was received by Lengara prior to the filing of the NGC Lien.</P>
<P>11. The Unpaid Sub-Contracts were the subject of claims of lien filed on April 8 and 9, 2010, against the Lands, in the amounts of $21,727.03, and $57,648.11.</P>
<P>12. On April 19, 2010, NGC filed a Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim and registered a Certificate of Pending Litigation against the Lands, under number XXXXXXXXXX, alleging breach of the written contract between NGC and Lengara, and claiming the sum of $399,417.36, plus interest at the rate of 10% above the prime rate per annum, for services allegedly provided in relation to the Improvement.</P>
<P>13. On April 23, 2010, Lengara filed and served an Appearance and delivered a Demand for Discovery of Documents and Notice to Produce.</P>
<P>14. On April 26, 2010, NGC delivered a Demand for Discovery of Documents and Notice to Produce.</P>
<P>15. On May 17, 2010, Lengara filed a Statement of Defence, saying, among other things, that the written contract was amended from time to time by further agreements made between April 9, 2009 and December 26, 2009, and that Mr. Hermano, the principal and operating mind behind the operations of NGC, knowingly executed a false statutory declaration that included a statement that all subcontractors to NGC had been paid.</P>
<P>16. On June 30, 2010, NGC filed a Notice of Trial, setting the trial for 10 days, commencing June 6, 2011.</P>
<P>17. On July 26, 2010, Lengara filed a Notice of Application returnable August 12, 2010, seeking orders authorizing payments for the Unpaid Sub-Contracts, in the amounts of their lien claims, on account of contracts with NGC, and to discharge the NGC's Lien upon posting security.</P>
<P>18. On July 27, 2010, NGC delivered a List of Documents.</P>
<P>19. On August 13, 2010, the Honourable Master Donaldson made an order, by consent of the parties, canceling the NGC Lien and Certificate of Pending Litigation, on payment into court by Lengara of $323,585.35, as security for the NGC Lien.</P>
<P>20. On August 30, 2010, Lengara deposited funds in the amount of $323,585.35 into court, in accordance with the Order of the Honourable Master Donaldson.</P>
<P>21. On September 2, 2010, NGC delivered an Appointment to Examine For Discovery, to examine Gary, as the representative for Lengara, on October 5, 2010, which discovery was cancelled on September 22, 2010.</P>
<P>22. On October 15, 2010, Lengara requested documents from NGC's List of Documents.</P>
<P>23. On October 28, 2010, NGC filed a Requisition to set a settlement conference for February 14, 2011. The same was delivered by fax sent November 19, 2010.</P>
<P>24. On November 23, 2010, Lengara delivered a List of Documents. We have no record of NGC making a request for a copy of the documents disclosed by Lengara.</P>
<P>25. By letter dated November 23, 2010, NGC provided copies of its listed documents to Lengara, as Lengara had requested.</P>
<P>26. On December 20, 2010, NGC filed a Requisition to set a trial management conference for April 27, 2011.</P>
<P>27. On December 31, 2010, Lengara filed an Application, returnable January 13, 2011, seeking to vary the Order of the Honourable Master Donaldson to substitute the security deposited with a letter of credit.</P>
<P>28. On January 13, 2011, the Honourable Master Tokarek varied the Order of the Honourable Master Donaldson to permit Lengara to deposit a letter of credit in substitution for the funds deposited. Despite request, NGC did not consent, and did not file responsive materials or attend at the hearing of this application.</P>
<P>29. On January 24, 2011, NGC filed a Requisition to reschedule the settlement conference, from February 14, 2011, to April 8, 2011.</P>
<P>30. Pursuant to the Order of the Honourable Master Tokarek, Lengara deposited an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit issued by the Canadian Western Bank, dated January 31, 2011, with the Registrar of the Court, as security for the NGC Lien, in substitution for funds Lengara had previously deposited with the Registrar of the Court, in the amount of $323,585.35 (the &ldquo;Letter of Credit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>31. As a term of providing the Letter of Credit, Lengara is required to keep $323,585.35 in a GIC account with the Canadian Western Bank, as security for the Letter of Credit. Lengara receives nominal interest on funds in this GIC account, currently 0. 7% per annum, however its cost of borrowing is substantially higher. The cost to maintain the Letter of Credit is 1.00% per annum ($3,235.85 annually).</P>
<P>32. On April 5, 2011, Daniel Le Dressay, counsel for NGC, emailed Bruce Rosberg, counsel for Lengara, advising that NGC had filed a Notice of Intention to make a proposal pursuant to Division 1 of the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM>.</P>
<P>33. On April 6, 2011, NGC filed a Requisition to adjourn generally, by consent, the settlement conference set for April 8, 2011, the trial management conference set for April 27, 2011, and the trial set for June 6, 2011.</P>
<P>34. On December 7, 2011, NGC delivered an Appointment to Examine For Discovery, to examine Gary, as the representative for Lengara, for February 13, 2013.</P>
<P>35. On March 23, 2012, NGC filed a Notice of Trial, resetting the trial, for 5 days, commencing June 3, 2013, with counsel for Lengara as to the date or reduced days, from 10 to 5 days.</P>
<P>36. On April 11, 2012, NGC filed a Notice of Case Planning Conference setting a case planning conference for August 29, 2012.</P>
<P>37. On April 24, 2012, Lengara filed a Notice of Application, seeking leave to file a Counterclaim and Third Party Notice, and for security for costs.</P>
<P>38. On July 6, 2012, the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher, among other things, granted Lengara leave to file a Counterclaim, and ordered NGC to post security for costs in the amount of $20,000 and stayed this proceeding until said security was posted.</P>
<P>39. On or about July 19, 2012, the examination for discovery of Mr. Walker set for February 13, 2013, was cancelled.</P>
<P>40. On July 26, 2012, Lengara filed a Counterclaim, in accordance with the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher made July 6, 2012, and served the same by fax to Mr. Le Dressay, whose office faxed back the service copy of the letter covering the Counterclaim, with only the date of service written in as July 27, 2012.</P>
<P>41. On August 15, 2012, NGC served a Requisition filed August 14, 2012, adjourning, the case management conference set for August 29, 2012, generally by consent.</P>
<P>42. On November 9, 2012, NGC served a Requisition filed November 8, 2012, adjourning the trial set for June 3, 2013, generally by consent.</P>
<P>43. On February 22, 2016, NGC filed and served a Notice of Appointment or Change of Lawyer appointing Garrett Munroe to act as its lawyer in place of Mr. Le Dressay.</P>
<P>44. NGC has not, within a reasonable period of time, or at ail, complied with the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher made July 6, 2012, to post security for costs.</P>
<P>45. NGC has not filed a Response to Counterclaim, within the time permitted by the Supreme Court civil rules, or at all.</P>
<P>46. NGC has done absolutely nothing to advance its claims towards trial, at best, since March 23, 2012, when it unilaterally filed a Notice of Trial, which date was subsequently adjourned generally.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Dismissal for Want of Prosecution</EM></TI>
<P>1. Rule 22-7(7) grants discretion to the court, on application by a party, to dismiss a proceeding if it appears that there is want of prosecution.</P>
<P>2. In considering an application to dismiss, the court must primarily consider whether:
<P1>a. the delay is inordinate, given the facts, and nature, of the case;</P1>
<P1>b. the delay is inexcusable; and</P1>
<P1>c. the defendant is likely to be prejudiced by the delay;</P1>
and then consider whether, and on balance, justice requires dismissal of the action.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Irving v. Irving</SOC><CITE>1982 CanLII 475</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ed Bulley Ventures Ltd. v The Pantry Hospitality Corporation</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 52</CITE></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Trak Energy Corporation v. Happy Valley Resort Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2015 BCSC 1928</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Inordinate Delay</EM></TI>
<P>3. In assessing whether delay is inordinate, it is the overall delay in prosecuting the action once a plaintiff has enlisted the judicial process as a forum for adjudication, and not necessarily just the delay calculated from the last step in a proceeding, that is usually to be considered.
<P1><EM>Ed Bulley Ventures</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>4. The following amounts to inordinate delay:
<P1>a. it has been more than six and a half (6<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>) years since the NGC Lien was filed;</P1>
<P1>b. it has been more than six and a half (6<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>) years since NGC commenced these proceedings;</P1>
<P1>c. it has been more than six (6) years since NGC delivered its List of Documents;</P1>
<P1>d. it has been almost six (6) years since Lengara provided copies of its documents, pursuant to Lengara's request for the same;</P1>
<P1>e. it has been more than four and a half (4<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>) years since NGC unilaterally reset these proceedings for trial, which trial was adjourned generally on November 8, 2012; and</P1>
<P1>f. it has been more than four (4) years since the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher ordered NGC to post $20,000 as security for costs and stayed its claim until said security was posted.</P1></P>
<P>5. NGC has taken virtually no substantive steps to advance its claim. It has not:
<P1>a. requested / discovered documents from Lengara's List of Documents;</P1>
<P1>b. conducted any examination for discovery;</P1>
<P1>c. complied with the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher, to post security for costs;</P1>
<P1>d. filed a Response to Lengara's Counterclaim, within the time required, or at all; or</P1>
<P1>e. reset the matter for trial.</P1></P>
<P>6. A plaintiff cannot rely on applications made by a defendant to establish that it has not delayed in prosecuting its claims.
<P1><EM>Trak Energy Corporation</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>7. Lengara submits that the last substantive step NGC took was to provide its List of Documents, in July 2010, more than six (6) years ago; setting and subsequently adjourning or cancelling dates, has done nothing to advance NGC's claims.</P>
<P>8. The <EM>Builders Lien Act</EM> provides an extraordinary remedy and claimants are expected to pursue their claims expeditiously; there is an expectation of expediency in builder's lien cases, a fact to be considered in assessing inordinate delay.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hanna's Construction Services Ltd. v Blue River III Inc.</SOC><CITE>2006 BCCA 142</CITE></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><EM>Trak Energy Corporation</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>9. A delay of more than six (6) years since the commencement of proceedings, especially in a builder's lien case, where no significant steps have been taken and none for more than four and a half (4<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>) years, represents a serious failure by a plaintiff to proceed in a timely fashion. In all of the circumstances of this case, NGC's delay has been inordinate.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Inexcusable Delay</EM></TI>
<P>10. Whether inordinate delay is inexcusable depends on the explanation for it, if any, and the surrounding circumstances. The lack of a credible excuse will attract an inference that the delay cannot be excused.
<P1><EM>Irving</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>11. Lengara is not aware of any excuse or justification for NGC's failure to advance its claims at all for more than four and a half (4<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>) years.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Prejudice</EM></TI>
<P>12. Once inordinate and inexcusable delay has been established, the defendant is presumed to have suffered serious prejudice. The onus is on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant would not be prejudiced.
<P1><EM>Ed Bulley Ventures</EM>, supra</P1>
<P1><EM>Trak Energy Corporation</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>13. In addition to the presumption of prejudice, Lengara has suffered actual prejudice.</P>
<P>14. Tying up property to secure a claim, whether land or cash, for a substantial period of time, is a significant example of specific prejudice.
<P1><EM>Trak Energy Corporation</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>15. NGC has tied up Lengara's property, first its land and then its cash, for more than six (6) years. Not only is Lengara required to keep $323,585.35 in a G!C account with the Canadian Western Bank, as security for the Letter of Credit, Lengara has to pay an annual fee of $3,235.86, to maintain the Letter of Credit. To date this amounts to $16,179.25.</P>
<P>16. More significantly, this is a case of disputed facts which must be determined from oral testimony of witnesses, in particular Gary and Mr. Hermano.</P>
<P>17. There is always the possibility that memories will be lost and recollections will fade as a result of the passage of time. In this case, because of NGC's inordinate delay, Lengara will not likely have the best evidence available to it from its essential witness Gary, who is reported to have mental acuity issues, and would, if these proceedings are not dismissed, have to recall events from, at this date, almost seven (7) years ago.</P>
<P>18. Additionally, the accrual of interest payable on an amount alleged owed may also give rise to prejudice.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia v. Therrien</SOC><CITE>[1999] B.C.J. No. 1038</CITE><COURTJUR>S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>19. NGC has claimed the sum of $399,417.36, <UNDER>plus interest at the rate of 10% above the prime rate per annum</UNDER>, for services allegedly provided in relation to the Improvement, despite no invoice for this amount claimed having been received by Lengara prior to the filing of the NGC Lien, and after Mr. Hermano knowingly executed a false statutory declaration [emphasis mine].</P>
<P>20. NGC stands to benefit by its decision not to prosecute its claims.</P>
<P>21. Finally, the limitation period has expired, which in and of itself if a measure of the presence of prejudice.</P>
<P>22. Lengara is likely to be seriously prejudiced by NGC's delay.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><EM>Interests of Justice</EM></TI>
<P>23. In addressing the interests of justice, &ldquo;[o]n a balance of probabilities, is there a compelling reason in this case why the interests of justice would be served by dismissing this application, despite the findings of inordinate delay, inexcusable delay and serious prejudice to the defendant?&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Trak Energy Corporation</EM>, supra</P1></P>
<P>24. NGC claims the sum of $399,417.36, for services allegedly provided in relation to the Improvement. No invoice was ever issued or demand made to Lengara for that sum, prior to the filing of the NGC Lien. When the NGC Lien was filed, the only unpaid invoices NGC had issued totaled $104,684.91. Mr. Hermano, to the knowledge of NGC, knowingly executed a false statutory declaration, and refused to pay the Unpaid Sub-Contracts, and commenced these proceedings.</P>
<P>25. NGC, by its principal Mr. Hermano issuing the false statutory declaration, had caused the very situation giving rise to its claims, and as a result Lengara has suffered loss, costs and damages.</P>
<P>26. NGC has not complied with the July 6, 2012 Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Kelleher to post security in the amount of $20,000, which Lengara submits demanded action forthwith or alternatively within a reasonable period of time.</P>
<P>27. The object of the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>, Rule 1-3(1), is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding on its merits. These proceedings have languished and sat dormant for far too long. NGC has delayed these proceedings, to the prejudice of Lengara. There is a substantial risk that a fair trial is not possible in this case given the delay.</P>
<P>28. Lengara respectfully submits that the interests of justice require that these proceedings be dismissed for want of prosecution and the Letter of Credit returned, with costs payable forthwith to Lengara, pursuant to Rule 14 -1.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, ROBERT WALKER, Businessman, care of #201, 20353 - 64<SUP>th</SUP> Avenue, Langley, B.C. V2Y 1N5, SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a director and the Chief Executive Officer of Defendant Lengara Ventures Inc., (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;) and as such have personal knowledge of the facts and matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except where such information is stated to be on information and belief, and I verily believe that information to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am authorized to swear this Affidavit on behalf of Lengara.</P>
<P>3. Lengara is actively engaged in the business of property development, in conjuncti on with related companies, the &ldquo;No. 1 Collision Group of Companies&rdquo; which operate auto body repair service shops, all of which companies are collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Walker Group of Companies&rdquo;. The Walker Group of Companies are owned and/or controlled by my immediate family members: my father, Gary Walker (&ldquo;Gary&rdquo;), my mother, Helena Walker, my brother, Scott Walker (&ldquo;Scott&rdquo;), and me.</P>
<P>4. Lengara is the owner of lands and premises located at 3410 Lougheed Hwy, Vancouver, British Columbia, legally described as PID 028-116-844, Lot 1 Block 1 Section 38 Township of Hastings Suburban Lands Plan BCP43119 (the &ldquo;Lands&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. I have read the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim filed in these proceedings by the Plaintiff NGC Management Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;), which alleges breach of a written contract between NGC and Lengara, entered into on March 12, 2009, whereby NGC &ldquo;agreed to provide project management services as described in that contract for an improvement being constructed on the Lands (the &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;).&rdquo;</P>
<P>6. The Improvement was/is a commercial building and related improvements to the Lands, from which, since 2010, one of the No. 1 Collision Group of Companies has operated an auto body repair service shop, alongside other arms length businesses.</P>
<P>7. I have read the Statement of Defence filed in these proceedings by Lengara, which, among other things, says that the terms of written contract between NGC and Lengara in respect of the services to be provided by NGC to the Improvement were amended from time to time by further agreements between NGC and Lengara, between March 12, 2009 and December 26, 2009.</P>
<P>8. I have been the Chief Executive Office (&ldquo;CEO&rdquo;) of the Walker Group of Companies, including Lengara, since about 2014, and a director of Lengara since August 2013. Prior to 2014, Gary was the CEO of the Walker Group of Companies, and Gary and my mother were the only directors of Lengara before I became a director in 2013.</P>
<P>9. I was not responsible for dealing with the construction of the Improvement, and was responsible for any of the agreements, or involved any discussions, between Lengara and NGC concerning the Improvement.</P>
<P>10. I am advised by Gary that virtually ail dealings between Lengara and NGC in respect of the construction of the Improvement and any other related matters were between him and Alfredo Hermano, the President of NGC.</P>
<P>11. Gary was the directing mind of Lengara at all times relevant to NGC's claims and is the person most knowledgeable of the subject matter of these proceedings.</P>
<P>12. Gary was born on December 14, 1946. He is 69 years of age.</P>
<P>13. Since about 2014, and continuing to date, Gary has had virtually no role in the management of the Walker Group of Companies, including Lengara. He is effectively retired and it is not anticipated that he will have a role in the management of any of the Walker Group of Companies, including Lengara.</P>
<P>14. The reason for Gary's retirement from the Walker Group of Companies, including Lengara, was advanced age and a decline in his ability to manage the business of the companies. He had increasingly been unable to effectively manage the day-today business of the companies, which management required not only time and effort on a full-time basis, but mental acuity.</P>
<P>15. My brother, Scott, and I made the decision to ask our Father to retire as the CEO of the Walker Group of Companies, in about 2014, based on our observations and interactions with him. We observed that his mental acuity: his memory; focus; concentration; and understanding; is not as it was, and that his ability to properly manage the business of the Walker Group of Companies was no long adequate.</P>
<P>16. As an example of Gary's declining mental acuity, in about May 2015, despite Gary having been present during financing discussions concerning the Walker Group of Companies, when it was time to sign paperwork prepared by the banks lawyers, with our corporate lawyers, Gary could not properly recall the terms of the financing negotiated in his presence, and initially refused to sign the documents. As a result of Gary's misunderstanding, changes had to be made to the documents, and the meeting with our corporate lawyers had to be rescheduled.</P>
<P>17. Lengara deposited an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit, issued by the Canadian Western Bank, dated January 31, 2011, with the Registrar of the Court, as security for the claim of lien registered under number XXXXXXXXXX which was filed by NGC, in substitution for funds Lengara had previously deposited with the Registrar of the Court, in the amount of $323,585.35 (the &ldquo;Letter of Credit&rdquo;).</P>
<P>18. As a term of providing the Letter of Credit, the Canadian Western Bank requires Lengara to keep $323,585.35 in a GIC account with the Canadian Western Bank, as security for the Letter of Credit. Lengara receives nominal interest on funds in this GIC account, currently 0.7% per annum, however its cost of borrowing pursuant to its line of credit is substantially higher.</P>
<P>19. The cost to maintain the Letter of Credit is 1.00% per annum ($3,235.85 annually).</P>
<P>20. I make this affidavit in support of Lengara's application to dismiss these proceedings for want of prosecution.</P>

<P>I, Alfredo Hermano, businessman, c/o Munroe &amp; Company, 2207 - 2850 Shaughnessy Street, in the City of Port Coquitlam, in the Province of British Columbia, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the president of the plaintiff and as such I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters referred to in this affidavit except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. The plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd., is now known as NGC Constructors Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;).</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Cause of Delay</UNDER></TI>
<P>3. The primary reason for delay in the action against Lengara Ventures Inc. (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;) has been a financial setback.</P>
<P>4. NGC is a general contractor. Several of NGC's clients owe NGC a total of approximately three million dollars in connection with various construction projects.</P>
<P>5. As a result of these clients' non-payment, NGC has also had to defend itself against approximately thirty lawsuits by its subtrades, resulting in considerable expense.</P>
<P>6. In the summer of 2011, NGC was forced to undertake a Division 1 Proposal under the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM> to reduce the financial burden of the non-payment and restructure NGC's operations to survive the challenging situation. NGC has almost paid this amount in full.</P>
<P>7. In the fall of 2015, NGC's executive team decided to expand its opportunities, so we opened an office in Toronto, Ontario to hedge against the limited opportunities in British Columbia.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Litigation Financing</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. NGC has always wanted to advance its claim against Lengara in order to collect the amount that Lengara owed to NGC.</P>
<P>9. I understand that the court order dated July 6, 2012 prevents NGC from taking any steps against Lengara until $20,000.00 is paid into court.</P>
<P>10. If the order had not been granted, NGC would have been able to move this lawsuit forward as its funds allowed.</P>
<P>11. I discovered the availability of commercial litigation financing in Canada on October 25, 2016. I have reached out to several commercial litigation financing companies seeking funding for this lawsuit against Lengara.</P>
<P>12. Two of these companies are Bentham IMF International Litigation Funding (&ldquo;Bentham&rdquo;) and BridgePoint Financial Services Inc.</P>
<P>13. NGC has is currently involved in Bentham's due diligence process. I have been informed that Bentham has the ability to fully fund this litigation and, once Bentham agrees to fund the lawsuit, it would guarantee the payment of any costs that NGC is ordered to pay Lengara in this lawsuit. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit A</BOLD> is a copy of a letter from Tania Sulan, Chief Investment Officer of Bentham, addressed to Garrett Munroe and dated January 6, 2017.</P>
<P>14. I expect that Bentham will be able to make a decision regarding whether to fund this lawsuit by February 17, 2017.</P>
<P>15. Even if Bentham is unwilling to fund this litigation, NGC expects to be awarded several large contracts within the next month. These contracts are a result of NGC's expansion into Ontario and will result in significant profit to NGC. NGC will then be able to satisfy the security for costs order and move this lawsuit ahead to ensure a trial at the earliest possible date.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Subcontractor Agreements</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. Lengara has made several false allegations against me and NGC. Lengara has stated that NGC owes money to subcontractors however these subcontractors were hired by Lengara. According to NGC's construction management contract with Lengara, Lengara is responsible for paying these subcontractors. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit B</BOLD> are ten subcontracts which bear Gary Walker's signature and reflect Lengara's commitment to pay for the various subtrades.</P>

<P>9. Attached and marked as Exhibit &ldquo;<BOLD>M</BOLD>&rdquo; to this my Affidavit is a true copy of a printout of Court Order Interests Rates downloaded from the Courts of British Columbia website on January 25, 2017, which sets out the banker's prime rate. Using Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;, I have calculated the average rate of annual interest claimed by NGC in these proceedings as set out in the Statement of Claim (&ldquo;interest at the rate of 10% above the prime rate per annum&rdquo;) for the period from the filing of the Statement of Claim in April 2010 to date to be approximately 12.918%. On the amount of $323,585.35, secured for NGC's claim, this results in a claim for interest of approximately $41,800.00 per annum, or approximately $282,150.00 to date. On the amount claimed in the Statement of Claim, $399,417.36, the annual interest would be approximately $51,596.00, or approximately $348,277.00 to date.</P>

<P>I, Maarten Koorn, businessman, c/o Munroe &amp; Company, 2207 - 2850 Shaughnessy Street, in the City of Port Coquitlam, in the Province of British Columbia, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:
<P1>1. I am the Chief Operating Officer of the plaintiff company and as such I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters referred to in this affidavit except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P1>
<P1>2. The plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd., is now known as NGC Constructors Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>3. I have reviewed Affidavit #2 of Claudine Aguillon.</P1>
<P1>4. NGC has published information relating to several projects to highlight its capacity for business success and future growth plans on the website www.ngc.build. This content is aspirational, promotional information.</P1>
<P1>5. It is common industry practice to engage in online self -promotion to attract further business opportunities.</P1>
<P1>6. It would be unusual and harmful to business to include details of a company's financial challenges on its website.</P1>
<P1>7. It is in part because of NGC's promotional efforts that NGC has very recently obtained a contract for a very large project. This project is many times larger than NGC's contract with Lengara. NGC is currently working on the contract and will make a substantial profit due to this project.</P1>
<P1>8. In response to paragraph 4(b) of Affidavit #2 of Claudine Aguillon, these 13 projects were spread out over a period of approximately 14 years. The value of the projects are rounded up and also includes the Lengara project for which NGC was not paid. Most of these projects had a margin of 2% to 3% so there was little money left over to recover the losses suffered due to Lengara's non-payment and pay for other costs such as overhead and legal expenses.</P1>
<P1>9. Due to the financial pressures largely caused by Lengara's non-payment of money owed to NGC, NGC had to make a Division 1 Proposal to Creditors under the <EM>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</EM> to obtain debt relief without going into bankruptcy.</P1>
<P1>10. NGC's Ontario office is based in Alfredo Hermano's home. There is negligible cost to operate this home office.</P1>
<P1>11. Similarly, NGC's Saskatoon office was only opened because NGC's estimator wanted to move to Saskatoon. He is NGC's only employee in Saskatchewan. The office is a sublease of a small space within an office and costs approximately $500 per mont h.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>NOTICE OF APPLICATION</TI>
<P>Name of Applicant: The Defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc.</P>
<P>To: The Plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd.</P>
<P>TAKE NOTICE that an application will be made by the applicant to the presiding judge at the courthouse at the Law Courts, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver British Columbia on October 24, 2017, at 9:45 a.m, for the orders set out in Part 1 below.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS SOUGHT</TI>
<P>1. An order dismissing the plaintiff's appeal from the decision of Master Muir made July 24, 2017, for failure to comply with the Standard Direction for Appeals from Decisions of Masters, Registrars or Special Referees pursuant to Civil Rule 23-6(8) and Family Rule 22-7(8), PD-54.</P>
<P>2. In the alternative, directions governing the conduct of the plaintiff's appeal from the decision of Master Muir made July 24, 2017.</P>
<P>3. An order dispensing with approval by the plaintiff as to the form of the orders of Master Muir made July 24, 2017, Master Dick made April 5, 2017, and Master Scarth made December 15, 2016.</P>
<P>4. Special costs, payable to the defendant forthwith, in any event of the cause.</P>
<P>5. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. These proceedings concern allegations in respect of the provision of services by the plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd., NGC Constructors Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;), in connection with the construction of a commercial building and related improvements to the lands owned by the defendant, Lengara Ventures Inc., now Walker Group Ventures Inc. (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;), claims of liens, and the execution of a false statutory declaration.</P>
<P>2. NGC commenced these proceedings on April 19, 2010.</P>
<P>3. Security for NGC's claims was paid into Court by Lengara in August 2010, and a letter of credit was deposited with the Registrar, in substitution, in January 2011, pursuant to orders of this Court.</P>
<P>4. On July 6, 2012, Mr. Justice Keileher, on hearing the application of Lengara, among other things, ordered NGC to post security for costs in the amount of $20,000 and stayed the action until security was posted.</P>
<P>5. On July 6, 2017, Master Muir heard the defendant's application to dismiss the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution, for an order that posted security be released, and for costs (the &ldquo;Application to Dismiss&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. On July 24, 2017, Master Muir's Reasons for Judgment were released. Master Muir dismissed the plaintiff's claim and ordered that the letter of credit in the amount of $323,585.35, posted as security for release of the lien registered by the plaintiff against the title to lands owned by the defendant, be returned to the issuing bank, Canadian Western Bank, and allowed the defendant its costs, payable forthwith.</P>
<P>7. NGC filed a Notice of Appeal on August 4, 2017, setting down the hearing of the appeal for October 24, 2017, with an estimate of 2 hours.</P>
<P>8. Counsel for NGC had previously communicated that 1<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> days were required for the hearing of its appeal and counsel for Lengara estimated 2 days; the parties have yet to secure dates for the proper hearing of the appeal.</P>
<P>9. NGC served its Notice of Appeal by facsimile on August 11, 2017, at 4:03PM, advising its Statement of Argument would follow on August 14, 2107.</P>
<P>10. Counsel for Lengara has no record of service of NGC's Statement of Argument, on August 14, 2017, or at all.</P>
<P>11. Counsel for Lengara wrote to counsel for NGC on August 20 and September 11, 2017, concerning NGC's outstanding Statement of Argument and NGC's intentions regarding its appeal, as well concerning the orders of Master Muir, Master Dick and Master Scarth, prepared and sent for approval by counsel for NGC.</P>
<P>12. There has been no response by or on behalf of NGC to the correspondence from counsel for Lengara dated August 29 or September 11, 2017.</P>
<P>13. NGC has not complied with the Standard Direction for Appeals from Decisions of Masters, Registrars or Special Referees pursuant to Civil Rule 23-6(8) and Family Rule 22-7(8), PD-54.</P>
<P>14. No explanation has been offered by or on behalf of NGC for its continuing refusal and/or neglect to approve the terms of the orders of Master Muir made July 24, 2017, Master Dick made April 5, 2017, or Master Scarth made December 14, 2016.</P>
<P>15. No explanation has been offered by or on behalf of NGC for its refusal and/or neglect to comply with the Standard Direction for Appeals from Decisions of Masters, Registrars or Special Referees pursuant to Civil Rule 23-6(8) and Family Rule 22-7(8), PD-54.</P>
<P>16. NGC has a history of inaction, delays and non-compliance in these proceedings.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. Supreme Court Civil Rules, 1-3, 13-1, 14-1, 22-7, and 23-6, and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.</P>
<P>2. Standard Direction for Appeals from Decisions of Masters, Registrars or Special Referees pursuant to Civil Rule 23-6(8) and Family Rule 22-7(8), PD-54.</P>
<P>3. There are a number of authorities from our Court of Appeal which have set out the applicable principles to be considered when exercising discretion on an application to strike a party's pleading, and which have been applied, each case based on its particular facts and discussing relevant factors, including the following:
<P1>a. the party at fault bears the onus of proving a lawful excuse for the non - compliance or non-observance;</P1>
<P1>b. a lawful excuse is one which, in the discretion of the judge acting judicially, is worthy of acceptance; and</P1>
<P1>c. fundamental failures, such as the failure to make appropriate disclosure of documents or records, must be treated as a serious default.</P1>

<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breberin v. Santos</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 560</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>4. There is no doubt that NGC has not complied with the Standard Direction for Appeals from Decisions of Masters, Registrars or Special Referees pursuant to Civil Rule 23-6(8) and Family Rule 22-7(8), PD-54. The only question is whether NGC has a lawful excuse and, if there is not, what the sanction should be.</P></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>APPLICATION RESPONSE</UNDER></TI>
<P><BOLD>Application response of:</BOLD> NGC Management Ltd. (the &ldquo;application respondent&rdquo;)</P>
<P>THIS IS A RESPONSE TO the notice of application of Lengara Ventures Inc., filed 12/Oct/2017.</P>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>1:</N><TI>ORDERS CONSENTED TO</TI>
<P>The application respondent consents to the granting of none of the orders set out in Part 1 of the notice of application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>2:</N><TI>ORDERS OPPOSED</TI>
<P>The application respondent opposes the granting of orders set out in paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 of Part 1 of the notice of application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>3:</N><TI>ORDERS ON WHICH NO POSITION IS TAKEN</TI>
<P>The application respondent takes no position on the granting of the order set out in paragraphs 2 and 5 of Part 1 of the notice of application.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>4:</N><TI>FACTUAL BASIS</TI>
<P>1. At all material times, the application respondent has intended to appeal the decision of Master Muir dated July 24, 2017.</P>
<P>2. A Notice of Appeal was filed on August 4, 2017 on behalf of the application respondent.</P>
<P>3. Through no fault of the application respondent, the application respondent has not yet served its Statement of Argument as counsel for the application respondent has been ill and unable attend to the matter as a result of illness.</P>
<P>4. Counsel for the applicant has advised that he is unavailable for the hearing of the appeal until February 2018.</P>
<P>5. The application respondent is ready, willing, and able to prosecute its appeal in February 2018 in accordance with the applicant's availability. The application respondent therefore submits that there is no prejudice to proceeding with the hearing of the appeal in February 2018 as initially contemplated by the parties.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>5:</N><TI>LEGAL BASIS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>No Failure to Comply with a Direction</UNDER></TI>
<P>6. Rule 22-7(2) states that a proceeding may be set aside, wholly or in part, based on a party's failure to comply with the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>7. Rule 22-7(6) states &ldquo;if a person, without lawful excuse, refuses or neglects to comply with a direction of the court, the court may make an order [to dismiss the proceeding pursuant to Rule 22-7(5)(f)].&rdquo;</P>
<P>8. A practice direction is not a direction of the court. A direction of the court is an order of the court.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breberin v. Santos</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 560</CITE><PARANUM>54</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>9. A practice direction does not have the same force and effect as legislation, regulations, or court order. It is an informational statement published for the guidance and assistance of registry staff.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R v Sharpe</SOC><CITE>1999 BCCA 668</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>10. This interpretation is consistent with the court's reluctance to dismiss a proceeding, and that dismissal &ldquo;is a blunt tool, to be used sparingly&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>House of Sga'nisim v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2007 BCCA 483</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>11. If the legislature had intended to give the time limits imposed by Practice Direction 54 the force of law, the time limits would have been expressly set out in the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>12. If the legislature had intended that Rule 22-7 would apply to practice directions, this would have been expressly set out in the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM>.</P>
<P>13. Striking a pleading for non-compliance for a reason not contemplated in the <EM>Supreme Court Civil Rules</EM> is a draconian remedy. It is a blunt tool to be used sparingly and in only the most egregious of cases because it deprives the litigants of a trial on the evidence.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Homer Estate v. Eurocopter S.A.</SOC><CITE>2003 BCCA 229</CITE></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>House of Sga'nisim v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC><CITE>2007 BCCA 483</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>14. Moreover, a dismissal order should not be granted on a first application for relief arising from procedural delay, even intentional delay. Injustice would result from such a course of action. Lesser sanctions ought to be considered where any are available and appropriate.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Breberin v. Santos</SOC><CITE>2013 BCSC 560</CITE><PARANUM>58&ndash;60</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>There is No Wilful or Intentional Delay</UNDER></TI>
<P>15. Moreover, and in the alternative, even if the application respondent failed to comply with the practice direction, &ldquo;the absence of a lawful excuse is only a necessary precondition to exercise the powers; it does not compel the exercise of the powers, as there is a residual discretion to make or not make the orders sought.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Kondori v. New Country Appliances Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 164</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>16. The court may consider other factors such as prejudice to the applicant, prejudice to the application respondent, the draconian nature of the remedy, and the seriousness of the allegations made in the proceeding.</P>
<P>17. At all material times, the application respondent intended to prosecute its appeal.</P>
<P>18. Through no fault of the application respondent, counsel for the application respondent has been ill and unable to finalise and serve the Statement of Argument.</P>
<P>19. The inability of counsel to carry out finalize and provide the Statement of Argument does not constitute refusal or neglect by the party to prosecute its claim. The failure was due to counsel's medical issues and own inadvertence. His failure was not by wilful or deliberate neglect on his part. More importantly, the application respondent respectfully submits that the failure to finalize and serve the Statement of Argument was not due to wilful or deliberate neglect on its own part.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>No Prejudice</UNDER></TI>
<P>20. In relation to the subject appeal, the Notice of Appeal was filed on August 4, 2017.</P>
<P>21. Counsel for the application respondent received the transcript of the chambers proceedings on or about September 13, 2017.</P>
<P>22. On September 11, 2017, counsel for the applicant advised that he was unavailable for the hearing of the appeal until February 2018.</P>
<P>23. The application respondent is ready, willing, and able to prosecute its appeal in February 2018 in accordance with the applicant's availability. The application respondent therefore submits that there is no prejudice to proceeding with the hearing of the appeal in February 2018 as initially contemplated by the parties.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Special Costs are Not Appropriate</UNDER></TI>
<P>24. Special costs are typically awarded as a punitive measure, as opposed to as an indemnity, where the court seeks to disassociate itself from the conduct of a party to the litigation.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Garcia v. Crestbrook Forest Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1994 CanLII 2570</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>25. There is a single standard for the award of special costs and that is where a party's conduct can be characterised as &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo;. Reprehensible conduct includes, but is not limited to, conduct which is scandalous and outrageous. It also includes milder forms of conduct deserving of reproof or rebuke.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Garcia v. Crestbrook Forest Industries Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1994 CanLII 2570</CITE><COURTJUR>BCCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>26. The illness of an officer of the court is not reprehensible conduct on behalf of the application respondent which is deserving of punishment.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>I, Garrett Munroe, Barrister &amp; Solicitor, c/o Munroe &amp; Company, 2207 - 2850 Shaughnessy Street, in the City of Port Coquitlam, in the Province of British Columbia, AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am counsel for the plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;), and therefore have personal knowledge of the facts and matters referred to in this affidavit except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and, where so stated, I verily believe the same to be true</P>
<P>2. I received the reasons for judgment of Master Muir (the &ldquo;Decision&rdquo;) on July 24, 2017. I understood that at all material times NGC intended to appeal the Decision.</P>
<P>3. At that time shortly after receiving the Decision, our offices ordered a transcript of the chambers hearing and prepared the Notice of Appeal,</P>
<P>4. The Notice of Appeal was filed on August 4, 2017. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Notice of Appeal.</P>
<P>5. Around the time that the Notice of Appeal was filed, I began to feet unwell. My symptoms at that time included migraines and fatigue as well as pain in my chest, abdomen, and joints. I was unable to concentrate on complex tasks while suffering from these symptoms.</P>
<P>6. I have suffered from similar symptoms for over one year; however the onset of those symptoms and their duration have been intermittent and are often unpredictable. I had expected that the symptoms would subside within a few days and that the symptoms would not have a material impact on my ability to prosecute the appeal. Regrettably, those symptoms did not and have not resolved to this date. While I did not fully recover from the symptoms, the symptoms did, at times, attenuate to a degree that caused me to believe that my recovery was progressing and that I would soon be able to attend to this matter.</P>
<P>7. On August 11, 2017, my offices prepared a letter serving the Notice of Appeal. The letter was signed on my behalf and sent to counsel for the defendant. The letter explained that I intended to deliver NGC's Statement of Argument on August 14, 2017. The letter reflected my expectation that I would recover sufficiently to allow me to draft the Statement of Argument over the weekend. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the said letter.</P>
<P>8. Regrettably, I did not recover that weekend as I had hoped and anticipated. I subsequently took leave from my office from August 23, 2017 until August 28, 2017 to focus on recovery from my health condition.</P>
<P>9. I felt better upon returning to the office on August 28, 2017 although it was still difficult for me to focus on and accomplish complex tasks requiring concentration. I remained hopeful that I would be able to recover from my symptoms within a short period of time. In hindsight, this may have been an unrealistic belief. I had, at the time, believed that I was simply experiencing a more frequent than usual series of symptoms. I viewed them as a cluster of unwelcome and uncomfortable events rather than the precursor to a more serious, persistent problem. At thirty-three years old, I did not expect that I would fall victim to a serious or prolonged illness; the possibility that I was experiencing something serious and with a long duration seemed to be remote.</P>
<P>10. Over the ensuing days and weeks, I became increasingly overwhelmed with attending to work-related correspondence and my files. I experienced several days during which I had significant difficulty concentrating. On several days, I sat in the dark in my office with the hope that I would be able to manage my symptoms. I was unable to attend to my files on those days. On other days, I felt better which allowed me to be marginally productive although my concentration was still impacted. As a result of those better days, I led myself to believe that recovery was continuing and likely imminent.</P>
<P>11. During this period in August 2017, I relied heavily upon my staff. However, I was unable to delegate the task of drafting and serving a Statement of Argument for an appeal because none of the members of my firm has the ability or experience to accomplish this task. I delegated some of the research and preliminary efforts; however I had to apply myself to review, revise, and supplement this rough draft.</P>
<P>12. There were, in August 2017, two other solicitors working in my office: Sarah Grewal and Sarah Lavrisa. Ms. Lavrisa was called to the bar on April 28 of this year and Ms. Grewal was called to the bar on May 31 of this year.</P>
<P>13. Ms. Grewal ceased to be a member of our firm on September 8, 2017. At no point did I consider it to be appropriate or helpful for Ms. Grewal to work on the appeal.</P>
<P>14. Ms. Lavrisa assisted me to the best of her abilities; however it was necessary for me to review, revise, and complete her work product prior to its submission.</P>
<P>15. I anticipated that reviewing the work of others would be feasible as it would reduce the amount and duration of the concentration required; however I found myself to be unable to accomplish this task despite numerous attempts.</P>
<P>16. In hindsight, I should have delegated the task to another solicitor at another firm. However, I was unable to complete this process as the concentration required to summarise and transfer the file were beyond me at this point. It seemed to me that pushing ahead and trying to finish the Statement of Argument was the better and more appropriate route to take.</P>
<P>17. Beginning in or around late August, I found it increasingly difficult to read. I believed that the persistent migraines and fatigue were responsible for this difficulty.</P>
<P>18. Towards the latter half of September, I became increasingly troubled by a frequent sensation that there was something present in my left peripheral vision. This became worse and was accompanied by apparent rapid movement as if something was running quickly to my left. I then began to see infrequent flashes of light and black dots.</P>
<P>19. My visual symptoms worsened with looking at documents with a white or bright background. While I could see and make-out words on a page generally, my vision was such that the words appeared blurry and were obscured by distortions. It is difficult to describe these distortions; however, the experience is similar to reading text by looking through a thin, translucent chainmail that is vibrating rapidly. Further, large areas of the page seemed to be divided into circles that have an orange hue and glow with varying intensity. These symptoms are ongoing.</P>
<P>20. While it was and is possible for me to read, <BOLD>I</BOLD> do so with great difficulty, poor accuracy, and low speed. I also experienced aggravation of symptoms, including migraine headaches when I attempt to read or to write for extended periods beyond 15 minutes. As a result, I began to take my health extremely seriously and this became my primary focus.</P>
<P>21. I understand that counsel for the defendant sent correspondence to my office at various points following the filing of the Notice of Appeal. <BOLD>I</BOLD> do not deny that my office received that correspondence. However, as a result of my condition, I was unable to review, understand, and deal with that correspondence in a meaningful way nor was I able to advance the appeal.</P>
<P>22. On or about October 2, 2017, I met with my family doctor, Dr. Leung. He advised me to see an optometrist.</P>
<P>23. On October 5, 2017, I met with Dr. Lloyd Mah, optometrist. He performed a physical examination and retinal imaging. Following his examination, he was concerned that I was experiencing a retinal tear. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Dr. Mah's report.</P>
<P>24. At that time, Dr. Mah referred me to Retina Surgical Associates and his office made an appointment with Dr. Robert Gizicki who was acting as locum for Dr. Leah Wittenberg.</P>
<P>25. On or about October 6, 2017, I met with Dr. Gizicki. There were some issues with dilating my pupils prior to his examination and Dr. Gizicki had trouble conducting a complete examination. Following his examination, Dr. Gizicki ruled out a retinal tear but suspected a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in both eyes. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of Dr. Gizicki's report.</P>
<P>26. I was very concerned about Dr. Gizicki's diagnosis. Through my own research of PVD, I learned that the illness primarily affects the elderly with approximately half of people aged eighty having experienced a PVD. I am thirty-three years old and, as such, a diagnosis of a PVD in a patient of my age is very rare and concerning.</P>
<P>27. I became increasingly concerned that Dr. Gizicki's diagnosis was incorrect when I did not experience any improvement in my symptoms over the next two weeks. I also experienced physical discomfort which was not resolving. I attempted to schedule an appointment with Dr. Leung; however he was unavailable.</P>
<P>28. Instead, on or about October 20, 2017, I met with Dr. Andrew Cheong. Dr. Cheong practices in the same clinic as Dr. Leung. Dr. Cheong referred me to an optometrist and I attended at the optometrist's office immediately following this appointment. I was advised by the optician that they were unable to provide relief for the physical discomfort or provide any assurances beyond confirming that I was not experiencing a retinal detachment. They referred me back to Retina Surgical Associates and advised me to attend an Emergency Room if my vision deteriorated further over the weekend.</P>
<P>29. At the end of my appointment, Dr. Cheong provided me with a copy of Dr. Mah's report. I noticed that Dr. Mah did not find any vitreous cells in his examination. This appeared to me to possibly contradict Dr. Gizicki's diagnosis of a posterior vitreous detachment.</P>
<P>30. On or about October 23, 2017, I made an appointment with another doctor at Dr. Leung's clinic as Dr. Leung was away. The doctor advised me to schedule another appointment. I hoped to resolve the apparent contradiction between Dr. Mah's report and Dr. Gizicki's diagnosis. The doctor advised me to schedule another appointment with Dr. Leung and to contact my ophthalmologist. At that time, I scheduled the first available appointment with Dr. Leung and booked an appointment with Dr. Wittenberg.</P>
<P>31. On or about October 25, 2017, I met with Dr. Leung. He suspected that my visual symptoms included scintillations caused by persistent migraines and exacerbated by poor sleep. He prescribed amitriptyline to assist with sleep and suppress the migraine symptoms.</P>
<P>32. On or about October 26, 2017, I met with Dr. Wittenberg. Following her examination, she concluded that there was no basis for Dr. Gizicki's diagnosis of a PVD but could not offer a conclusion as to the cause of my symptoms. She did not believe that the visual symptoms were scintillations and suspected instead that the symptoms could be caused by a spasming nerve in the back of my head. I do not yet have Dr. Wittenberg's report. I am advised by her office and I verily believe that she is currently away from the office and has not yet prepared her report.</P>
<P>33. As of November 9, 2017, I do not have a conclusive diagnosis nor do I have satisfactory relief from my symptoms despite the treatment protocols recommended by Drs. Leung and Wittenberg.</P>
<P>34. Until Dr. Wittenberg's examination, I was extremely concerned that I would or could lose my eyesight permanently and that my discomfort would persist indefinitely.</P>
<P>35. While I am now less concerned that I will lose my vision due to a disease of or injury to my eyes, I remain perplexed and incredibly concerned as to the possible cause or causes of my symptoms. I do not understand how or why I am experiencing these symptoms. <BOLD>I</BOLD> remain focussed on and committed to my recovery and obtaining a definitive diagnosis.</P>

<P>I, Maarten Koorn, business person and chief operating officer of NGC Management Ltd., 210 - 24 East 4th Avenue, in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am chief operating officer for the plaintiff, NGC Management Ltd. (&ldquo;NGC&rdquo;), and therefore have personal knowledge of the facts and matters referred to in this affidavit except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and, where so stated, I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am authorized by NGC to swear this Affidavit.</P>
<P>3. Shortly after July 24, 2017, I became aware of the reasons for judgment of Master Muir given on July 24, 2017 dismissing the action herein (the &ldquo;Decision&rdquo;). At all material times, NGC intended to pursue an appeal of the Decision. To that end, NGC retained Garrett Munroe to assist with the prosecution of that appeal (the &ldquo;Appeal&rdquo;), and I expected that Appeal to be filed and all necessary steps to be taken.</P>
<P>4. On November 21, 2017, I was surprised to discover for the first time that certain deadlines requiring completion and delivery of a statement of argument had not been met by Mr. Munroe. On this date, I also became aware for the first time that the defendant Lengara Ventures Inc. (&ldquo;Lengara&rdquo;) had brought an application to strike the Appeal, among other orders sought.</P>
<P>5. On November 21, 2017, I also first became aware at that time that Mr. Munroe has been ill for the past few months. Prior to this date, I was not aware of Mr. Munroe's illness nor was I aware of the deadline to deliver the statement of argument relating to the Appeal or that NGC had missed that deadline.</P>
<P>6. Between July and November 2017, I attempted to contact Mr. Munroe on a number of occasions in relation to the Appeal and ancillary matters. I also attempted to schedule appointments to meet with Mr. Munroe on a few occasions but was unable to successfully schedule an appointment with him. I was not aware of any particular cause for concern and so I simply continued to try to schedule a meeting.</P>
<P>7. It has always been and remains NGC's intention to pursue the Appeal. To that end, NGC intends to complete and deliver its statement of argument with the assistance of either Mr. Munroe or new counsel. In the event that Mr. Munroe is unable to assist promptly, NGC intends to retain other counsel to complete and deliver the statement of argument, all of which NGC hopes and expects to have completed within 4 weeks of today's date.</P>
