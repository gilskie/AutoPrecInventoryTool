<PARTY>IN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF EDWARD MARK LEVICK</PARTY>
</PARTYBLOCK>
<COUNSELBLOCK>
<P>Counsel not indicated.</P>
</COUNSELBLOCK>
<FREEFORM>
<P><P1>1. I am Edward Mark Levick, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and I am the former bankrupt in this proceeding.</P1>
<P1>2. I have personal knowledge of the evidence sworn to in this affidavit except where otherwise stated to be based on information and belief.</P1>
<P1>3. I state, in this affidavit, the source of any information that is not based on my own personal knowledge, and I state my belief of the source.</P1>
<P1>4. I am employed as a School Bus Driver with Stock Transportation.</P1>
<P1>5. I had been assessed a tax liability by Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) with respect to transfers of property to me from a limited liability company that had a tax debt.</P1>
<P1>6. On October 31, 2016, I filed a Proposal pursuant to Division I of the Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency Act (&ldquo;BIA&rdquo;), and a copy of same is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>7. At the time I made the Proposal I filed a Form 79, Statement of Affairs, showing my assets and liabilities, and a copy of same is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>8. The monies in my estate derived from an inheritance from the estate of my father.</P1>
<P1>9. CRA voted against my Proposal, and as a consequence I was deemed to be bankrupt. A copy of the CRA voting letter is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and a copy of the Certificate of Assignment is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>10. During the period of my bankruptcy I made all requisite payments required of me.</P1>
<P1>11. I am advised by Francyne Myers, J.D., C.I.R.P., L.I.T. of Allan Marshall &amp; Associates Inc., (&ldquo;my Trustee&rdquo;), and verily believe, that on November 24, 2016, a Notice of Bankruptcy and Impending Automatic Discharge of Bankrupt was sent to my creditors, including CRA. A copy of same is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>12. On August 22, 2017, I was discharged from bankruptcy. A copy the Form 84, Certificate of Discharge, is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>13. I am advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that Francyne Myers telephoned CRA on September 11, 2017, to inquire about CRA filing a proof of claim in my bankruptcy. I am further advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that CRA indicated that they would not be filing a proof of claim as the personal income tax liability was very small and the bulk owed related to a corporate debt.</P1>
<P1>14. I am advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that CRA did not file a proof of claim in my bankruptcy.</P1>
<P1>15. I am further advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that on November 16, 2017, my Trustee forwarded to CRA a Notice Requiring Person to Prove Claim pursuant to section 149 of the BIA. A copy of same is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>16. I am further advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that CRA did not file a proof of claim, and that on the expiry of the 30 day notice period my Trustee proceeded to declare a final dividend in my estate. Attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo; is a copy of the Form 12, Final Statement of Receipts and Disbursements, filed by my Trustee on December 19, 2017.</P1>
<P1>17. I am further advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that upon my Trustee filing the Final Statement of Receipts and Disbursements with the Office of the Super intendent of Bankruptcy (&ldquo;OSB&rdquo;), the OSB queried why a dividend had not been declared in favour of CRA.</P1>
<P1>18. I am further advised by my Trustee, and verily believe, that on January 9, 2018, CRA filed a proof of claim, a copy of which is attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</P1>
<P1>19. I advised my Trustee that I objected to the late filing of the CRA proof of claim, and on April 18, 2018, my Trustee wrote to the Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy setting out the circumstances and timelines as averred to in this my Affidavit. Attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo; is a copy of that letter.</P1></P>

<PARTY>In the matter of the Bankruptcy of Edward Mark Levick</PARTY>
</PARTYBLOCK>
<COUNSELBLOCK>
<P>Counsel not indicated.</P>
</COUNSELBLOCK>
<FREEFORM>
<P>I, Ryan DeMerchant, of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, make oath and say that:</P>
<P>1. I am employed as a Resource Officer/Complex Case Officer at the Nova Scotia Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;), located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As such, I have personal knowledge of the matters to which I depose in this affidavit. Where I do not have personal knowledge, I have stated the source of my information and in all such cases believe it to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am authorized to make this affidavit on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada as represented by the Minister of National Revenue (&ldquo;Minister&rdquo;), as I have charge of the records of the Minister in relation to the bankruptcy of Edward Mark Levick (&ldquo;Levick&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. With respect to the information provided in this affidavit, I have informed myself from books or records maintained by CRA and where I have done so, I believe that the books or records formed part of and were made in the usual and ordinary course of the operations of CRA and that any copies of the books or records attached as exhibits to this affidavit are true copies thereof.</P>
<P>4. Levick was the sole shareholder of EI-AI Realty Company Limited (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. On January 6, 2016, CRA issued an assessment pursuant to section 160 of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> holding Levick liable for the outstanding corporate income tax debt of the Company in the amount of $161,393.25 (&ldquo;Assessment&rdquo;). Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Assessment.</P>
<P>6. The CRA has no record of an objection having been filed with the Minister nor any record of an appeal having been filed with the Tax Court in relation to the Assessment.</P>
<P>7. On November 21, 2016, CRA filed a proof of claim in the amount of $161,477.56 in the November 3, 2016 proposal made by Levick. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the proof of claim filed in the proposal.</P>
<P>8. On November 21, 2016, CRA voted against the November 3, 2016 Levick proposal by voting letter (included in Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;).</P>
<P>9. On or about November 24, 2016, a notice of bankruptcy was received by CRA in relation to Levick.</P>
<P>10. The Levick bankruptcy was not assigned to an insolvency officer at the time the notice of bankruptcy was received as the amount of his personal income tax debt was minimal.</P>
<P>11. The Assessment was a third party assessment of Levick in relation to the tax debt incurred by the Company on its corporate tax account.</P>
<P>12. It is the usual business practice of CRA to issue a third party assessment from the account of the primary debtor and to make a note on the account of the third party referencing the primary debt assessment. The note on the third party account is not readily apparent upon a cursory review of the account.</P>
<P>13. The Assessment was issued from the account of the Company and a note referencing the underlying debt of the Company was made on Levick's account.</P>
<P>14. I have reviewed an electronic diary entry made on the Levick account by Ingrid Mooy, a Collections Contact Officer in the insolvency unit at CRA, and do verily believe that on or about September 11, 2017, she was contacted by telephone by Allan Marshall &amp; Associates Inc. (&ldquo;Diary Entry&rdquo;). Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Diary Entry as recorded in the electronic records of CRA.</P>
<P>15. The Diary Entry records and I do verily believe that the Trustee was advised that no proof of claim would be issued due the minimal balance of $642.06 owing on Levick's account.</P>
<P>16. On September 25, 2017, the balance of the outstanding corporate tax account of the Company was segregated as uncollectible by the collections unit at CRA. Segregating a debt as uncollectible is an internal administrative mechanism used by CRA that does not affect the validity of the tax assessment or the ability of CRA to reinstate the debt for collection.</P>
<P>17. It is my understanding and belief that the Levick account was not assigned to an insolvency officer at CRA based on the incomplete information regarding Levick's total tax liability and the inadvertent oversight of the amount of the Assessment.</P>
<P>18. On November 17, 2017, a Notice Requiring Person to Prove Claim (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) in relation to the Levick bankruptcy was received by CRA by fax at the Insolvency Intake Centre located in Surrey, British Columbia. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the Notice.</P>
<P>19. The Notice was not scanned and uploaded to CRA's national document filing service until December 8, 2017. A note was made on the Levick account indicating the Notice had been scanned, however, there was no officer assigned to the account.</P>
<P>20. On January 5, 2018, I received an e-mail from Jennifer Gardner, a Bankruptcy Analyst at the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (&ldquo;OSB&rdquo;), inquiring whether CRA had filed a proof of claim when Levick's proposal was rejected. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the e-mail.</P>
<P>21. I was out of the office for the holidays and did not return until January 8, 2018 at which time I reviewed the e-mail from the OSB (Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;).</P>
<P>22. On January 9, 2018, after having reviewed the Levick account and the Company account, I filed by fax a proof of claim on behalf of CRA in the amount of $161,543.75. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the proof of claim (&ldquo;CRA Claim&rdquo;).</P>
<P>23. The Trustee has not requested any additional documents or information in support of CRA?s claim in the Levick bankruptcy.</P>
<P>24. On or about June 28, 2018, I was advised by the OSB and I do verily believe that, following receipt of the CRA Claim, Allan Marshall &amp; Associates Inc. filed an amended Statement of Receipts and Disbursements which provided for the issuance of a dividend to CRA. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of a letter dated January 23, 2018 from the OSB with the amended Statement of Receipts and Disbursements dated January 16, 2018.</P>
<P>25. I make this affidavit in support of CRA's opposition to relief sought in the motion for directions filed by Levick in this matter, and for no other or improper purpose.</P>
