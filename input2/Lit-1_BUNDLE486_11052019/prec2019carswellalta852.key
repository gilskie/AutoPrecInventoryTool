<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The Alberta Assessors' Association (the &ldquo;Association&rdquo;) submits that the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, clearly discloses that Ms. Young copied large sections of her demonstration report from Ms. Rookes, and Ms. Skolney copied large sections of her demonstration report from Mr. Bubula.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">USE OF THE ITHENTICATE SOFTWARE TO IDENTIFY COPYING</TI>
<P>2. The Association submits that it was reasonable to utilize text matching software to assist in the initial screening of the archived demonstration reports. It was also reasonable to reach out to the Association's business partner, the University of British Columbia, for assistance selecting the software and learning about whether the University used filters to screen for common terms.</P>
<P>3. Ms. Hodge received the standard training offered by the software company, and there is no evidence that she misunderstood how to use the software or that the software made errors matching text. The Association submits Ms. Hodge's testimony was clear and understandable, and her recollection of the steps she took was credible.</P>
<P>4. The Association submits that the iThenticate review is only relevant to demonstrating the process by which the Practice Review Committee reviewed archived demonstration reports. The actual results of the iThenticate review are unnecessary to examine in detail for the Court to conclude that copying or plagiarism occurred. As Jeff McKinnon indicated in his testimony, the iThenticate reports were only part of the analysis&mdash;complaints were not laid until the Practice Review Committee members, who were tasked with conducting the review, did a side-by-side comparison of each report against the report identified by the software as having the closest match. The Association submits that, in the case of both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, a side-by-side comparison against respectively, Ms. Rookes' and Mr. Bubula's reports, clearly shows a high level of similarity in sections of text that are intended to reflect the student's own work.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">THE USE OF THE CERTIFICATION DATE TO CREATE THE DATABASE WAS REASONABLE</TI>
<P>5. The archived demonstration reports were loaded into the database in the order of the dates they were certified by the student, as shown on the last page of each demonstration report under the &ldquo;Certification&rdquo; heading. This date was used as a proxy for the date of submission to UBC and the completion of the report. There was an attempt to cast doubt on those dates during Ms. Hodge's cross examination, but later the evidence of Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney confirmed that by the time of the certification date, all of the substantive content of the demonstration was complete, and shortly thereafter was submitted to UBC for marking. This evidence, coupled with the structure of the BUSI 499 Workbook, makes it clear that assignments are done sequentially, with the last assignment including compiling all of the assignments into one report and signing the certification page. Accordingly, it was reasonable for the Association to build the database using the certification date as a proxy for the date submitted to UBC. It is also reasonable to infer that demonstration reports with later certification dates were completed later than reports with earlier certification dates, and if two reports are identified as having a high degree of similarity suggesting copying, the source would, on a balance of probabilities, be the report with the earlier certification date. No evidence has been adduced to suggest that the certification date cannot be relied on in this fashion.</P>
<P>6. Since the archived demonstration reports were loaded into the database in chronological order, this meant that when the software was run for each demonstration report, the report was compared against those reports which had been completed prior. As Ms. Hodge testified, the addenda were not included, so as to filter out common material. The addenda are not expected to be the student's own work and contain documents like certificates of title, excerpts from the Land Use Bylaw or maps of the City of Edmonton. In addition, the Association used a filter to exclude five word strings; this meant that common phrases found in headings would not contribute to the percentage of matching text in the iThenticate reports (Volume 4, Tabs 36 and 39). Mr. McKinnon testified that the Practice Review Committee expected that each demonstration report would have identical headings and sub-headings, and these similarities were not considered problematic in their review. Common headings and subheadings are also prescribed in the BUSI workbook, confirming that it can be reasonably expected that these will be consistent between different demonstration reports.</P>
<P>7. The Association submits this process was reasonable given how the BUSI 499 Workbook is organized, and shows that the Association put its mind to utilizing the software to hone in on the areas of matching text which are expected to be the student's own narrative. Using the Certification Date of each demonstration report as a proxy for when that report was completed is reasonable, given the uncontroverted evidence which shows that the substantive demonstration report will be completed by the time the student prepares the Certification page in the BUSI workbook.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">THE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO DISCLOSURE REQUESTS</TI>
<P>8. The Association has been responsive to disclosure requests from Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney regarding the use of the iThenticate software. Information was first provided to Jenkins and Jenkins in the fall of 2014; see for example the screen shots of all of the demonstration reports (Volume 1, Tab 35). See also the documents found at Tab 23 of the Certified Record of Proceedings for Ms. Young, and the documents found at Tab 12 of the Certified Record of Proceedings for Ms. Skolney.</P>
<P>9. More recently at the pre-trial conference in January 2019, counsel for Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney made the statement that it was her client's belief that there were many other people who had matching percentages from iThenticate that were over 40%, and that complaints were not laid against these individuals. This was an argument which had not previously been made before the Discipline Committee or the Executive Committee (please see the decisions of the Discipline Committee at Volume 9, Tabs 46 and 48 (and 49), and the decisions of the Executive Committee at Volume 9, Tabs 47 and 50).</P>
<P>10. In response, the Association provided the spreadsheet found at Volume 9, Tab 53, which Mr. McKinnon gave evidence about. This was in addition to testimony previously disclosed in September 2018, and the evidence given before the Discipline Committee hearings, that the iThenticate screenshot document, Volume 1, Tab 35, showed the percentage of matching text to all demonstration reports previously certified, whereas the individual iThenticate reports found at Volume 4, Tabs 36 and 39 show percentages of matching text as compared to each report previously in the database. The Applicants did not pursue this argument at trial. In any event, the spreadsheet created by Jeff McKinnon shows that the Practice Review Committee filed complaints against all members whose reports showed a greater than 40% similarity to another report in the database, following their manual review of those reports. The process followed by the Practice Review Committee was fair in determining which reports merited complaints being filed with the Discipline Committee.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">HOW WAS ITHENTICATE USED BY THE PRACTICE REVIEW COMMITTEE?</TI>
<P>11. Simply put, the iThenticate information helped the four members of the Practice Review Committee who completed the manual review of the archived demonstration reports, focus on particular demonstration reports with higher matching percentages, and then within a demonstration report it helped them find the matching text so that it could be evaluated.</P>
<P>12. Mr. McKinnon's evidence was that the four members of the Practice Review Committee were most concerned about Part II of the demonstration reports, which was to contain the student's explanation of the valuation concepts and the application of those concepts in examples and by application to the property which was the subject of the demonstration report. Mr. McKinnon testified that the entire report is to be the student's own work, but that the areas of most concern were the analysis sections.</P>
<P>13. Complaints were not laid solely on the basis of the iThenticate software results, they were laid after the four members of the Practice Review Committee completed the manual review, met to discuss their concerns and jointly decided to lay complaints.</P>
<P>14. The Association submits that the manual review of the archived demonstration reports was very thorough. The four members of the Practice Review Committee did a side-by-side comparison of the narrative, and excluded areas such as a formula or headings, which would be expected to be the same amongst the students. The four members of the Practice Review Committee also checked the data reported by obtaining certificates of title, etc. This checking also revealed common errors which were copied from one report to the other.</P>
<P>15. There is no suggestion that the iThenticate program mis-identified text, that the program didn't work, or that Ms. Hodge made errors. No examples of mis-identified text were ever put to either Ms. Hodge or Mr. McKinnon. Accordingly, Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney had to have copied from a report in the database. Based on the certification dates, the Association submits the only possible inference is that Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes and Ms. Skolney from Mr. Bubula. The preponderance of evidence about the type of copying, the volume of copying and the typos, grammatical errors and mathematical errors, cannot be denied or explained away, as described in greater detail below.</P>
<P>16. The Association submits that the review by the four members of the Practice Review Committee was so thorough, that standing alone, even without considering the iThenticate matching percentages, this Court can conclude that Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes and Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">EVIDENCE AGAINST MS. YOUNG</TI>
<P>17. The certification date on Ms. Rookes' report was March 27, 2009, and the certification date on Ms. Young's report was two years later on April 20, 2011. Ms. Young testified that there was a shared drive at the City of Edmonton which staff had access to, providing an opportunity for copying.</P>
<P>18. All areas of matching text were identified in Schedule A to the Complaint form (Volume 1, Tab 42). Mr. McKinnon did not review every instance of matching text in his testimony; he focused on the large blocks of matching text where the student was expected to write their own narrative to explain their understanding of one of the valuation concepts and provide their own example, or describe that concept's application to the subject property. There were several instances of pages of matching text, including the conclusion to the demonstration report, the Reconciliation section.</P>
<P>19. The Association submits that the common grammatical errors and typos are also very telling. It does not seem likely that two students, working separately and two years apart, would make the exact same errors in sections of the demonstration report that are intended to reflect their own work, as summarized below:
<ITEM><P>at page 53 of Ms. Young's demonstration report (Volume 2, Tab 24) in the second paragraph we find the sentence: &ldquo;The subject site <BOLD>slops</BOLD> slightly downward on all sides, ...&rdquo; [emphasis added] [page 49 of Ms. Rookes' report, Volume 5, Tab 37]. In cross-examination, Ms. Young acknowledged that this paragraph is intended to describe her particular subject property, and she could not account for why she described her subject property using the exact same words, and the exact same typos, as Ms. Rookes;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>at page 83 of Ms. Young's demonstration report, in the second paragraph we find the sentence: &ldquo;The following are two major <BOLD>test</BOLD> of curability of ...&rdquo; [emphasis added] [Ms. Rookes' Report page 76];</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>at page 83 in the second paragraph, second bullet point in the second line, there is an extra space between the words &ldquo;greater&rdquo; and &ldquo;than&rdquo; [Ms. Rookes' Report page 76];</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>at page 83 the last sentence under the heading Deficiency Requiring Addition, the word &ldquo;an&rdquo; is missing in the sentence: &ldquo;The excess cost to cure ... to add an item <BOLD>to existing</BOLD> building than to a new building.&rdquo; [emphasis added] [Ms. Rookes' Report page 77];</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>at page 110 in the second last paragraph on the page, both Ms. Young and Ms. Rookes incorrectly referred to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation [Ms. Rookes' Report page 106]; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>at page 127 of Ms. Young's report under the heading Income Approach, the second last sentence contains two grammatical errors: &ldquo;The subject's expenses were then stabilized by analyzing the comparable <BOLD>sales'</BOLD> income and <BOLD>expenses</BOLD> statements, ...&rdquo; [emphasis added] [Ms. Rookes' report, page 126].</P></ITEM></P>
<P>20. Ms. Rookes was also questioned about her assignments, and she acknowledged that the matching text and errors also appear in the assignments, with the exception of a couple of paragraphs added in response to her tutor's instructions. She also acknowledged that, prior to making some modifications to certain sections of her assignments at her instructor's direction, the assignments were identical to Ms. Rookes' report (see, for example, the email at Vol. 11, Tab 78 as compared against the Assignment at Tab 91, page 6, and Ms. Rookes' report at page 78, and Ms. Young's report at page 84).</P>
<P>21. Mr. McKinnon also testified about Volume 6, Tab 38, which is a demonstration report which had a low matching percentage. This report was chosen simply because it is the same type of property, a walk up apartment building. The location and neighbourhood are not relevant as these parts of the demonstration reports were not of concern to the four members of the Practice Review Committee.</P>
<P>22. This document was offered to show that it is possible, and indeed another student was able to explain their understanding of the course content and concepts in their own words. Mr. McKinnon testified that the 4 members of the Practice Review Committee expected to find differences in the narrative as between demonstration reports&mdash;even in the same section. Mr. McKinnon testified that they did find differences in the narrative, but not in the reports of Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney.</P>
<P>23. The matching text between Ms. Young's report and Ms. Rookes' report is not sporadic. There are pages of matching text between the two demonstration reports. The matching text is not just similar; in many cases, it is exact. The matching text looks like it has been copied and pasted from an electronic copy because of the volume of errors and typos common between the two reports.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VII">EXPLANATIONS OFFERED BY MS. YOUNG</TI>
<P>24. Ms. Young offered eight reasons for the matching text and matching errors, which we will address below:
<P1>(i) In her direct testimony Ms. Young denied copying from Ms. Rookes or anyone else. She was specifically asked in cross examination whether she copied from Ms. Rookes, and she denied, and she was specifically asked whether she copied from any other student's demonstration report, and she denied doing so. When asked how she accounted for the matching text and matching errors, she said she had no explanation. Given this testimony, the Association submits that it is not an available inference that Ms. Young copied from someone else because her testimony is that she copied from no one. Her evidence is simply not believable given the large sections of text which are identical as between her demonstration report, and Ms. Rookes'. The Association submits that the only possible inference to be drawn is that Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes.</P1>
<P1>(ii) In her direct testimony, Ms. Young explained that in her view, an appraisal is different than mass appraisal which is what assessors do in their day to day work. The Association submits that this point is not relevant. Preparing a complete narrative demonstration appraisal report is an important step in the Association's accreditation process. The BUSI 499 Workbook is unequivocal that the narrative is to be the student's own work, and uses the terms copying and plagiarism interchangeably. The instructions for each assignment confirm that the student is to present their own work. The BUSI Workbook does not provide &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; templates to be inserted into demonstration reports, with particular calculations and values to be filled in. Moreover, the Association's Demonstration Report Marking Form (Volume 1, Tab 21) requires the candidate member to confirm that the report is their own work.</P1>
<P1>(iii) Ms. Young testified that she submitted her demonstration report for marking before she had received the marking for assignments #14, #15, #16 and #17, and inferred that somehow this might account for the matching text. The Association notes that the same copying and errors existed in the assignments, leading to the inference that Ms. Young began copying as she submitted her assignments.</P1>
<P1>(iv) Ms. Young testified that her tutor told her &ldquo;you can copy this&rdquo;. She gave an example from the Workbook referring to a table with a formula, and a particular email from her tutor shown at Vol. 11, Tab 78, wherein her tutor confirmed she could copy some discrete information about the calculations for superadequacy. Mr. McKinnon testified about common formulas, and he stated that the four members of the Practice Review Committee were not concerned about common formulas. Ms. Young failed to point to sections of the Workbook which would account for the sheer volume of matching text. In addition, it is not credible to infer that Ms. Young's tutor gave her carte blanche to copy whatever she'd like from the Workbook, in the face of the repeated instructions found in the Workbook that the narrative is to be the students own work. The emails adduced as evidence at trial do not show that Ms. Young's tutor acknowledged or permitted high levels of copying from other sources, and he was not called to give evidence at this trial to that effect. Ms. Young's assertion that her tutor authorized her to copy large amounts of material is inadmissible hearsay, and is not believable or plausible.</P1>
<P1>(v) Mr. McKinnon pointed out two examples used by Ms. Young to illustrate the application of particular assessment concepts, wherein the same examples and same text are found in Ms. Rookes' report (see, for example, pages 84&ndash;86 of Ms. Young's Report as compared against pages 78&ndash;80 of Ms. Rookes' report). In her direct testimony, Ms. Young explained this commonality by saying that the subject property had both a boiler and a hot water tank, and she pointed to a hand drawn floor plan in the appendix as proof. However, on cross examination, Ms. Young confirmed that the example was meant to be an example, not a discussion of the subject property. Mr. McKinnon testified that listing both a boiler and a hot water tank as items that had to be installed to cure problems with a building's heating system did not make sense, and the fact this same error is made in both reports suggests Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes. Similarly, Ms. Young testified that she came up with the example of a superadequacy of a 500 square foot boardroom in an apartment building, but she had no explanation for why her example was phrased in exactly the same manner as Ms. Rookes' report. Again, the Association submits the only plausible inference is that Ms. Young copied this section from Ms. Rookes' report.</P1>
<P1>(vi) Ms. Young indicated that students were referred to the Canadian Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, or CUSPAP, the inference being that the CUSPAP document could account for the matching text. Ms. Young did not introduce the CUSPAP document into evidence to show which sections she copied from, so this theory advanced by Ms. Young should be given no weight. Further, the Association submits this cannot account for the high level of similarity in sections which are intended to describe the particular subject property, or demonstrate knowledge of appraisal concepts which generally would not be seen in standard industry reports.</P1>
<P1>(vii) Ms. Young testified that she re-sent the final assignment to UBC and indicated that the documents behind Tab 102 were the corrected documents. Tab 102 contains a cover page, letter of transmittal, scope, etc. However, she confirmed in cross examination that none of these documents at Tab 102 were of concern to the four members of the Practice Review Committee. This explanation does not explain the matching text in sections which were of concern to the Practice Review Committee.</P1>
<P1>(viii) Ms. Rookes testified at trial, and the Association submits that her testimony was not credible because she largely couldn't recall events, she was not forthcoming, and because of her own finding of unprofessional conduct for copying in her own demonstration report. The Association submits that Ms. Rookes' testimony should be given no weight.</P1></P>
<P>25. The Association submits that none of the explanations offered by Ms. Young can account for the large amount of matching text, the typos, and errors. The Court is left with Ms. Young's denial as compared to the side by side comparison of the demonstration reports, and we submit it is more likely than not, that Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes. In addition to the specific sections referenced above, and in Mr. McKinnon's testimony, the Association refers the Court to Schedule A of the Complaint Form filed by the Practice Review Committee against Ms. Young which shows all of the sections of her report which showed a high degree of similarity as compared to Ms. Rookes' report.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VIII">EVIDENCE AGAINST MS. SKOLNEY</TI>
<P>26. The certification date of Mr. Bubula's report (Volume 7, Tab 40) was March 23, 2011, and the certification date of Ms. Skolney's report (Volume 3, Tab 30) was August 21, 2012. Mr. Bubula worked at the City of Edmonton beginning sometime in 2009 or 2010, and Ms. Skolney confirmed the existence of the shared drive at the City. Ms. Skolney confirmed that she started her UBC course in September 2010, and that she first handwrote her assignments before typing them. She did not have a specific recollection of when she handwrote her assignments except to say that it was between 2010 and 2011. Similarly, Ms. Skolney was unable to recall when she typed her assignments. She testified that some of her assignments were put on the shared drive, but she did not know which ones. She confirmed in cross-examination that the typed assignments transcribed, word-for-word, the text in the handwritten assignments. The evidence also shows that the text of her assignments match the text in her final demonstration report, which matches equivalent text found in Mr. Bubula's report. Given this, the only possible inference that can be drawn is that Ms. Skolney began copying her assignments from Mr. Bubula when she handwrote them in 2010 and 2011. At that time, Mr. Bubula would have been completing his report, but he would not have had access to Ms. Skolney's handwritten assignments, and so he could not have copied from her.</P>
<P>27. In Mr. McKinnon's testimony, he identified several areas of Ms. Skolney's report which the Practice Review Committee felt were particularly problematic:
<P1>(i) When comparing page 23 of the handwritten assignments (Tab 131) against the typed assignment at page 15 of Tab 132, it shows that the handwritten assignment did not contain the same error with respect to the date range of the chart reported in the assignment. However, when compared against Ms. Skolney's demonstration report at page 23 against Mr. Bubula's report at page 30, it shows that the same error was made by Mr. Bubula, and was carried forward from Ms. SKolney's typed assignment to her final demonstration report. In isolation, this single common error would likely not be of concern, but in context with other significant commonalities between Ms. Skolney's report and Mr. Bubula's, the likely reason for this common error is that Ms. Skolney was copying from Mr. Bubula's demonstration report at the time she created the handwritten assignment, realized an error was present, but then reverted to make the same error when the electronic version was created.</P1>
<P1>(ii) When comparing page 58 of Ms. Skolney's demonstration report against page 77 of Mr. Bubula's report, Mr. McKinnon testified that the maps on both reports incorrectly identified the parcel which was sold in the same manner (see the screenshot from SPIN at Tab 58), and further, both reports failed to recognize that the sale described involved more than one parcel. Ms. Skolney testified that she was told by her tutor to not report the fact that multiple parcels were involved in that sale. Ms. Skolney's tutor did not give evidence on this, and Ms. Skolney's evidence on this point is inadmissible hearsay. Further, Ms. Skolney had no explanation for why both she and Mr. Bubula identified the same, incorrect, parcel on their maps. The Association submits that the most plausible explanation is that Ms. Skolney copied this example from Mr. Bubula's report, errors and all.</P1>
<P1>(iii) When comparing pages 77&ndash;80 of Ms. Skolney's report against pages 99&ndash;102 of Mr. Bubula's demonstration report, the text on these pages are identical, and Ms. Skolney provides the same hypothetical example of a heating system (page 80) using almost the exact same words as Mr. Bubula's example (page 102). While other hypothetical examples provided in these pages are different as between the two reports, the text describing the concepts and how they should be applied is nearly identical.</P1>
<P1>(iv) When comparing the chart labelled: &ldquo;Analysis of Re-Sold Properties&rdquo; on page 100 of Ms. Skolney's report, and page 123 of Mr. Bubula's report, Mr. McKinnon testified that a review of land titles records of these sales show that both reports made the same error in reversing the sales prices for Re-Sale #1 and Re-Sale #2. Mr. McKinnon testified that it was not concerning to the Practice Review Committee that the same comparables were used given the similarities between the two subject properties, but the fact the same error was made in both suggests Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula's report. This is further confirmed when comparing these charts against the document introduced as Exhibit 12 at trial, which was a handwritten version of this chart. In the handwritten version, Ms. Skolney did not make the same error, but that version did show that the third comparable property showed sales data being reversed. By the time the electronic version was created, Ms. Skolney's chart exactly matched Mr. Bubula's including correcting the sales data in Re-Sale #3, and retaining the errors made in Re-Sale #1 and Re-Sale #2. In the circumstances, the Association submits the only possible inference is that Ms. Skolney had copied her data from Mr. Bubula, realized at some point that errors had been made, but failed to rectify all of those errors in her typed assignment and final demonstration report. Further, the text below these charts in both reports is almost word-for-word identical, despite the fact the text is intended to describe conclusions reached from the data, and apply that data to the particular subject property. No compelling explanation was given for how two students could independently use the exact same words to analyze the same set of data and apply it to different, albeit similar, subject properties.</P1>
<P1>(v) When comparing pages 117-118 of Ms. Skolney's report against pages 146-147 of Mr. Bubula's report, both reports use nearly identical language to describe the process by which the vacancy and collection loss of the property was determined. This includes citing Avison Young as a common source, as well as referencing specific discussions with Midwest Property Management and Strategic Management. Given the high level of similarity between these sections, and the fact these sections are intended to analyze and apply a particular appraisal concept to the subject property, Mr. McKinnon testified that it appeared Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula's report.</P1>
<P1>(vi) Generally, the conclusions in both Ms. Skolney's and Mr. Bubula's reports use identical language to describe the conclusions reached on the applications of different appraisal principles to the subject property. No plausible explanation was given for the significant amounts of matching text in the conclusions to these reports.</P1></P>
<P>28. In addition to the sections summarized above, we note that other sections of Ms. Skolney's report (as identified at Schedule A of her Complaint Form) are almost identical to Mr. Bubula's report. In cross-examination, Ms. Skolney acknowledged that the section on &ldquo;Economic Background&rdquo; that appears in her handwritten assignments at Tab 131 is almost identical to the equivalent section shown at pages 8-9 of her demonstration report, and pages 8-9 of Mr. Bubula's report. Mr. McKinnon testified that the Practice Review Committee was not particularly concerned about the earlier sections of the demonstration report, including this one. However, the Association submits that the level of similarity in this early section of Ms. Skolney's handwritten assignments, taken in context with the large amount of similar text evidenced elsewhere in her report, demonstrates that she began copying from Mr. Bubula's assignments or demonstration report early on, when she was handwriting her assignments. Had this been the only section of similar text between the two reports, it is unlikely the reports would have been flagged as a significant concern by the Practice Review Committee. However, interpreted in context, the Association submits that the only plausible inference to account for this matching text is that it was also copied from Mr. Bubula's work.</P>
<P>29. There is no evidence that Ms. Skolney's handwritten assignments were scanned and stored to the shared drive, and there was no argument advanced that Mr. Bubula copied from Ms. Skolney. The more likely inference is that Ms. Skolney began by handwriting her assignments in 2010-2011, and then began typing them over the fall of 2011 and into 2012. By the time she began typing assignments, Mr. Bubula's report had already been completed, based on its Certification date. It is therefore not possible that Mr. Bubula copied from Ms. Skolney's report&mdash;rather, the more plausible inference on a balance of probabilities is that Ms. Skolney began copying from Mr. Bubula in late 2010 to early 2011 when she handwrote her assignments, and this copying continued into the electronic versions of the assignments that were submitted over the fall of 2011 and into 2012.</P>
<P>30. Ms. Skolney confirmed that the assignments were done in sequential order. Assignment #11 was sent to UBC by email on January 10, 2012 (Tab 113), which was well after the certification date for Mr. Bubula's report. On January 10, 2012, there were still many assignments to be prepared leading up to the conclusion in Assignment #17, the final reconciliation of value. The conclusion of Ms. Skolney's demonstration report was identical to Mr. Bubula's, and Ms. Skolney certified that the report was complete on August 21, 2012. The Association submits that the best evidence of when Ms. Skolney completed her assignments are the series of emails sending her assignments to UBC found after Tab 113. All of her electronic assignments which comprised the demonstration report were submitted for marking to UBC after Mr. Bubula's report was already completed.</P>
<P>31. Mr. McKinnon gave evidence in relation to the low matching demonstration report Volume 8, Tab 41. The purpose of this testimony, as explained by Mr. McKinnon, was to provide an example of how another student managed to explain the common concepts using a different narrative.</P>
<P>32. This demonstration report example was first provided to Ms. Skolney in advance of the Discipline Committee's hearing. As it turned out, the name of the author was not redacted on one of the pages, and appeared to have a certification date after that of Ms. Skolney. The Association submits that the certification date is not pertinent, as Tab 41 was provided to demonstrate the approach taken by another student.</P>
<P>33. It is not reasonable to conclude that Ms. Skolney and Mr. Bubula could independently write the same matching text, paragraph after paragraph. Nor is it reasonable to conclude that two people working independently could use the same grammar and make the same errors. The most reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence before this Court is that Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IX">EXPLANTIONS OFFERED BY MS. SKOLNEY</TI>
<P>34. Ms. Skolney offered 11 reasons to account for the matching text, typos and errors, some of which were the same as the reasons offered by Ms. Young:
<P1>(i) The first reason was that appraisals are different than mass appraisal. The Association submits that this point is not relevant. Preparing a complete narrative demonstration appraisal report is an important step in the Association's accreditation process. The BUSI 499 Workbook is unequivocal that the narrative is to be the student's own work, and uses the terms copying and plagiarism interchangeably. Moreover, the Association's Demonstration Report Marking Form (Volume 1, Tab 27) requires the candidate member to confirm that the report is their own work. Evidence given by Mr. McKinnon confirms that a demonstration report is not identical to a typical appraisal report, and is intended to showcase the student's understanding of the theory and application of appraisal concepts.</P1>
<P1>(ii) Ms. Skolney says that she handwrote her assignments. However, as noted above, this does not explain why significant extracts of text match between her demonstration report and Mr. Bubula's. She confirmed in cross-examination that the handwritten assignments were completed before she typed the assignments, and they are identical to the text that appeared in the assignments and final demonstration report. The Association submits that the best inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that Ms. Skolney began copying from Mr. Bubula's work when she handwrote her assignments.</P1>
<P1>(iii) The third reason offered is that Ms. Skolney's tutor told her to cut back on her citations. In addition to this testimony being inadmissible hearsay, we submit it is unlikely that her tutor would give her carte blanche to copy large extracts of text from another student's report, especially since this directly contravenes the instructions in the BUSI workbook. This also does not provide a compelling explanation for why sections analyzing data and providing conclusions that reference the subject property are also identical or nearly identical, or why common errors were made.</P1>
<P1>(iv) Ms. Skolney testified that she made an error in Assignment #11, and it trickled down through the remaining assignments. On cross examination she confirmed this was a mathematical error. We submit this reason cannot account for the matching text, errors and typos in her written analysis.</P1>
<P1>(v) With reference to matching text found in her report Tab 30 at page 41, and in Mr. Bubula's report Tab 40 at page 54, Ms. Skolney testified that &lsquo;it's what I do at work&rsquo;. The Association took that to mean that it was her position that it was common practice in appraisal offices to copy from the text of other appraisals. This may or may not be the case, but it cannot override the express instructions in the BUSI 499 Workbook. The expectation in the BUSI 499 course is that students will do their own work, and that includes developing their own narrative to explain the concepts in the course. Mr. McKinnon's evidence was clear that the demonstration report is not the same as an appraisal report, and it is intended to showcase the student's understanding of the theory and application of fundamental concepts. Ms. Skolney acknowledged that she had regard for the instructions in the BUSI 499 workbook when she completed the course, and she ought to have been aware that copying text was not permitted.</P1>
<P1>(vi) Ms. Skolney offered an explanation regarding the SPIN map and the situation where three lots sold as opposed to the demonstration report showing just one sale, that these were the instructions of her tutor. However, the SPIN map in Ms. Skolney's report while not having an arrow pointing to the lot, still has cross hatching identifying the incorrect lot. Given that Mr. Bubula makes the same errors we would have to assume that Mr. Bubula was told the same thing by his tutor. In addition to this being inadmissible hearsay, this explanation is not plausible. What is plausible is that Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula.</P1>
<P1>(vii) Ms. Skolney pointed to the use of formulas from the Workbook found in her demonstration report as evidence that she was permitted to copy from the BUSI workbook, however, this explanation does not account for the sheer volume of similar text, most of which does not appear in the BUSI workbook. Mr. McKinnon's evidence was that the four members of the Practice Review Committee were not concerned with common formulas.</P1>
<P1>(viii) Ms. Skolney testified that common documents like the scope and letter of transmittal were taken from the CUSPAP standards. This was acknowledged by Mr. McKinnon, but do not account for paragraph after paragraph of matching text in other sections of the report. Further, Ms. Skolney did not introduce any documents from CUSPAP into evidence to substantiate her theory that some or all of the similar text in both reports came from that document.</P1>
<P1>(ix) Ms. Skolney suggested that her tutor allowed copying from the textbook. There are several problems with this explanation. First, Ms. Skolney's testimony on this point is inadmissible hearsay, and should be disregarded. Second, the sentence structure used by Ms. Skolney and Mr. Bubula and the grammatical errors, would not be commonly found in a textbook. Third, it is not believable that, contrary to the express instructions in the BUSI 499 Workbook, the tutor would direct a student to copy at will from the text book or other sources without the appropriate citation. Fourth, even if the tutor did instruct Ms. Skolney to copy from the textbook, the textbook was not entered into evidence to substantiate that theory.</P1>
<P1>(x) It was Ms. Skolney's evidence that she and Mr. Bubula used a similar type of property (multi bay warehouse) located in the same area of the City, and that this would account for the similarities in the demonstration reports. It is not plausible that this similarity could account for the identical narrative in the areas of the demonstration report where the student was to explain concepts in their own words. Mr. McKinnon was asked these questions in cross examination and he emphatically denied that this could account for the matching text and errors.</P1>
<P1>(xi) Ms. Skolney denied copying her report from Mr. Bubula's or from any other demonstration report. Her evidence is that she did not become aware that other students' demonstration reports were accessible on a shared drive at the City of Edmonton until after the complaints were filed. This testimony is not believable, given all of the evidence of similar and identical text and errors that appear in both her report and Mr. Bubula's.</P1></P>
<P>35. The Association submits that after all the various explanations offered by Ms. Skolney are put to the side, nothing can account for the paragraphs of matching text, errors and typos, except that Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="X">BREACH OF THE CODE OF CONDUCT</TI>
<P>36. If the Court is satisfied that Ms. Young copied large portions of her demonstration report from Ms. Rookes, and Ms. Skolney copied large portions of her demonstration report from Mr. Bubula, then the Association submits that such conduct clearly breaches the Association's Code of Conduct in place at the time. The Code of Conduct is set out in section 24 of the <EM>Municipal Assessor Regulation</EM>, Alta Reg 347/2009. In particular, the Code of Conduct requires assessors to &ldquo;perform the practice of assessment with fairness, honesty and integrity&rdquo; (subsection (b)), &ldquo;always act in accordance with the duties and responsibilities associated with being a member of the Association&rdquo; (subsection (g)), and &ldquo;at all times act in a manner that will enhance the image of the profession and the Association&rdquo; (subsection (h)). All of these subsections were expressly cited in the Complaint Forms filed by the Practice Review Committee.</P>
<P>37. The Court heard testimony from Angel Svennes, Jeff McKinnon, and Laurie Hodge confirming that demonstration reports are an integral component to the Association's accreditation process. Angel Svennes confirmed that the Executive Committee was concerned about allegations of widespread plagiarism because, if those allegations were true, that could harm the public's confidence in assessors, and calls into question whether those members did, in fact, complete all of the accreditation requirements on their own. Honesty and integrity are two words that expressly appear in the Code of Conduct, and deliberately copying sections of a demonstration report from another violates these two foundational principles.</P>
<P>38. Further, the Association notes that the BUSI workbook contains many express and clear instructions prohibiting students from copying text from other sources, including old demonstration reports completed by other students. The BUSI workbook contains multiple warnings that copying or plagiarizing sections of the demonstration report could lead to additional sanctions from the student's professional association. Both Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young signed the declaration at the end of the BUSI workbook, which acknowledged these warnings, and the Association's Marking Application Form and Property Registration Form, which also contain clear warnings about copying and plagiarism. Read in conjunction with the Code of Conduct, Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young should have been aware that copying large sections of their demonstration reports violated the Association's expectations, and could lead to sanctions by the Discipline Committee.</P>
<P>39. Plagiarizing demonstration reports from other sources violates the Association's Code of Conduct, and constitutes unprofessional conduct worthy of sanction.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="XI">SANCTIONS REQUESTED</TI>
<P>40. The Association asks that this Court uphold the sanctions imposed by the Discipline Committee, namely that Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young be directed to re-take the BUSI 499 course, and to take an ethics course. The Decisions issued by the Discipline and Executive Committees provide fulsome rationales for why these penalties are appropriate given the conduct, and they serve to further the public's confidence in the integrity of the municipal assessor profession and addresses the misconduct by requiring further education to re-do the demonstration report, and take a course in professional ethics. We also submit that the fines and costs with respect to the tribunal hearings as levied by the Discipline Committee and affirmed by the Executive Committee be upheld, although we ask that the parties be permitted to make further submissions oncosts for the Court of Queen's Ben otherwise reach an agreement on that issue) once the Court has rendered its decision on these matters. The Association submits that the Court should review the Decisions from the Discipline Committee and Executive Committee in detail, as they provide fulsome rationales for the findings of unprofessional conduct, and the penalties imposed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="XII">CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>41. The Association submits that sections like section 19 of POARA and section 24 of the <EM>Municipal Assessor Regulation</EM> are broadly drafted to allow for two objectives. The first objective is to describe behaviour that the regulated member is to adhere to. Codes of Conduct are not written with a list of prohibited behaviours, that is a drafting technique more often found in criminal legislation. The second objective is to allow flexibility and the exercise of peer to peer judgment among professionals. The Association under POARA is a self-regulating body with a duty to investigate breaches of the Code and instances of unprofessional conduct. The Association did so and laid 11 complaints including those against Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney with respect to the copying of demonstration reports from other sources.</P>
<P>42. The Court must ask itself whether it is more likely than not, that two students working independently could prepare reports with such a high level of exact text, and errors and typos, or, is it more likely than not that Ms. Young copied from Ms. Rookes and Ms. Skolney copied from Mr. Bubula. The Association submits that the evidence supports this second conclusion.</P>
<P>43. The volume of matching text in areas of the demonstration report expected to be the student's own work, coupled with the numerous errors and typos, we submit, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the Applicants copied, as found by the Discipline Committee and the Executive Committee.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF LAURIE HODGE SWORN ON January 11, 2019</TI>
<P>I, Laurie Hodge, of the City of Edmonton, Alberta, SWEAR AND SAY THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the Executive Director and Registrar for the Alberta Assessors' Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). In my capacity as Executive Director, I oversee all administrative functions of the AAA, including liaison with its committees. In my capacity as Registrar, I maintain the list of regulated members of the AAA, and I serve specific functions on different AAA committees. For example, during disciplinary hearings, I serve as the Clerk for the panel, and I take minutes for the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>2. All candidates who wish to obtain accreditation as Accredited Municipal Assessors of Alberta (&ldquo;AMAA&rdquo;) must, as part of their training, complete a Demonstration Report through the BUSI 499 course offered by the University of British Columbia (&ldquo;UBC&rdquo;). Pursuant to AAA policy, each Demonstration Report is kept by the AAA for a period of seven years after it is submitted.</P>
<P>3. The AAA became aware of possible plagiarism of Demonstration Reports in 2013 during a disciplinary hearing against a member who testified, during a hearing, that &ldquo;...lots of people do their reports this way.&rdquo; That member had been disciplined for plagiarizing substantial amounts of their Demonstration Report that was submitted as part of the accreditation process to the AAA.</P>
<P>4. Following that hearing, at the direction of the Executive Committee, I manually reviewed some reports and advised the Practice Review Committee (PRC) and the Executive Committee that there may be additional instances of reports with sections of copied text. The PRC, being responsible for the Association's education requirements and continuing professional development, was given the task of reviewing archived Demonstration Reports for plagiarism by the Executive Committee. Historically, investigations into allegations of plagiarism had been taken on by the PRC on behalf of the AAA.</P>
<P>5. Based on my role taking minutes for the Executive Committee, the Executive Committee of the AAA, as a potential appeal body, limited its discussions to oversight and financial decisions and was not provided specifics or details of members or archived reports (i.e. numbers, areas of concern etc.). I was directed to contact the University of British Columbia, Real Estate Division (&ldquo;UBC&rdquo;) to learn their process relative to screening written submissions by students for plagiarism.</P>
<P>6. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of the membership of the AAA's committees in 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16.</P>
<P>7. UBC tested two concerning reports identified by the AAA against an original (allegedly copied) report using the Turn It In software program. UBC found that, while some similarities are to be expected between reports, the similarities found in these reports were far higher than what would be considered acceptable.</P>
<P>8. Based on this information, the AAA Executive Committee then deliberated various options from manual review of select reports, free text matching software tests, and purchasing software and processing all archived reports. The latter option was chosen and the Executive Committee directed me to contact iThenticate for prices and specifications.</P>
<P>9. The Executive Committee directed me to review all archived Demonstration Reports through the iThenticate text-matching software.</P>
<P>10. Turn It In is a student-centered application of the same text-matching program as iThenticate. Turn It In allows students to submit written assignments to test for plagiarism against an online database; iThenticate allows the licenseholder to create its own database against which assignments are matched. The AAA purchased a 12-month license to use the iThenticate software and advised all members whose Demonstration Reports were archived that it would be reviewing the archived Reports and action might follow. Since some members of the PRC were among members whose reports were archived, those members were recused from any and all PRC discussions related to the matter.</P>
<P>11. Four PRC members were able to proceed with the review. The four PRC members who manually reviewed the results from the iThenticate software were Ray Crews, Todd Brasseur, Rene Boutin and Jeff MacKinnon.</P>
<P>12. To process the reports, I scanned the reports into an optical character recognition (OCR) formatted portable document format (PDF), using a naming protocol that identified the author and the date of his or her submission. A scanner of the same model used by UBC was purchased by the AAA for this purpose. I then received training in operating the iThenticate software, and used it to compare each Demonstration Report against others in the database. I generated an iThenticate Report for each Demonstration Report, which showed the degree of similarity between the Demonstration Report and other reports in the database.</P>
<P>13. Following initial processing, the four members of the PRC assigned to review the results were permitted to access the iThenticate folder and review the results electronically.</P>
<P>14. The four members of the PRC chose to manually review, in person, any Demonstration Report with a similarity rating of 40% or higher. I provided reports meeting that threshold to the PRC for the manual review, but otherwise was not involved in the manual review personally. The PRC did not review any reports with a similarity rating less than 40%.</P>
<P>15. Following the in-person review by the PRC, eleven reports were held for further consideration by the PRC, including the reports of Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney. For the remaining members whose archived demonstration reports were no longer subject to further review, the PRC directed me to advise those members of the same.</P>
<P>16. In June 2014, the PRC completed its review of several Demonstration Reports, and submitted the following complaint to the Chair of the Discipline Committee:
<P1>a. Teresa Young for a report submitted in 2011 with a similarity of 67% to archived reports, the most frequent being a report submitted in 2009 authored by member Gail Rookes.</P1></P>
<P>17. In September 2014, the PRC completed its review of further Demonstration Reports, and submitted the following complaint to the Chair of the Discipline Committee:
<P1>a. Cherie Skolney for a report submitted in 2012 with a similarity of 61% to archived reports, the most frequent being a report submitted in 2011 authored by member Peter Bubula.</P1></P>
<P>18. The complaints were reviewed by the four members of the PRC who oversaw the iThenticate review. Attached to this my affidavit as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the signed complaints of the Practice Review Committee members who completed that review with respect to Teresa Young and Cherie Skolney.</P>
<P>19. These reports were among the first to have reviews completed due to the high degree of similarity between Ms. Rookes' report and Ms. Young's. Reviews of the remaining reports continued until September 2014, when Ms. Skolney's report was reviewed.</P>
<P>20. The PRC submitted its complaints to the Chair of the Discipline Committee. The Chair reviewed the complaints and decided they disclosed allegations of sufficient merit to warrant an investigation by the Discipline Committee. The Chair appointed an Investigative Team comprised of other members of the Discipline Committee to investigate the complaints.</P>
<P>21. The Investigative Team was comprised of Ryan Heit, Brian Lutz and Alana Hempel. The Chair of the Discipline Committee was Don Swant.</P>
<P>22. I had no involvement with the decision by the Chair to refer the complaints to an investigation, nor in the investigation conducted by the Investigative Team. It has been suggested that I improperly shared information with members of the PRC, the Discipline Committee and the Executive Committee. I am very aware of the entire complaint and appeal process and the critical importance of only providing appropriate information to each of these bodies.</P>
<P>23. The Investigative Team was tasked with reviewing the complaint submitted by the PRC along with supporting documents to determine whether each complaint was frivolous or vexatious, or whether it should proceed to a hearing. For both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, the Investigative Team decided the complaints advanced by the PRC had sufficient merit to warrant a hearing before a panel of the Discipline Committee.</P>
<P>24. No member of the Investigative Team served on the panels that adjudicated the complaints against Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young. The Chair of the Discipline Committee, Don Swant, did sit on the panel which adjudicated Ms. Young's claim, but he was not involved in the review conducted by the Investigative Team.</P>
<P>25. Both Ms. Young's and Ms. Skolney's matters were referred to panels of the Discipline Committee for adjudication.</P>
<P>26. Ms. Young's hearing before a panel of the Discipline Committee took place on April 13&ndash;15, 2015 and July 13 and 14, 2015. The panel was comprised of Don Swant as Chair, Ron Van Dam, Diane Fraser, and Hilary Argento. Gwendolyn Stewart-Palmer of Shores Jardine LLP served as independent counsel to the panel. The panel found Ms. Young guilty of conduct deserving of sanction in a decision released on August 28, 2015.</P>
<P>27. Ms. Skolney's hearing before a panel of the Discipline Committee took place on April 6 and 7, 2016, after several adjournments. The panel was comprised of Hilary Argento, Ron Van Dam, Diane Fraser, Dan Hatch and Rob Balhorn. Gwendolyn Stewart-Palmer of Shores Jardine LLP served as independent counsel to the panel. The panel found Ms. Skolney guilty of conduct deserving of sanction in a decision released on February 8, 2017.</P>
<P>28. Both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney appealed their disciplinary decisions to the AAA Executive Committee. To the best of my recollection, both of their appeals were heard by the entire Executive Committee, and both appeals were dismissed. None of the individuals who heard and decided the appeals were part of the panel of the Practice Review Committee which reviewed the iThenticate reports, nor were they involved in the discipline process prior to the appeals.</P>
<P>29. It has been suggested that members of the Practice Review Committee, Discipline Committee, and Executive Committee improperly colluded during the investigation and adjudication of these complaints. No evidence has been adduced by the complainants at any time to substantiate these assertions, and I never observed any collusion between the members of these committees in my interactions with them.</P>
<P>30. It has been suggested that members of the Practice Review Committee, Discipline Committee, and Executive Committee improperly shared confidential information about the matters before them with their spouses and other AAA members, and that this raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. No evidence has been adduced by the complainants at any time to substantiate these assertions, and I never observed any member of these committees improperly share confidential information with others pertaining to these complaints.</P>
<P>31. It has been suggested that Ms. Young had a bad relationship with Ryan Heit at a job she previously held, and the fact that he served on the Discipline Committee and was part of the panel that reviewed the PRC complaint gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. I cannot confirm whether Ms. Young's relationship with Mr. Heit was strained, but in my opinion, Mr. Heit's involvement in reviewing the complaint laid by the PRC was minor and limited to determining whether the complaint <EM>prima facie</EM> disclosed potential misconduct.</P>
<P>32. It has been suggested that Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young were denied procedural fairness because Ryan Heit's report was also reviewed by the PRC. It is true that Mr. Heit's report was one of the reports initially reviewed using the iThenticate program, however, by the time Mr. Heit reviewed the complaint filed by the PRC in his capacity as a member of the Discipline Committee, his report had already been reviewed and cleared as it did not meet the 40% similarity threshold the PRC members chose to review. Mr. Heit's report was not manually reviewed at any time by the PRC; the only review conducted was through the iThenticate program. Mr. Heit had no involvement with the PRC's review of the Demonstration Reports, including those of Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young, and his own.</P>
<P>33. It has been suggested that Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney have had negative personal interactions in the past with certain AAA members, including Ryan Heit, Nathalie Thibault, Deanne Bannerman, Stephen Bannerman, Colin Hindman, Rene Boutin and Travis Lantz. At the time of the investigation into Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, all of these individuals were accredited Municipal Assessors with the AAA. I have no personal knowledge to confirm or deny whether Ms. Young or Ms. Skolney had strained personal relationships with any of these individuals.</P>
<P>34. Ryan Heit, Nathalie Thibault, Deanne Bannerman, Stephen Bannerman, Colin Hindman, and Travis Lantz were not involved in the PRC's investigation into Ms. Young's and Ms. Skolney's reports.</P>
<P>35. Collin Hindman was a member of the Executive Committee from 2013&ndash;2016. Stephen Bannerman was a member of the Executive Committee from 2013-2014.</P>
<P>36. I make this affidavit in support of the AAA's application to strike issues related to purported bias from the issues to be considered by the Court of Queen's Bench at the re-hearing of these matters on June 3&ndash;7, 2019.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">a. Background</TI>
<P>1. Both Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young are appealing decisions made by the Alberta Assessors' Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) Executive Committee with respect to alleged unprofessional conduct and breaches of the AAA's <EM>Code of Conduct</EM>. The AAA is governed by the <EM>Professional and Occupational Associations Registration Act</EM>, RSA 2000, c P-26 [<EM>POARA</EM>]. Under section 37 of <EM>POARA</EM>, members may appeal disciplinary decisions made by the AAA's governing body (the Executive Committee) to the Court of Queen's Bench, and such appeals are to &ldquo;be by way of a rehearing of the matter on the merits.&rdquo;
<P1><BOLD><EM>POARA</EM>,</BOLD> section 37(3) <BOLD>[TAB 1]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>2. The affidavit of Laurie Hodge filed in support of the AAA's application sets out the factual context of the disciplinary proceedings conducted by the AAA against Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney.</P>
<P>3. On September 15, 2016, Justice Sulyma granted a procedural order in the matter of <CASEREF><SOC>Teresa Young v Alberta Assessors Association Practice Review Committee</SOC></CASEREF> specifying that Ms. Young's statutory appeal would be heard via a Special Chambers hearing with viva voce evidence. The Order contemplated that the parties would file an Agreed Statement of Facts, Issues and Documents, witness statements and written argument prior to the Special Chambers date. The parties were unable to come to an agreement on the Agreed Statement of Facts, Issues and Documents, and Ms. Young failed to schedule a Special Chambers date.</P>
<P>4. Ms. Skolney applied via Originating Application for a statutory appeal of a decision of the Alberta Assessors Association Executive Committee (<CASEREF><SOC>Cherie Skolney v Alberta Assessors Association Executive Committee</SOC></CASEREF>) relating to allegations similar to those made against Ms. Young. The parties agreed to consolidate these two statutory appeals into a single hearing due to common issues and facts that underpin both.</P>
<P>5. The hearing is scheduled to run for five days from June 3&ndash;7, 2019. While the parties are hoping to file an Agreed Statement of Facts, Issues and Documents to streamline the proceedings, the parties have been unable to agree on the inclusion of several issues related to the alleged bias of decision-makers involved in the process. Attached at Tab 2 is a copy of a draft Agreed Statement of Issues, with issues the AAA objects to highlighted in blue and struck out.
<P1><BOLD>Draft Agreed Statement of Issues [TAB 2]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. The AAA submits that, as the hearing before the Court of Queen's Bench is intended to be a <EM>de novo</EM> hearing, where the presiding Justice will decide the merits of the matters afresh, it is inappropriate to include issues that concern the alleged bias of the decision-makers below. Those allegations would be appropriate in the context of a judicial review, but that is not the nature of the hearing scheduled before the Court of Queen's Bench.</P>
<P>7. Further, both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney have levied baseless allegations that the investigative and adjudication process was tainted due to poor interactions they had in the past with other AAA members and their spouses. These allegations relate to individuals who either had no involvement with the process, or the allegations, even if proven, are incapable of demonstrating institutional bias. The AAA submits that these allegations of a reasonable apprehension of bias should not be considered at the June hearing as they lack merit, and that the affidavit of Laurie Hodge filed in support of this application is a sufficient evidentiary basis to dispose of these allegations.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">b. Structure of the AAA and Complaints Process</TI>
<P>8. The AAA is structured in accordance with the <EM>Municipal Assessor Regulation</EM>, Alta Reg 347/2009, which is a regulation under <EM>POARA</EM>. The Executive Committee is given the overall responsibility for managing the Association. It hears appeals of disciplinary decisions made by the Discipline Committee. The Practice Review Committee, by statute, is given the responsibility to conduct reviews into the practice of Regulated Members with the Executive Committee's approval. If that review discloses potential professional misconduct within the meaning of section 19 of <EM>POARA</EM>, it must file a complaint with the Chair of the Discipline Committee. The Chair of the Discipline Committee then reviews the allegation to determine if it is frivolous or vexatious&mdash;if it passes that low threshold, then a panel is struck of other members of the Discipline Committee to conduct a hearing.

<P1><BOLD><EM>POARA</EM>,</BOLD> s 19 <BOLD>[TAB 1]</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>POARA Flow Chart [TAB 4]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. This process was followed with respect to the allegations against Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, the particulars of which are set out in the affidavit of Laurie Hodge.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">c. Institutional Bias</TI>
<P>10. Both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney raise grounds related to the institutional bias of the Discipline Committee and Executive Committee.</P>
<P>11. Institutional bias concerns the structure or operation of a decision making body, rather than the words, actions, or relationships of an individual tribunal member assigned to hear a case. The difficulty in a claim for institutional bias claim is reconciling the concept of a judicial decision making structure with the structure created by the legislature in the statute under review. It is important to distinguish between arguments which challenge the legislation itself, and arguments which attack the way the legislation is applied. Arguments that challenge the legislation itself based on the duty of fairness and the principles of natural justice will be dismissed because these are issues that must be resolved by the Legislature and cannot be remedied by a Tribunal.
<P1><BOLD>Principles of Administrative Law pages 421 - 422 [TAB 5]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>12. The Supreme Court has stated that the general test for institutional bias is:
<QUOTE><P><EM>The determination of institutional bias presupposes that a well-informed person, view the matter realistically and practically&mdash;and having thought the matter through&mdash;would have a reasonable apprehension of bias in a substantial number of cases. In this regard, all factors must be considered, but the guarantees provided for in the legislation to counter the prejudicial effects of certain institutional characteristics must be given special attention</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Thus we can see that the unique feature of the test for institutional bias is the requirement that the apprehension of bias exist in &ldquo;a substantial number of cases&rdquo;. As demonstrated in the Quebec (Regie des permis d'alcool) case itself, the facts of any particular case before the tribunal can be of limited significance with respect to a finding of institutional bias. What tends to be more important is whether the legislature has expressly or impliedly authorized a decision making scheme that gives rise to this type of apprehension of bias and, if so, whether that legislative decision can be successfully challenged using the Charter or a quasi-constitutional statute such as the Canadian Bill of Rights, the Alberta Bill of Rights or the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Principles of Administrative Law page 423 [TAB 5]</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. Institutional bias arguments have tended to be made in the following situations:
<P1>a. where a tribunal member carries out more than one function in relation to a particular case,</P1>
<P1>b. where tribunal staff are employed in ways that give rise to bias concerns,</P1>
<P1>c. where a party to the proceeding has an institutional role in the proceeding that might be thought to bias the outcome,</P1>
<P1>d. where the tribunal is thought to have a financial interest in the outcome, and</P1>
<P1>e. where a tribunal engages in internal consultations concerning a case in a manner that is thought to be improper. We will respond the allegations raised by the Appellants under these five areas.</P1></P>
<P>14. As can be seen, the test for institutional bias is concerned with the judicial review of a decision made by an adjudicative process. Under <EM>POARA</EM>, an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench constitutes a &ldquo;re-hearing on the merits.&rdquo; The Court will not be reviewing the decisions of the Discipline Committee and Executive Committee; accordingly, allegations regarding institutional bias should not be raised or considered at the re-hearing.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">d. Lack of Independence and Impartiality of the Discipline Committee</TI>
<P>15. Both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney intend to argue that the Discipline Committee lacked independence in the adjudication of their claims, and was not impartial.</P>
<P>16. The impartiality and independence of the Discipline Committee in hearing and adjudicating the complaints before it are irrelevant in the context of a <EM>de novo</EM> hearing before the Court of Queen's Bench. Even if the process before the Discipline Committee was tainted by a lack of independence or impartiality (which is strongly denied by the AAA), any procedural defects can be cured by the Court making its own independent decision at the <EM>de novo</EM> hearing. These allegations would be appropriate to consider in the context of a judicial review, but that is not the procedure mandated by <EM>POARA</EM>.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">e. Pecuniary Interest of the Executive Committee in the Laying and Prosecution of the Complaints</TI>
<P>17. Both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney allege that the Executive Committee was biased because it had a pecuniary interest to recoup the costs of the investigation that led to the complaints against them. In particular, both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney point to the fact that the Executive Committee authorized the purchase of a license for the software program that was used to analyze Demonstration Reports submitted to the AAA as evidence of a pecuniary interest in recouping those costs. It is alleged that this further tainted the process before the Discipline Committee at the appeal stage.</P>
<P>18. Even if Ms. Young's and Ms. Skolney's allegations are true, any procedural defect in the hearing before the Discipline Committee will be cured by having the Court of Queen's Bench decide the merits of the complaints afresh. These allegations do not impugn the investigation into the Demonstration Reports filed by the AAA, these allegations only relate to the appeals heard by the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>19. Prior to those appeals, the Executive Committee's role was limited to deciding whether the Practice Review Committee should be given the responsibility to review all Demonstration Reports filed with the AAA, due to information received in the course of another disciplinary hearing which suggested plagiarism of Demonstration Reports was common. The Executive Committee approved the investigation, approved purchasing a software license to complete the review, and tasked the Practice Review Committee with completing the review. The Executive Committee was otherwise not involved in the Practice Review Committee's investigation, the laying of the complaints, or the adjudication of those complaints before the Discipline Committee. In the circumstances, the investigation cannot be said to be tainted by the alleged pecuniary interest of the Executive Committee, because the Practice Review Committee completed the investigation and laid the complaints that are now the subject of this re-hearing.</P>
<P>20. The alleged pecuniary interest of the Executive Committee is irrelevant to a process which intends to examine the merits of the complaints made against Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, and it should not be considered at the re-hearing before the Court of Queen's Bench.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">f. Allegation of Bias due to Involvement of Ryan Heit</TI>
<P>21. Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney allege that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists due to the involvement of Ryan Heit in reviewing the complaint as a member of the Discipline Committee. In particular, Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney allege that Mr. Heit's Demonstration Report was also reviewed by the Practice Review Committee, and that he was a member of the Practice Review Committee at the time of the investigation.</P>
<P>22. This is factually incorrect. As the affidavit of Laurie Hodge filed in support of this application attests, Mr. Heit was not a member of the Practice Review Committee at the time the Demonstration Reports were investigated. He was not involved in the initial review of Demonstration Reports, or deciding whether a complaint should be laid against Ms. Skolney or Ms. Young.</P>
<P>23. It is true that Mr. Heit's Demonstration Report was reviewed using the iThenticate program, but his report did not meet the 40% similarity threshold set by the Practice Review Committee to warrant a manual review by the committee. Accordingly, no member of the Practice Review Committee manually reviewed his report. As noted in Ms. Hodge's affidavit, he had no involvement in this process.</P>
<P>24. Mr. Heit was a member of the Discipline Committee at the time the allegations against Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young were referred to that committee for possible disciplinary action by the Practice Review Committee. The Chair of the Discipline Committee tasked Mr. Heit (along with two other members) with reviewing the complaints filed by the Practice Review Committee and supporting documents to determine if they <EM>prima facie</EM> disclosed conduct that may warrant disciplinary intervention following a thorough adjudication by a separately-constituted panel of the Discipline Committee. By the time Mr. Heit reviewed the complaints filed by the Practice Review Committee, including those pertaining to Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, his Demonstration Report had already been reviewed using the iThenticate program, and had been cleared.</P>
<P>25. In the circumstances, the allegations pertaining to Mr. Heit's involvement lack merit, and should be dismissed on the basis of the affidavit evidence filed.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VII">g. Allegation of Bias due to Involvement of Laurie Hodge</TI>
<P>26. Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young allege that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists due to the involvement of Laurie Hodge in assisting the various committees with their respective roles. Ms. Hodge is an employee of the AAA, and her duties and responsibilities include assisting the AAA's committees with administrative tasks. As her affidavit attests, her role is limited to administrative functions, and she is not involved with the investigations conducted by the Practice Review Committee or the deliberations of the Discipline Committee or Executive Committee.</P>
<P>27. To the extent that Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young claim that Ms. Hodge shared confidential information between committees, that allegation lacks merit. They have not been able to adduce any evidence to support their assertions. The AAA submits that these groundless assertions should not be included as issues in the forthcoming June hearing.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VIII">h. Bad Relationships with other AAA Members and their Spouses</TI>
<P>28. Ms. Young has alleged that the entire investigation and adjudication process was tainted because of certain negative interactions with other AAA members prior to the investigation that led to the complaints now before this Court. Specifically, she alleges:
<P1>a. She levied a complaint to management about Ryan Heit when they worked together in the Residential Assessment branch at the City of Edmonton, and she claims that he was &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; towards her thereafter.</P1>
<P1>b. AAA members Deanne Bannerman and Nathalie Thibault served as her supervisor and manager for a time, and certain managerial decisions they made caused her to transfer out of their department, and &ldquo;strained&rdquo; her relationship with them.</P1>
<P1>c. She notes that Ryan Heit and Deanne Bannerman are &ldquo;close friends&rdquo;, and Deanne Bannerman is the sister of Rene Boutin (who was one of the members of the Practice Review Committee who signed the complaint against her). She also notes that Deanne Bannerman is the wife of Stephen Bannerman (who was a member of the Executive Committee at the time the investigation was approved), and that all of them were close friends and &ldquo;socialize outside of work.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>29. She alleges, without any justification or supporting evidence, that the individuals noted above shared information about her matter that should have been confidential.</P>
<P>30. For her part, Ms. Skolney alleges that Colin Hindman, who was once her direct supervisor, had a history of harassing her at work, and that he shared confidential information about her matter with Travis Lantz and Rene Boutin. She also alleges she had personal conflicts with Rene Boutin in the past. Ms. Skolney alleges the involvement of these individuals at various stages raises a reasonable apprehension of bias that taints the entire investigative and adjudication process.</P>
<P>31. None of the allegations made are meritorious. Both Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney have had numerous opportunities to disclose the basis for alleging that confidential information was improperly shared, and they have failed to provide any substantive evidence showing any of the individuals above acted improperly.</P>
<P>32. Many of the individuals summarized above had no involvement in the complaints against Ms. Young and Ms. Skolney, including Deanne Bannerman, Nathalie Thibault, and Travis Lantz.</P>
<P>33. Stephen Bannerman and Collin Hindman were members of the Executive Committee at the time the decision was made to task the Practice Review Committee with reviewing the Demonstration Reports on file, but this cannot raise a reasonable apprehension of bias, since he would not have known at that time whose Demonstration Reports would ultimately be subject to complaints.</P>
<P>34. Rene Boutin was one of the members of the Practice Review Committee who signed the complaint forms against Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young, but the mere fact that he is friends with other AAA members cannot lead to an inference that he shared confidential information improperly. Further, even if it is true that Rene Boutin had a bad relationship with Ms. Skolney in the past, that alone cannot lead to an inference that he was biased against her in his assessment of her Demonstration Report, and in any event, three other members of the Practice Review Committee also recommended a complaint be filed in her case.</P>
<P>35. For Ryan Heit, his involvement was limited to reviewing the complaint filed by the Practice Review Committee to determine if it raised matters that should be referred to a panel for adjudication. Even if it is true that he did not have a good relationship with Ms. Young in the past, that alone cannot raise a reasonable apprehension of bias in these circumstances. Two other individuals reviewed the complaints filed by the Practice Review Committee alongside him, and recommended they be referred to a disciplinary panel. The merits of the complaint itself and the investigation that led to it cannot be impugned by this allegation.</P>
<P>36. The AAA submits that the allegations raised by Ms. Skolney and Ms. Young with respect to the alleged bias of certain individuals against them lack merit, and even if true would be incapable of leading a court to find that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists, or in the alternative, is something the Court can cure by rehearing the matter on its merits. These allegations and issues should not be considered at the June hearing.</P>
<P>37. Section 37 of POARA provides that appeals are to be by way of a rehearing on the merits. Allegations of bias against prior administrative decision makers would be issues which could be advanced if the Queen's Bench process was either a statutory appeal on the record or an application for judicial review.</P>
<P>38. The AAA seeks direction as to the issues which will be heard at the June 3&ndash;7, 2019, hearing.</P>
