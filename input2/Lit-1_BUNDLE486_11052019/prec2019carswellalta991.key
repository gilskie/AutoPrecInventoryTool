<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I. INTRODUCTION</TI>
<P>1. The within action arises with respect to the lawyer-client relationship that existed as between Shidan Ashraf (&ldquo;Ashraf&rdquo;), and the Defendants, Gabor Zinner and Zinner Law Office (hereinafter &ldquo;Zinner&rdquo;). This action arises as a result of Zinner's professional negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The relationship between Ashraf and Zinner commenced when Ashraf approached Zinner in April 2012, seeking assistance regarding his problems with his then-employer, SNC Lavalin (&ldquo;SNC LAVALIN&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. Ashraf was formerly the Chief Engineer of Telecommunications discipline at SNC's Transmission and Distribution Division. Following a sustained and systematic campaign of marginalization and abuse by SNC which was designed to force Ashraf to leave his employment, Ashraf developed severe stress-related illnesses and eventually left his employment with SNC in August of 2011.</P>
<P>3. Ashraf formally retained Zinner to advise him on his legal rights and possibility of pursuing legal recourse against SNC (the &ldquo;Retainer Agreement&rdquo;). Zinner provided a legal opinion that advised framing the claim as a workplace injury rather than as constructive dismissal claim, which was what he had initially advised, because the quantum of award Ashraf could have collected would have greatly exceeded any pay in lieu of notice if the cause of action for constructive dismissal was pursued. Subsequently Zinner filed a Statement of Claim on July 31, 2012, as recognized by the courts as a standalone tort claiming damages for personal injury (the &ldquo;SNC Action&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. As a result of the manner in which Zinner framed the Statement of Claim, SNC filed an Application on September 14, 2012 to strike Ashraf's Statement of Claim in the SNC Action, alleging that Ashraf's claim was statutorily barred by the <EM>Workers' Compensation Act</EM> of Alberta (&ldquo;WCA&rdquo;). This came as a shock to Ashraf as the Defendants had not advised him of the existence of workers' compensation legislation, and its fatal statutory bar on a standalone tort.</P>
<P>5. Ashraf requested Zinner legal advice in terms of moving the action forward but the advice he received after several promises of providing advice soon, eventually came on October 4, 2012, that Ashraf shall discontinue the action should the <EM>WCA</EM> bar apply to the case.</P>
<P>6. Moreover, during the same period, Zinner took a position of disinterest and decided not to take any more proactive steps in moving the case forward without communicating this fact to Ashraf at the time.</P>
<P>7. As a result of the foregoing, Ashraf thereafter terminated the Retainer Agreement on October 9, 2012. However, the damages did not end there. Ashraf was left incapable of handing the SNC Action to another lawyer.</P>
<P>8. SNC's application to strike the SNC Action was heard on February 14, 2013, and the Court granted SNC's application.</P>
<P>9. There were nearly two dozen applications in the SNC Action, including two resulting in a reported decision from the Alberta Court of Appeal, in order to restore Ashraf's action and amend it to include claims for constructive dismissal. Ashraf represented himself at all of them while relying on the services and the legal advice he received from lawyers on project by project basis. His health worsened markedly during this period.</P>
<P>10. The SNC Action was scheduled to proceed to trial in November 2017. However, the lawyer Ashraf hired to prepare for the trail and represent him detected the error in limitations pleadings and advised him of very high risk of limitation arguments at the trial. Moreover, at the 11<SUP>th</SUP> hour she refused to represent the Plaintiff at the trial due to the offer of settlement from SNC. The Plaintiff suffered a series of panic attacks, got very sick, hospitalized and had to stay in bed for almost two weeks. The Plaintiff was unable to procced to trial due to, the high risk of losing the limitation arguments, the fact he was not going to be represented at the trial and his ill health just before the trial and therefore he followed the advice of his lawyer and settled the SNC Action for significantly less than it was worth.</P>
<P>11. Ashraf submits that Zinner is liable for but not limited to the numerous applications and the litigation required to revive the SNC Action all the way from 2012 to November 2017, the resulting shortfall in the SNC Action had the action been started properly, and the aggravation to Ashraf's mental and physical health and all the consequential loses and etc. These losses are direct, foreseeable results of Zinner's failure to provide reasonably competent legal services, along with Zinner essentially giving up on his client while remaining solicitor of record.</P>
<P>12. The parties have agreed to address the issue of damages, including the &ldquo;trial-within-a-trial,&rdquo; after this Court has made a determination with respect to liability.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II. FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>Background to the SNC Action</TI>
<P>13. As the result of the systematic campaign of marginalization and abuse by SNC designed to force Ashraf to leave his employment, Ashraf developed severe stress-related illnesses and eventually left his employment with SNC in August of 2011.</P>
<P>14. Ashraf went on short term disability on January 7, 2010, which converted to long term disability in three months later in April 2010. In October 2010, Sun Life Financial of Canada, the disability benefit provider, proposed to Ashraf gradual return to work plan to SNC. On August 2011, Ashraf informed Sun Life and SNC that he was not going to return to work for SNC because his several requests in writings and/or in person between October 2010 and June 2011, for his accommodation and improvement to the toxic work environment remained without any meaningful response.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Solicitor-client relationship between the Parties</TI>
<P>15. In April 2012, Ashraf met Zinner to provide legal services in relation to a potential lawsuit against his employer, SNC-Lavalin (&ldquo;SNC&rdquo;), as a result of the forgoing mistreatment. He received a draft of the retainer date April 26<SUP>th</SUP>, 2012 and paid Zinner a retainer amount of $5,000, on June 26, 2012 when Zinner returned from his holiday.</P>
<P>16. In his first meeting with Zinner, on April 26, 2012, Ashraf was advised that he had a cause of action for constructive dismissal and was assured that based on the facts and evidence presented to Zinner, a viable action could be commenced against SNC. In the second meeting on June 26, 2012, Zinner advised Ashraf he would &ldquo;sue in tort&rdquo; instead which will enable him to collect higher compensations for damages.</P>
<P>17. The only risk specific to the case identified by Zinner to Ashraf at that time was a potential issue with his limitation period, but he informed Ashraf that since he is a person suffering from a disability, he can rely on specific provision of the Alberta Limitations Act and seek suspension of the limitation clock. He did not present any case law to support his legal advice and did not show the high threshold of such pleadings.</P>
<P>18. Zinner wrote an opinion letter on July 12, 2012, expressing opinions against his earlier legal advice provided in the meetings he had with Ashraf in April and June 2012. Ashraf met with Zinner on the same date of July 12, 2012 and enquired about Zinner's change of mind. Ashraf also inquired as to why a tort claim raised by Zinner earlier was not discussed in his letter if he was advising against the cause of action for constructive dismissal. Also, Ashraf told Zinner that there are several medical documents he had given him on June 26, 2012 that commented on the facts that Ashraf's physical and psychological illnesses were caused by the stress due to the abusive conduct of his employer and the toxic work environment.</P>
<P>19. Zinner told Ashraf in the same meeting to stay and he will revise his letter. Ashraf was not feeling well and had to leave but Zinner promised to send a revised letter.</P>
<P>20. On July 16, 2012, Zinner sent a revised letter that included the cause of action in tort in addition to constructive dismissal with detailed calculations of the possible monetary value of the claim. Upon its receipt, Ashraf noticed the medical letters were not included and other incorrect statements were included, such as a statement that Ashraf wanted to proceed with litigation for the sake of making a statement even if he was going to be unsuccessful in the lawsuit.</P>
<P>21. These facts were brought to attention of Zinner by Ashraf, and despite Ashraf's preference that Zinner formulate his own understanding of the case, his opinion and pleadings, Zinner asked him to write his comments in the body of his July 16, 2012 opinion letter using the tracking feature of MS Word file.</P>
<P>22. Eventually Zinner sent back another draft of the opinion letter dated July 19, 2012. In the letter he largely copied and pasted Ashraf's language word for word, rather than analyzing the points added from a legal perspective. He also took out the cause of action in constructive dismissal and calculations for its damages from his opinion, confirming he was suing in tort only. This letter represented Zinner legal advice given in person to person meetings, which put Ashraf's mind somewhat at ease that Zinner had not missed or forgotten anything he had told Ashraf in person; however, it took much rework to synchronize Zinner's legal advice in person to what he had written in his opinion.</P>
<P>23. Subsequently, Zinner sent Ashraf a draft of the Statement of Claim which conformed with his July 19, 2012 opinion letter in which he did not allege constructive dismissal nor make any claims for damages arising from constructive dismissal such as pay in lieu of notice.</P>
<P>24. Ashraf reminded Zinner that some facts which he had told Ashraf he would have included in the claim were not there. Zinner asked Ashraf to write down the missing facts for Zinner's review, which Ashraf did.</P>
<P>25. The final draft was filed on July 31, 2012. It contained about three pages which included Ashraf's word for word feedback, which were intended for Zinner's sole use and consideration in adding properly drafted legal language to the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>26. Subsequent to the filing of the Statement of Claim, upon receipt of Zinner invoices, Ashraf met with Zinner on August 15, 2012 and expressed his frustration about the cost of the legal services to date, which had been higher than expected due to much reworks and inefficiencies in preparing the opinion and Statement of Claim. Reasonable number of hours were discussed based on earlier information given to Ashraf by Zinner for the work which was done.</P>
<P>27. Ashraf continued in the same meeting by saying that, in order to instill higher degree of accountability, he would only continue with Zinner if he agreed to the proposed revised semi-contingency payment arrangement, which was presented by Ashraf to Zinner.</P>
<P>28. Zinner apologized for the inefficiencies of his operation, committed to review the proposed payment scheme and get back to Ashraf in few days. At the within trial, Zinner admitted he never told Ashraf at the time he had not understood the proposed new terms of payment.</P>
<P>29. Zinner informed Ashraf on September 6, 2012, that he had just noticed a fax received from SNC three weeks earlier on August 17, 2012 asking for additional time to file a defense. Ashraf and Zinner met on the same date and Ashraf agreed with extension of time beyond the limitation period for the Defendant to respond. At the meeting Zinner also requested for payment to &ldquo;keep the lights on&rdquo;. Ashraf offered to pay according to the hours discussed on August 15, 2012, meeting which were recorded in their August 20 emails. Ashraf's calculations came to $3,500.00 while Zinner recalculated hours using the correct rate and came to an amount of $3,675.00. He asked Ashraf for that amount which Ashraf paid him upon Zinner agreeing that this sum was full payment for Zinner's work to date.</P>
<P>30. Zinner noted SNC in default on or around September 20, 2012, for being late by about 3 days in filing a response. But in fact, SNC lawyers had faxed their response to Zinner on time but again he had missed seeing the fax on time but only came to his attention after noting SNC in default.</P>
<P>31. On September 14, 2012, SNC had already filed an Application to strike Ashraf's Statement of Claim in the SNC Action, alleging that Ashraf's claim was statutorily barred by the Workers' Compensation Act of Alberta (&ldquo;WCA&rdquo;). This came as a shock to Ashraf as the Defendants had not advised him of the existence of workers' compensation legislation, and its fatal statutory baron a standalone tort or any other cause of action.</P>
<P>32. Ashraf requested legal advice in terms of moving the action forward but the advice he received after several promises of providing advice soon, eventually came on October 4, 2012, that Ashraf shall discontinue the action should the WCA bar apply to the case.</P>
<P>33. Moreover, during the same period, Zinner took a position of disinterest and decided not to take any more proactive steps in moving the case forward without communicating this fact to Ashraf at the time.</P>
<P>34. In the time period intervening between being notified of the WCA defense and being terminated, Zinner never advised Ashraf that he could amend his Statement of Claim to include a cause of action not barred under the WCA. Zinner never informed Ashraf at the time, of his disinterest to continue acting for Ashraf, or his intention in not providing proactive service which is despite his statement before the taxation officer in January 2013 and later on during the cross examination when he said he was &ldquo;conflicted&rdquo; about whether he wanted to continue acting for such a &ldquo;high-maintenance&rdquo; client, and as such, &ldquo;didn't take any more proactive steps on behalf of Mr. Ashraf&rdquo; until he was terminated. Transcript of Gabor Ivan Zinner, July 23, 2015, p 116, ll 6&ndash;23, is in reference.</P>
<P>35. As a result of the foregoing, Ashraf thereafter terminated the Retainer Agreement on October 9, 2012. Upon Zinner's termination, he refused to pay Ashraf back the retainer funds which were kept as a float and stated he had never agreed the amount received was in full satisfaction of his invoices. Prior to his termination from September 6 on which he received payment to October 9, 2012, Zinner neither followed up with Ashraf for what he later claimed Ashraf owed him nor sent any statements showing Ashraf is in arrears.</P>
<P>36. However, the damages did not end there. Ashraf was left with a summary judgement Application from SNC on his hands, he was still in shock of how Zinner could have betrayed his trust and also financially incapable of handing the SNC Action for representation to another lawyer.</P>
<P>37. Ashraf did seek and received legal advice subsequent to Zinner's termination and prior to the foregoing SJ application hearing that he should amend his Statement of Claim to include a claim for constructive dismissal. He was told that he would have to ask for the leave of the Court to do so when he appeared before Master Laycock.</P>
<P>38. Mr. Ashraf was not told that he could have amended without leave, given that no Statement of Defense was filed, and did not find this out until he appeared before Justice Mahoney on appeal from Master Laycock's decision striking his claim. Ashraf did in fact seek leave from Master Laycock to amend his claim and this request was denied.</P>
<P>39. SNC's application to strike the SNC Action was heard on February 14, 2013, and the Court granted SNC's application.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Procedural steps taken to salvage the SNC Action following the Defendant's breaches</TI>
<P>40. There were nearly two dozen applications in the SNC Action to restore the SNC Action and amend it to include constructive dismissal, including two resulting in reported decisions from the Alberta Court of Appeal. Ashraf represented himself at all of them while relying on the services and the legal advice he received from lawyers on project by project basis. His health worsened markedly during this period.</P>
<P>41. The restored SNC Action was scheduled to proceed to trial in November 2017. However, based on legal advice he received from his lawyer, he settled the SNC Action for significantly less than it was worth all evidence of which were presented at the trial.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III: ISSUES</TI>
<P>The Plaintiff's position may be summarized as follows:
<P1>I The Defendants equally liable regardless of professional incorporation, employee status and purported limitation of liability;</P1>
<P1>II The Defendants breach their tortious and contractual duty of care;</P1>
<P1>III The Plaintiff suffered damages caused by the Defendant's breaches of its tortious and contractual duties;</P1>
<P1>IV The Defendant's breach the fiduciary duty owed to the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>V The Plaintiff suffered damages caused by the Defendant's breaches of fiduciary duties;</P1></P>
<P>The parties have agreed to address the issues of remedies and damages after this Court has made a determination regarding liability.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART IV. ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>IV - I.</N><TI>The Defendants are equally liable regardless of professional incorporation, employee status and purported limitation of liability</TI>
<P>42. Zinner's personal liability is not affected by the fact that he operates as a professional corporation:

<BLOCK4><N><EM>A &gt;</EM></N><TI><EM>Zinner owed a duty to the Plaintiff to perform his duties to the standard of a reasonably prudent lawyer</EM></TI>
<P>44. A lawyer's duty of care applies to any act or omission in the performance of the services provided.

<P>45. The duty of care a lawyer owes his client in contract arises from the terms, both express and implied of any retainer agreement between them.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc.</SOC><CITE>[2007] 2 SCR 177</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2007 SCC 24</CITE><PARANUM>134</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, [TAB 34]</P1></P>
<P>46. The duty of care a lawyer owes his client in tort arises as a result of the relationship between solicitor and client.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Central Trust v Rafuse</SOC></CASEREF>, supra at para. 57 [TAB 4]</P1></P>
<P>47. Zinner's liability is concurrently in tort and contract. The duty of care, and thus an action for a breach of that duty, arises concurrently in tort and contract.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Central Trust v Rafuse</SOC></CASEREF>, supra, at para. 58 [TAB 4]</P1></P>
<P>48. Unless special terms in the retainer agreement limit or expand the duty of care, the duty is the same in both contact and tort.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Central Trust v Rafuse</SOC></CASEREF>,, <EM>supra</EM>, para. 69, [TAB 4]</P1></P>
<P>49. One requirement of professional competence is that a solicitor &ldquo;must have a sufficient knowledge of the fundamental issues or principles of law applicable to the particular work he has undertaken to enable him to perceive the need to ascertain the law on relevant points&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Central Trust v Rafuse</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, para. 67-68, [TAB 4]</P1></P>
<P>50. A lawyer is required to bring reasonable care, skill and knowledge to the performance of the professional services that the lawyer has undertaken for the client. The standard of care is that of the reasonably or ordinarily competent or prudent lawyer and that solicitor is required to &ldquo;bring reasonable care, skill and knowledge to the performance of the professional service which he has undertaken. Absent special contractual terms, the duties and standards set by contract and tort are the same.

<P>51. Moreover, the retainer between Ashraf and Zinner contained no limitations on the standard or duty of care owed by Zinner. Therefore, the applicable standard is that of an ordinary, reasonably competent litigator.</P>
<P>52. Zinner's incorrect and faulty legal advice was not a mere error of judgment. It was not a decision that was unwise in hindsight. Rather, Zinner's assessment of the merits of the SNC Action was incorrect because he did not exercise the knowledge of a reasonably competent lawyer....

<P>55. Although this Court is not bound by the Code of Conduct, it serves as <EM>&ldquo;an expression of a professional standard in a code of ethics&rdquo;</EM> and <EM>&ldquo;should be considered an important statement of public policy.&rdquo;</EM> The Code of Conduct is of importance in determining the nature and extent of duties flowing from the solicitor-client relationship.

<P>56. In particular, Rule 3.1-1 fleshes out what it means for a lawyer to be &ldquo;competent&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P><EM>3.1-1 &ldquo;competent lawyer&rdquo; means a lawyer who has and applies relevant knowledge, skills and attributes in a manner appropriate to each matter undertaken on behalf of a client and the nature and terms of the lawyer's engagement, including</EM>:</P>

<P1><EM>Code of Conduct, Law Society of Alberta</EM>, [TAB 12]</P1></P>
<P>57. Further, the Commentary to that Rule enumerates in its para 3, factors relevant to determining whether the lawyer employed the requisite degree of knowledge and skill in a particular matter, including:
<P1><EM>a. The complexity and specialized nature of the matter</EM>;</P1>
<P1><EM>b. The lawyer's general experience</EM>;</P1>
<P1><EM>c. The lawyer's training and experience in the field</EM>;</P1>
<P1><EM>d. The preparation and study the lawyer is able to give the matter; and</EM></P1>
<P1><EM>e. Whether it is appropriate or feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in question</EM>.</P1>
<P1><EM>Code of Conduct, Rule 3.1-1 Commt'y</EM> at para 3 [TAB 12]</P1></P>
<P>58. As noted above, Zinner's professional responsibility and his civil liability are two separate matters. However, the Code of Conduct provides evidence of &ldquo;customary norms&rdquo; that &ldquo;may be seen as implied terms of the retainer&rdquo; and &ldquo;part of the standard of care to be expected of a prudent practitioner.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Adeshina</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> at paras 116-117 [TAB 7]</P1></P>
<P>59. Indeed, Zinner's Retainer Agreement in Exhibit D.4 of the Plaintiff's Book of Exhibits, expressly named in its para 5, the identification of issues and &ldquo;thoroughness&rdquo; as a key characteristic of the solicitor-client relationship, But Zinner failed to deliver according to the terms of his retainer...
<QUOTE><BLOCK2><N>5.</N><TI>THE FIRM'S APPROACH</TI>
<P>We try to identify:</P>
<P>a) what you see as the issues,</P>
<P>b) what your concerns are,</P>
<P>c) what your expectations are.</P>
<P>To do this, thoroughness is very important. All the facts must be assessed. Issues must be identified, and once identified must be pursued with superior preparation and effort. Researchers assist in depth. This leads to superior results.</P></BLOCK2></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>B &gt;</EM></N><TI><EM>Zinner's substandard legal services fell below the requisite standard of care</EM></TI>
<P>60. The Plaintiff respectfully states that the Defendants breached their tortious and contractual duties of care with respect to at least four main areas:
<P1>a. failing to identify the applicable limitation period to the constructive dismissal claim;</P1>
<P1>b. failing to detect the <EM>WCA</EM> issue;</P1>
<P1>c. failing to plead the only meritorious cause of action, that is, constructive dismissal; and seek damages for stress arising from the manner of dismissal;</P1>
<P1>d. failing to address those errors by properly advising Ashraf of his procedural options in a timely manner or at all.</P1></P>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>Zinner did not identify the correct limitation period for the constructive dismissal claim</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>61. In carrying out his retainer, Zinner advised Ashraf that his treatment by the management of SNC, such as including but not limited to two unjustified demotions, virtual suspension, marginalization, humiliation, unjustified disciplinary actions with false accusations, reprimands, warnings, negative performance reviews, freezing salary and etc. and etc. as part of systematic abusive campaign to force him out of employment was one to give rise to a claim for constructive dismissal, were it not barred by the Limitations Act. He also told Ashraf that he would but frame the action in another branch of law as a tort instead of constructive dismissal to be able to claim higher compensation. However, in relation to a cause of action for constructive dismissal, Zinner's limitation opinion appeared to have been based on Zinner's belief that:</P>
<P>62. Limitations periods under the Limitations Act, RSA 2000 c. L-12, as amended, begin when an injured person becomes aware of their injuries;
<P1>a. Ashraf became aware of his injuries on the day he went on medical leave from work (January 7, 2010); and</P1>
<P1>b. This limitation period applied to constructive dismissal.</P1>
<P1>c. Ashraf became aware that the injuries warrant bringing an action;</P1>
<P1>d. This limitation period applied to constructive dismissal.</P1></P>
<P>63. Instead, the plain wording of section 3(l)(a) and (b) of the <BOLD><EM>Limitations Act</EM></BOLD> is ...
<P1>[TAB 13]</P1></P>
<P>64. Ashraf went to Zinner to find out whether or not he had grounds to complain about abusive conducts of his employer which forced him out of employment. Constructive dismissal was the &ldquo;<BOLD>essential character</BOLD>&rdquo; of his complaints for seeking justice. But even on a tort standard, his cause of action would not have &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; until he first spoke with Zinner on April 26, 2012.</P>
<P>65. In addition to assuming that a limitation period arises when injuries are sustained, and not when a claimant first learns that the injuries might warrant a proceeding, Zinner appears also to have determined that the &ldquo;injury&rdquo; suffered by Ashraf which would have given rise to the claim for constructive dismissal was having to go on disability on or around January 7, 2010. This was wrong, as the &ldquo;injury&rdquo; suffered in a claim for constructive dismissal arose from the manner of constructive dismissal in Ashraf's employment which ended in or about August 2011, after the employer shown their intention not to be bound by the terms of contract, implied or otherwise, which had made continued employment intolerable for Ashraf.</P>
<P>66. In other words, the injuries or loss of earning capacity and thereby the wage loss must have been among the heads of damages arising from the manner of constructive dismissal and not a standalone tort.</P>
<P>67. Correspondence between Ashraf and his employer between October 2010 and June 2011, in Plaintiff's Exhibits D8.1 to D8.4 (snc), D.54, are clear evidence of Ashraf's attempt to mitigate his losses by showing willingness, subject to his physician's supervision and approval, to undertake a gradual return to work plan as proposed by Sun Life, provided SNC would attend to the issues which had forced him out of work in the first place by way of causing him harm.</P>
<P>68. If for nothing else this lack of response of SNC and their unwillingness to accommodate Ashraf was a worthwhile test which proved the emptiness of SNC promises and lip service with no substance.</P>
<P>69. Ashraf requested SNC Lavalin, in good faith for meaningful accommodation of a gradual return to work plan, which fulfilled his legal duty to mitigate his losses as he had done before. However, when his requests remained without response and resolutions, his employment ended. It is submitted that it was at that point, and not at any earlier time, that Ashraf's cause of action for constructive dismissal fully &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; and the limitation period began to run.</P>
<P>70. In <CASEREF><SOC>Mifsud v. MacMillan Bathurst Inc</SOC><CITE>1989 CanLII 260</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, the Honourable courts stated the following with respect to the legal duty of an employee to mitigate his losses....
<P1>Page 12, Para 6, [TAB 57]</P1></P>
<P>71. However, Zinner assumed (incorrectly) that the limitation period on a claim for constructive dismissal had arisen when Ashraf went on disability leave, Zinner framed the Statement of Claim as an action for personal injuries at work, rather than a claim for constructive dismissal. He intentionally did not plead constructive dismissal as recorded in the cross examination, (Transcript July 23, 2015, page 113, lines 16-17) he did not even plead breach of employment contract as per his own testimonies under oath, telling Ashraf at the time that he would recover significantly more damages in the alternatives cause of action for a tort.</P>
<P>72. Whereas the cause of action in its essential character and <UNDER>true</UNDER> legal framework of the pleadings was one for constructive dismissal and its amendment later on to constructive dismissal was not an &ldquo;<BOLD>afterthought solution</BOLD>&rdquo;.</P>
<P>73. Ashraf submits that, particularly in light of Zinner's self-proclaimed expertise in employment law, Zinner breached the standard of care by failing to determine the correct limitation date of Ashraf's constructive dismissal claim.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>Zinner did not identify the WCA bar to the SNC Action</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>74. It is submitted that, at the time Zinner was acting for Ashraf, he crafted at least two bars to the claim as Zinner was framing it.</P>
<P>75. <BOLD>First,</BOLD> the claim would be (and was) barred by operation of sections 1(1)(a), 14(1), 21, of the <EM>Workers Compensation Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c. W-15, as amended, (herein after &ldquo;WCA&rdquo;) states, in material part...
<P1><EM>Workers Compensation Act</EM>, RSA 2000 c. W-15, [TAB 14]</P1></P>
<P>76. In the Province of Alberta, the <EM>WCA</EM> bar applies according to its <EM>Principles of WCA, System 3</EM>, which is in [TAB 15], to work-related injuries where and when the <UNDER>&ldquo;activities causing the injury are part of the employer's normal insured activities of employment, based on a reasonable person test, and operate to displace any tort remedy for that injury&rdquo;.</UNDER> The bar therefore applies to causes of actions when dismissal and/or breach of employment contract law are not pled and whether or not the injured employee receive disability benefits from WCA. Wrongful constructive dismissal and particularly the manner in which it is conducted is a breach in employment law to which the employer's corporation is a party and is not as part of normal insured activities of employment.
<P1><EM>Principles of WCA, System 3</EM>, which is in [TAB 15]</P1></P>
<P>77. The following case law show that the events and transaction in the SNC case would have not qualified for the definition &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. Also the WCA bar applies to &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, whether disability benefits are paid out or not by WCA. In <CASEREF><SOC>Medicine Hat (City) v. Wilson</SOC></CASEREF> (City Buses), the injuries of employees satisfied <EM>WCA's</EM> requirements for definition of accident, but no compensations were paid out to the employees due to inadequate evidence between cause and effect. Subsequently a civil action started against the employer which was dismissed by the court (AC of Alberta) because the WCA bar applied even when the alleged injured employee did not receive disability benefits because injuries were part of normal insured activities of employment and &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. In other words, WCA jurisdiction and its bar are based on satisfying the requirement for definition of &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and not whether such accidents warrant compensations.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Medicine Hat (City) v. Wilson (City Buses)</SOC></CASEREF> [TAB 16]</P1></P>
<P>78. What happened to Ashraf was not &ldquo;<EM>accident</EM>&rdquo; because it was not &ldquo;<EM>as part of normal insured activities of employment</EM>&rdquo;, the conduct of the management &ldquo;<EM>was not inherent hazard of employment</EM>&rdquo;, but the events and transactions that transpired were in violation of employment law, in breach of the duty of good faith and duty of care in the manner his employer was trying to get rid of him by forcing him to resign or have him terminated. Based on definition of accident provided by the <EM>WCA legislation</EM>, Table 1, in [TAB 16], sets down the qualifying criteria for &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, and briefly and clearly compare and differentiate the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v. SNC</SOC></CASEREF> as compared with <CASEREF><SOC>Medicine Hat (City) v. Wilson</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>79. Zinner admitted, at one point during questioning (Transcript P7 lines 40-41 and P8 lines 34-35, in Plaintiff Exhibit D.48) that at the time of drafting the statement of claim he was aware of the <EM>WCA</EM> bar to a personal injury claim created by the <EM>Workers Compensation Act</EM>. However, he later made a statement that he became aware of the <EM>WCA</EM> bar when brought to his attention by the opposing Application of SNC. However, if that is truly the case, he took no steps to make himself aware of this possible bar while drafting the St of Claim.</P>
<P>80. It is submitted that Zinner was aware of this bar and he derailed the action by intentionally, according to himself, not alleging constructive dismissal, not pleading breach of contract, not claiming damages born out of constructive dismissal and only claiming loud and clear a standalone tort of injuries and damages accordingly to the exclusion of damages for constructive dismissal. Otherwise, he should have conducted research or at least reviewed the <EM>WCA Act</EM>, and authorities on constructive dismissal and cases to make certain the claim he was making was valid in law.</P>
<P>81. The Defendant in the within Zinner Action attempted in the course of this trial to misrepresent the facts surrounding Ashraf's complaint as Ashraf having gone to Zinner to seek legal advice about his sickness/injuries and therefore Zinner started a standalone tort for injuries! This is incorrect. The &ldquo;<BOLD>essential character</BOLD>&rdquo; of Ashraf's complaints was loss of employment and/or his constructive dismissal and the manner of his dismissal in abusive conduct of the management team of his employer, the way he was treated under a systematic abusive campaign and series of acts to marginalize, humiliate and frustrate him to the point he would have resigned and left, or the corporation crafted enough evidence to have him terminated. The damages Ashraf incurred as the result of this manner of employer's conducts were obviously discussed with Zinner but it was made very clear at the time when Ashraf had not even heard the legal terminology of constructive or wrongful dismissal that he had been subjected by his employer's management team to uncivilized, fraudulent, deceptive acts as the result of which manner he had lost his health and his job. So those were the discussions Ashraf and Zinner had when Zinner was formulating his opinion. The cause of action for constructive dismissal was not an <BOLD>afterthought</BOLD> solution to revive his action when faced with the WCA defense. This mischaracterization due to Zinner's professional negligence and breaches is <BOLD><UNDER>the stain and stigma</UNDER></BOLD> from which the action suffered to its end and disallowed majority of the claims to advance to trial.</P>
<P>82. The initial advice of Zinner about allegation of constructive dismissal is a clear evidence which he replaced with a Tort of injuries in the guise of being able to receive higher compensations for Ashraf. Likewise the email of Zinner which is in Plaintiff's Exhibit D.62, supports this fact when Zinner sent to Ashraf a statement by one of Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Dickson, who articulated the value of employment as a fundamental contributory element in socially and materially prosperous societies, showing as a matter of assurance that my complaint will be determined to have merits by law depending on the evidence that will be produced.
<P1>[TAB 51]</P1></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>Zinner did not plead the only meritorious cause of action, that is. constructive dismissal</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>83. It is submitted that Zinner's failure to plead the only meritorious cause of action, constructive dismissal, fell below the requisite standard of care.</P>
<P>84. Zinner suggested at Questioning (Transcript July 23, 2015, p 100, II 14-20) that constructive dismissal was in fact sufficiently pled, and that the allegation of constructive dismissal was &ldquo;implied and it is understood, and it should be by any court.&rdquo;</P>
<P>85. The courts did not meet Zinner's expectation that they &ldquo;should&rdquo; discern an implicit plea of constructive dismissal. Master Laycock did not detect such a plea by stating, &ldquo;<EM>Ashraf's employment has not been terminated by the defendant</EM>, <BOLD><EM>nor has Ashraf sued for constructive dismissal as a result of the alleged conduct&rdquo;</EM></BOLD>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v SNC Lavalin ATP Inc</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 143</CITE><PARANUM>4</PARANUM></CASEREF> [TAB 28]</P1></P>
<P>86. Nor did Justice Mahoney detect this ostensibly implicit plea of constructive dismissal:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[...] Mr. Ashraf pleads that he suffered physical injuries, including carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis in his hands and feet, development of peripheral neuropathy, lupus and swelling on his scrotum. He also pleads he suffered from stress, humiliation and distress. Mr. Ashraf seeks damages for the difference between the long-term disability benefits he receives, and his expected salary and benefits had he remained working at SNC, including annual increases, from January 7, 2010 to September 1, 2022, when he reaches 65 years of age. SNC did not terminate Mr. Ashraf</EM>, <BOLD><EM>and Mr. Ashraf does not claim constructive dismissal in the Statement of Claim, as filed</EM></BOLD>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v SNC Lavalin ATP Inc</SOC><CITE>2013 ABQB 688</CITE><PARANUM>6</PARANUM></CASEREF> [TAB 29]</P1></P>
<P>87. In fact, the Court of Appeal held that the SNC Action did not take on the constructive dismissal &ldquo;dimension&rdquo; until the Statement of Claim was amended to expressly plead it:
<QUOTE><P><EM>We take no issue with the chambers judge's decision to allow the amendment to add a claim for constructive dismissal. However</EM>, <BOLD><EM>with that amendment the dispute took on a new dimension</EM></BOLD>. <EM>Although the appellant relies on essentially the same facts, his claim</EM><BOLD><EM>now alleges</EM></BOLD><EM>that workplace harassment</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Work force harassment and bullying pled was by management representing the corporation as a party to the contract.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE><EM>and bullying, tolerated by his employer, marginalized him, caused him stress and physical harm, and eventually compelled him to leave his employment. This, says the appellant, amounted to constructive dismissal</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v SNC Lavalin ATP Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 78</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CASEREF> [TAB 18]</P1></P>
<P>88. Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that Zinner did not, in fact, sufficiently plead constructive dismissal.</P>
<P>89. <BOLD>The second</BOLD> bar in operation at the time as Zinner crafted it, was that the limitation period on personal injuries which <UNDER>arguably</UNDER>, arose when Ashraf became disabled, on or about January 7 of 2010.</P>
<P>90. In short, neither the plain wordings of the <EM>Limitations Act</EM> was understood nor what constitute the trigger of limitation clock in constructive dismissal, he did not advise Ashraf about <UNDER>the existence of high risks and high threshold</UNDER> of pleading disability in limitation arguments, nor did he take any steps at all to have familiarized himself with these extremely basic aspects of procedural law.</P>
<P>91. As noted in Handerek, &ldquo;As for knowledge, a lawyer should know the elementary or fundamental principles of the area in which he or she is providing services, should be able to recognize topics requiring further legal research, and should be able to ascertain the applicable legal rules. A lawyer should be able to perceive legal issues and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of proposed courses of action in light of those issues. A lawyer should recognize his or her limitations and take steps to remedy those limitations to ensure that he or she provides competent service&rdquo;.</P>
<P>92. Limitation periods, the measure of damages, and how and when a cause of action arises, as well as the situations in which an action for personal injuries are barred are &ldquo;<EM>elementary or fundamental principles&rdquo;</EM> as a litigator, even one not claiming to be experienced in employment law, should know.</P>
<P>93. Instead, Zinner told Ashraf that he had an Action for constructive dismissal, but he is late and has passed the deadline as required by the <EM>limitation Act</EM>. Then he told Ashraf, &ldquo;the good news is for people of disability the limitation requirement is suspended&rdquo; allowing the action to proceed unimpeded as long as disability is pled. He treated the matter as a very simple straight forward argument despite the high threshold for such pleading. He then told Ashraf, in any event, constructive dismissal would only provide him with compensation for up to three to six months' salary in lieu of notice according to a law in Alberta (which really does not exist). He advised that he was instead going to file a claim for lost income in &ldquo;tort&rdquo; which should have compensated Ashraf about $5 million in lost wages.</P>
<P>94. Later in his invoices and at the questioning, Zinner stated to have advised Ashraf that he had a concurrent claim in tort and contract which he never told Ashraf at the time. But then such concurrency is the precise prerequisites for <EM>WCA</EM> jurisdictions if dismissal and breach of employment law is not alleged.</P>
<P>95. It is submitted that Zinner knew Ashraf had claims due to tortious conduct of his employer, he should have drafted the Statement of Claim accordingly clearly pleading dismissal in breaches of employment contract law by the corporation and claimed damages arising from the manner thereof and not leave the essential perimeter of constructive dismissal such as dismissal, end of employment, damages in lieu of notice and etc. not pleaded and open for guess work interpretation of the Defendant and the courts which would have naturally free fall jump into <EM>WCA's</EM> jurisdiction.</P>
<P>96. Zinner stated at this trial he had a lingering fear if he had alleged constructive dismissal in the claim, SNC would in retaliation interfered with Ashraf' disability benefits he receive from SunLife. On the other hand, he confirmed under oath his expectation in filing his statement of claim was that the court would have recognized and legitimized the silent cause of action for constructive dismissal for it to continue the litigation. The case would have at any rate been pursued in litigation for a constructive dismissal suit action against SNC whether Zinner alleged constructive dismissal directly in the Statement of claim or the court decreed a cause of action of constructive dismissal. In either case it would have made no difference if SNC was able and could have taken retaliatory steps to interfere with Ashraf disability benefits. When Zinner was confronted with this fact at the trial, he admitted that this fear was &ldquo;futile&rdquo; and meaningless. It is respectfully submitted this is an empty theory, a childish excuse to hide his intention to derail the action but also created <BOLD>the stigma</BOLD> that the <BOLD>essential character</BOLD> the case was injuries at work which disentitled Ashraf from making such claims arising from the manner of his dismissal.</P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER><EM>Zinner did not advise Ashraf that he could amend his Statement of Claim</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>97. It is submitted that, after receiving correspondence from counsel for SNC advising that they would be relying upon the statutory bar in the WCA, Zinner had a duty to advise Ashraf of his legal options. It is specifically submitted that Zinner breached the duties he owed to Ashraf by failing to advise Ashraf that he could amend his Statement of Claim in response to the position taken by SNC.</P>
<P>98. Zinner stated at Questioning and later at the within trial that legal research was necessary before he could provide any legal advice to Ashraf.
<P1>Transcript July 23, 2015, p 10, ll 10&ndash;12 [D.48]</P1></P>
<P>99. However, a competent solicitor should be able to advise the client regarding such basic procedural options as amending one's claim without conducting further research. Indeed, Mr. Newcombe states in his Expert Report that it should have been &ldquo;glaringly obvious&rdquo; that an amendment was the likely next step:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[...] it should, in my opinion, have been glaringly obvious to a reasonably competent barrister and solicitor that the quickest and most effective means of responding to SNC's application to strike the Statement of Claim would be to amend it to include a claim for constructive dismissal. To the extent that senior counsel like Mr. Zinner was not aware that applications to amend a claim are invariably dealt with before an application to strike a claim, even a modicum of inquiry into the matter should have revealed that to him. Further, as no defence had been filed, as noted by Mr. Justice Mahoney, it was open to Mr. Ashraf to amend his pleadings as of right. All of the foregoing would have been brought to Mr. Ashraf's attention by a reasonably competent barrister and solicitor, and the Defendants therefore failed to meet the standard of care expected of them</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><EM>Chad Newcomb Expert Opinion [Court Exhibit #10]</EM></P1></P>
<P>100. Zinner did not do any research before filing the claim when it was absolutely essential and instead relied on his 30 years of experience. But when it came to most procedural step such as amending the Statement of Claim he was no longer relying on his 30 years of litigation experience and took months to do research at the end of which time he advised discontinuing the action. This and so many other contradictory positions of Zinner on various issues is a mask hiding the truth.</P>
<P>101. Zinner admitted at Questioning that he had all but given up on Ashraf at that time because he was &ldquo;difficult, demanding and high-maintenance&rdquo;. However, not only giving up on a client in a manner he did is a breach of his duties but Zinner defamed Ashraf for what is his curiosity and interest is in his case when he was divided and almost demoralized when he heard one thing from Zinner and read something different in his works and when his action went down the drain because of the malevolent indifference of Zinner. This blames and accusation is false and childish and empty excuse to divert his own faults to his client. Moreover
<QUOTE><P><EM>[MR. ASHRAF]: [...] Did you advise Mr. Ashraf that he could amend his statement of claim or you could amend his statement of claim to that of contract as a defence against the application of the defendant</EM>?</P>
<P><EM>[MR. ZINNER]: Let me be perfectly open and clear. First and foremost, I felt that some proper legal research was required in order to properly address the next steps</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Secondly, by this point in time, I was quite conflicted about whether or not I wanted to continue acting for Mr. Ashraf</EM>. <BOLD><EM>I found Mr. Ashraf to be a difficult, demanding and high-maintenance client</EM></BOLD>. <EM>He indicated to me that he no longer wanted to abide by the terms of our contract. He wanted to renegotiate the contract on the basis of terms which I wasn't all that enthusiastic about. I wasn't convinced that Mr. Ashraf had a totally winning case. And so</EM><BOLD><EM>for all of these reasons, I didn't take any more proactive steps on behalf of Mr. Ashraf</EM></BOLD>.</P></QUOTE>
Moreover, the Letter of Mr. Rooney dated April 23, 2018, to Steve Eichler, SNC Lawyer is in reference which is an evidence of misrepresenting the SNC action and the within action in every opportunity.
<P1>Transcript, July 23, 2015, p 116, ll 6&ndash;23 [D.48] [TAB 61]</P1></P>
<P>102. This failure to take &ldquo;any more proactive steps&rdquo; was in breach of the tortious and contractual duties owed to Ashraf. Zinner's duties to his client persisted, regardless of his state of mind regarding the Retainer Agreement. Indeed, Zinner admitted at Questioning that he was aware of his duty to provide legal advice to Ashraf for so long as he continued to be solicitor of record:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[MR. ASHRAF]: So, Mr. Zinner, your failure to get back to me and clearly say what your status is as far as a retainer and our relationship&mdash;the representation relationship is concerned, your failure to get back to me on those terms of revised payment scheme, would that excuse you from providing me proper legal advice, especially when you had told me you will continue to represent me until you make up your mind</EM>?</P>
<P><EM>[MR. ZINNER]: For so long as I continued to be the solicitor of record, I perceived that I had a duty to give you such advice as I could</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Transcript, July 23, 2015, p 118, ll 6&ndash;16, [D.48]</P1></P>
<P>103. Therefore, the Defendants breached their tortious and contractual duties by failing to detect the potential WCA issue, failing to determine the correct limitation period for a constructive dismissal claim, failing to plead the only meritorious cause of action, and by failing to address those errors by properly advising Ashraf of his procedural options in a timely manner or at all.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>C &gt;</EM></N><TI><EM>Summary Zinner's Breaches in Tort and Contract</EM></TI>
<P>104. It is submitted that Zinner's failure to plead the proper and/or all potential, causes of action and his understanding of the limitation issue as well as WCA application in the case was not only negligent, but it was a breach of contract too. The retainer agreement entered into by Ashraf and Zinner clearly contemplates time spent assessing the nature and merits of his possible claims against SNC Lavalin and legal research being conducted in support of this. Clearly, he did not consider the ramifications of bringing one action and not another, and no research into basic procedural steps or limitations law was conducted.</P>
<P>105. In summary, it is submitted that the followings amounted to acts of negligence and/or breach of contract by Zinner but not limited to:
<P1>a. Incorrect application of the plain wording of the <BOLD><EM>Limitations Act</EM></BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>b. Not being aware of when a claim for constructive dismissal arises;</P1>
<P1>c. framing the claim as a standalone tort when he knew, or should have known, that a tort claims for injuries against employers are barred by the <BOLD><EM>WCA Act</EM></BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>d. Failing in basic litigation procedural law as well as the law relevant to the matters he was then advising Ashraf on which required research that never happened before filing the claim;</P1>
<P1>e. Failing to review all the materials provided to him by Ashraf and, without limiting the generality of that, failing to read the medical records and reports provided by Ashraf, such that his legal opinion had to be revised not once, but twice to align his written opinion to what he had told Ashraf earlier in person-to-person discussions;</P1>
<P1>f. Noting the Defendants in default after they had served him with a summary judgment application within the negotiated limitation time,</P1>
<P1>g. Failing to advise Ashraf of meaningful strategy to move the action forward when faced with the summary judgment application for a lengthy period of several weeks during which he was considering whether or not to continue to act for Ashraf; and</P1>
<P1>h. Instead of amending the Statement of Claim when the pleadings were still open, he advised Ashraf to withdraw from the action,</P1>
<P1>i. Receiving payment in full satisfaction of his invoices without any objections and follow up and later reneging it when terminated,</P1>
<P1>j. In general, conduct tantamount to obstruction of justice by incorrect legal advice and incorrect framing of the cause of action in the statement of claim.</P1></P>
<P>106. A similar list is in [TAB 1] with most breaches in different categories showing relevant Plaintiff's Exhibit numbers.</P>
<P>107. It is further submitted that none of the above acts of negligence and breach of contract amount to &ldquo;mere errors in judgment.&rdquo; They do not represent simple mistakes, they indicate negligence if not deliberate harm, when he had the foreknowledge of the <EM>WCA</EM> constraints or at least lack of knowledge of the subject area that Zinner had told Ashraf he knew, a lack of willingness to do research or make enquiries into the merits of the proposed claim; a failure to review materials the client had provided him, then stating that the absence of such materials would be fatal to the claim (first and second drafts of his opinion letter) and, overall, an attitude of callousness if not sabotage of the Action. When alerted, Zinner did not correct his mistakes and instead was chasing Ashraf in several court hearings for payment in lieu of work which not only was of no value but fundamentally damaged Ashraf's claim paralyzing his life and well-being due to the added pain and suffering upon him. Before filing the Action, Zinner claimed the action was to progress unimpeded but when faced with opposition of the Defendant on the ground of WCA bar, he looked as if he never knew anything about it, as if his 30 years of experience upon which he relied not to do any research before filing the action had vanished and he refrained from giving obvious procedural legal advice and said he had to conduct research. He should have done the research before filing which he did not do and once he finished his research in October 2012, he asked Ashraf to discontinue the action if barred!</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>IV - III.</N><TI>The Defendants are liable for Plaintiff's suffering and damages resulting from Breaches of their Tortious and contractual duties</TI>
<P>108. Damages caused by Zinner are not limited to financial damages. In its essential character and foundational nature, it has had paralyzing effect on Ashraf's life, adversely affecting him, his family, social reputations and relationships bringing scores of wrongs upon him adding significantly many folds more pain and suffering upon a person who was suffering of the abuse he underwent in his employment.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>A &gt;</EM></N><TI><EM>The Defendants' breaches caused the Plaintiff to undertake significant litigation to restore the dead SNC action and revive some of its claims</EM></TI>
<P>109. Had it not been for professional negligence of Zinner, the extent of litigation work carried out to repair his damages were absolutely unnecessary. The SNC Action Zinner negligently filed was aborted by two bars. <BOLD>First bar</BOLD> was based on section 21 of the <EM>WCA Act</EM>, which took more than five years of litigation to correct some of the damages, finally the dead action was restored, and some of its claims revived before it could have advanced to trial. The <BOLD>second bar</BOLD> was due to the <EM>Limitation Act</EM> which placed Ashraf in a position based on legal advice of his lawyer at the time (not Zinner) not to proceed to trial due to high risk of losing the limitation argument which has very high threshold when its suspension was pled due to disability. The Action was therefore resolved by settlement in November 2017 just days before the trial when Ashraf was experiencing multiple anxiety attack from the stressful shocks of the advice for not proceeding to trial, for not having a lawyer at the trial, leading to convulsion and high fever and hospitalization in the days and weeks before the starting date of the trial. Dr. Thomas's letter with attachments of consult notes from the hospital is in Exhibit #7 of the trial court.</P>
<P>110. If Zinner was not negligent: the claim in its entirety would have not been dismissed three times based on WCA Bar by a master and two Justices including the Case Management Judge (CMJ), major parts of claim for damages with respect to loss of earning capacity and defamation would have not been dismissed by the CMJ and the Appeal Court based on the same law in the <EM>WCA Act</EM> of Alberta, which is inapplicable to the cause of action in the amended Statement of Claim. Ashraf would have not gone to the Appeal Court twice, he would have not gone through two summary judgement Applications, he would have not had to start a second Action (1301-05536) to mitigate the risk of not being able to restore the action Zinner started, and he would have not been disallowed from advancing to trial major parts of the claim for pecuniary damages for wage loss beyond notice period and defamation. If it was not because of Zinner's mistake in limitation time, Ashraf would have not had to settle in an amount for next to nothing. If Zinner was not negligent Ashraf, would have not had to go through two other Zinner's actions either of 1201-15851 and 1401-03230 to deal with breaches of Zinner that ruined Ashraf's life.</P>
<P>111. If Zinner started the action properly <UNDER>none of the above primary and secondary steps were necessary</UNDER>. The Expert Opinion of Mr. Newcomb as well as those lawyers who had worked on my file or whom I intended to hire but could not afford them to represent me trial have said this in <UNDER>unequivocal language</UNDER>.</P>
<BLOCK5><N><EM>i</EM></N><TI><EM>Litigation required to restore the dead action and some of its claims</EM></TI>
<P>112. After termination of Zinner, Ashraf was advised by other lawyers that the solution for moving the action forward was amending to constructive dismissal. He was told when he was in front of the master, he should seek leave to amend his claim.</P>
<P>113. The claim Zinner drafted in Action 1201-09737, was struck by master Laycock in a summary judgement application brought by SNC Lavalin. While Ashraf pled constructive dismissal before master Laycock at the hearing on February 14, 2013, as shown in his decision which is in [TAB 28], master Laycock, identified the pleadings are similar to those of constructive dismissal, but he did not treat the case as such because neither constructive dismissal was alleged nor damages for the same were claimed, termination of Ashraf's employment in mid-2011 was not pled and as such he could have not and did not make that assumption based on the Statement of Claim before him because there is a very fine line between jurisdiction of WCA Board of Alberta and the court of Queen's Bench in such matters and that is whether constructive dismissal is alleged or not. Without such direct allegations the court cannot make assumption for the plaintiff unless the Plaintiff make it clear in the claim or on records by amendments. Sentences 1 and 2 of Paragraph 24 of his decision are in reference.
<P1>[TAB 28]</P1></P>
<P>114. According to the SCC, the fact is that even in concurrent causes of action for Breach of Contract and an independent tort of injuries which after the fact Zinner claimed to have been the causes of action he filed, would fail the test unless the claim for injuries (pecuniary damages) is pled to have arisen from the manner of dismissal in context of tortious acts and/or intentional infliction of mental suffering. In other words, the only time a tort of injuries in employer and employee relationship can survive under common law is <BOLD>when the tortious conduct occurs as part of the manner of dismissal</BOLD> which need to first prove the grounds for constructive dismissal as a breach in contract and then tort of injuries a function thereof.
<P1><EM>y</EM> = <EM>f</EM>(<EM>x</EM>) [TAB 53]</P1></P>
<P>115. That if x is constructive dismissal and y is tort of injuries, a tort of injuries is a function of constructive dismissal in the context of employment law. A trot of injuries, y, cannot exist on its own unless it is a function or arise from x, the manner of constructive dismissal. This fact will be shown later in the context of case law.</P>
<P>116. Ashraf appealed the decision of master to the Justice Chamber and based on ruling of master Laycock from the Bench, Ashraf filed an Application seeking permission to amend the Statement of Claim to be heard at the same time as the appeal. While waiting for the appeal hearing, Ashraf started a new action 1301-05536 with a cause of action for constructive dismissal to mitigate the risk if the appeal of the action Zinner started was not granted.</P>
<P>117. However, the SNC brought an Application filed on May 24<SUP>th</SUP>, 2013, (TAB 41.1.4 of the Plaintiff Book of Exhibits) of amended Record of Pleadings) to the master chamber seeking dismissal of the new action 1301-05536 on the ground that the new action's pleadings are similar to the earlier 1201-09737, action dismissed by master Laycock. This resulted in master Mason's decision and on appeal in J/ Anderson's decision to adjourn the Application and to halt the litigation of the new action until the outcome of appeal from master's Laycock decision is known.
<P1>[TAB 60]</P1></P>
<P>118. On appeal of master Laycock's decision, Mahoney J/ dismissed the appeal in his decision and stated the &ldquo;<BOLD>essential character</BOLD>&rdquo; of the claim was injuries and not constructive dismissal, that the injuries fit the definition of WCA's &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, and that he would have dismissed the sample amended statement of claim with cause of action for constructive dismissal if it had been filed.</P>
<P>119. In his decision Mr. J/ Mahoney stated that Ashraf had a claim for <EM>WCA</EM>. Ashraf did not start a claim with <EM>WCA</EM> because due to familiarity of Ashraf with his evidence which remained unexamined on a Summary Judgement Application:
<P1>a. It would have been tantamount to perversion and perjury to pretend what happened to Ashraf was an &ldquo;<EM>accident</EM>&rdquo; which must have happened as part of &ldquo;<EM>Normal insured activities of employment</EM>&rdquo; and the cause was &ldquo;<EM>inherent hazard of employment</EM>&rdquo;, which were not the case. Several lawyers including Zinner who had examined Ashraf's evidence had told Ashraf he had a cause of action for constructive dismissal because the corporation itself as a legal entity represented by its management team were directly involved in orchestrating or condoning the abusive systematic campaign of dismissal and therefore the corporation was vicariously liable for not protecting Ashraf from the damages he sustained and the WCA insurance would have not had jurisdiction over the case.</P1>
<P1>b. <EM>WCA</EM> is not equipped nor has jurisdiction to deal with civil matters such as breaches of employment contract law, constructive dismissal and civil cases in general. It would have been a long, painful and wasteful process at the end of which to return to the civil action at the court of Queen's Bench at which time Ashraf would have definitely been out of time to pursue litigation for a new action.</P1>
<P1>c. Moreover, both Ashraf and his employer had passed the limitation time for reporting an accident to the <EM>WCA</EM> of Alberta according to sections 26(l)(a) and 33(l)(b)(i) of the <EM>WCA Act</EM>. The penalty in order of thousands of Dollars for any such reporting application, if accepted, had to be made by the employer and employee as per section 152(2)(a), (b) of the <EM>WCA Act</EM>. This was obviously beyond Ashraf's level of affordability particularly when research had shown it be a futile exercise, and Ashraf had no control over his employer to force them to pay the fees,</P1>
<P1>d. Shepell, which was a consultant to SNC Lavalin for medical screenings and services did not find <EM>WCA</EM> to have any jurisdiction in the matter and advised Ashraf and SNC early in 2010, to apply to Sun Life financial and receive disability benefits. In 2013 and 2014, when the above decisions were made by master Laycock and J/ Mahoney, Ashraf had already been receiving such benefits for 4 years and approved till age 65 unless he was able to return to work.</P1></P>
<P>120. Ashraf appealed the decision of Mahoney J/ to the Appeal Court of Alberta and while he was waiting for the appeal hearing at the Appeal Court, he filed an amended Statement of Claim in action 1201-09737, <BOLD>on June 2, 2014</BOLD>, with a cause of action for constructive dismissal based on the rule of court 3.62(l)(a), articulated by J/ Mahoney when he dismissed the Application of the Plaintiff seeking permission for amendment. This rule of court allowed amendment without permission so long as the pleadings were not closed.</P>
<P>121. However, upon the responding Application of the Defendant, the amended statement of claim in action 1201 plus an Application of Ashraf for consolidation of actions 1201 and 1301 were dismissed by Anderson J/ on the grounds that action 1201 was dead as it was dismissed previously and filing an amended statement of claim should have not even been permitted by the clerk of the court. The Order is in item 11 of the Record of Pleadings.</P>
<P>122. The appeal of the decision of Mr. J/ Mahoney, was heard by the Appeal Court and its decision was released after which the corresponding Order was issued and filed on April 29, 2015. It dismissed the decision of Mahoney J/ who had disallowed the amendment. Also, the decision of Anderson J/ who had dismissed the June 2, 2014, amended claim in SNC Action, 1201, was dismissed by the AC. The AC specifically noted that Ashraf can advance his claim for constructive dismissal, including those parts of the claim seeking damages caused by stress arising from constructive dismissal by the employer. Para 11 and 12 of the decision in TAB 18 are in reference. The Order of the Appeal Court is in item 12 of the Record of Pleadings.</P>
<P>123. Justice Anderson, CMJ, issued an Order on March 17 (Apr 4), 2016, allowing SNC a Special Justice Chamber hearing before end of September 2016, for an unfiled summary judgement Application. Although the ruling from the Bench included the matter of early service of SJ Application and SJ Affidavit to give Ashraf ample time in summer to retain lawyer, to question SNC on their SJ Affidavit and prepare his own Affidavit and Brief of Argument; the Order did not include dates for filing and service of SJ materials. SNC did not fulfill its commitment to file the SJ materials on time by or before end of April 2016 but filed and served the same three months later. Ashraf could not get an adjournment and as the result the SJ hearing proceeded without a response to the grounds for the remedies sought by SNC. More details are summarized in Tab 59.
<P1>[TAB 59]</P1></P>
<P>124. Had Ashraf been given the appropriate allotted time to prepare his response, major parts of his claims would have not been dismissed and at worst the matter would have been referred to the upcoming trial scheduled for November 2017. The Facts and evidence of the action were not the grounds for dismissal of the claim for injuries which arose from the cause of action for constructive dismissal in the amended St. of Claim filed on June 2, 2014. The dismissal was based on the decision of master Laycock, who summarily dismissed the standalone tort of injuries in February 2013. The WCA bar in section 21 of the Act should have not and could have not been applied to damages arising in the manner of a cause of action for constructive dismissal, but so happened due to the <BOLD>stigma</BOLD> attached to the action due to negligence of Zinner, that the &ldquo;essential character&rdquo; of the claim was injuries and constructive dismissal was an <BOLD>afterthought</BOLD> loophole Ashraf found to save the action.</P>
<P>125. On appeal of Summary Judgement decision of the CMJ dated September 27, 2016, the Appeal Court upheld the decision except her decision for pay in lieu of notice which was set aside to be decided at the trial. The detailed analysis of this decision is out of the scope of this Brief however it is included in TAB 39 for reference.</P>
<P>126. In para [28] of its 2017 decision, the AC justified that the ground for dismissal by the CMJ, of the claim for injuries must be seen in the context of its <BOLD>&ldquo;historical proceedings&rdquo;,</BOLD> which was none other but the decision of master Laycock in applying WCA jurisdiction to the action Zinner started. While WCA has nothing to do with a cause of action for constructive dismissal case and damages arising therefrom whether pecuniary or none-pecuniary, it was applied to the new cause of action due to the <BOLD>taint</BOLD> in the SNC action caused by Zinner. In other words, had it not been for the professional negligence of Zinner who derailed the action in the wrong direction, it would have not suffered I from the <BOLD>stigma</BOLD> attached to the action that the <BOLD>essential character</BOLD> of the action was injuries, that the new cause of action was an <BOLD>afterthought</BOLD> loophole Ashraf crafted to save his action and etc.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v SNC Lavalin ATP Inc.</SOC><CITE>2017 ABCA 95</CITE></CASEREF> [TAB 19]</P1></P>
<P>127. Moreover, in para [30] of the same decision, the Appeal Court stated they were satisfied the case management judge did not have sufficient evidence before her to make a just determination on the merits. More importantly, perhaps, they saw very little judicial economy in making this decision before trial as the court will be required to determine whether there was any unjust dismissal.</P>
<P>128. While none of the courts had examined the truth and validity of the evidence in the SNC Action, it is more than clear in this action and in this court that the essential character of SNC action as testified in writings and in oral testimonies of Zinner, was constructive dismissal. To this Ashraf's lawyer in 2017, who examined all the facts and evidence testified too. Moreover, the independent expert opinion advised the same that were it not for the professional negligence of Zinner the true cause of action would have not been obscured under the guise of tort of injuries and the action would have progressed unimpeded similar to tens and hundreds of constructive dismissal actions some which will be shown hereunder that claimed damages and were compensated for loss of earning capacity resulting from the tortious manner of dismissal.</P>
<P>129. It is more than obvious that every Application, every appeal, every step taken in the SNC action as well as the within action had been of absolute necessity for Ashraf to restore the action and its claims which would have been allowed by law to advance to trial had it not been for the conscious wrongs and gross negligence of Zinner.</P>
<P>130. It is submitted, had Zinner started action 1201-09737, properly pled constructive dismissal and claimed for notice period and damages arising from the manner of dismissal such as defamations, loss of earning capacity to reengage in employment and thereby wage loss beyond notice period till at least age 65, due to stress; the action would have not suffered from damages that stained it to the end and Ashraf would have been allowed, as will be shown in the following authorities, to advance to trial all damages and not be limited to Aggravated and punitive damages which are the rubric for general none-pecuniary intangible emotional damages and limited with historical cap of $200 K in constructive dismissal cases.</P>
<P>131. The SCC has outlined in <CASEREF><SOC>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</SOC></CASEREF>, which was adjudicated several years before Zinner filed a statement of Claim for Ashraf, the principles for constructive dismissal and damages flowing from it which as of this date is still the leading authority in causes of action for constructive dismissal.</P>
<P>132. The law relating to damages for <BOLD>mental distress and intentional infliction of mental suffering</BOLD> arising from wrongful or constructive dismissal context is seen in the line of decisions stemming from <CASEREF><SOC>Wallace v. United Grain Growers</SOC><CITE>[1997] 3 S.C.R. 701</CITE></CASEREF>, as explained by <CASEREF><SOC>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</SOC></CASEREF>, in paragraphs 55 to 59, which are reviewed herein. ...
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 39</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(CanLII)</EM>, in paragraphs 55 to 59 [TAB 20]</P1></P>
<P>133. It is submitted that the above reviewed excerpts establish the following principles: Wholly apart from damages in lieu of notice, other losses arising from the manner in which the employee was dismissed (not from the dismissal itself) are compensable if, at the time the employment contract was entered into, such losses were contemplated: Wallace, Honda, et seq., &ldquo;<EM>Damages attributable to conduct in the manner of dismissal are always to be awarded under the</EM><BOLD><EM>Hadley principle</EM></BOLD><EM>&rdquo; Honda, at para. [59]. That principle is that damages are recoverable for a contractual breach if the damages are &ldquo;such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally ... from such breach of contract itself or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of parties.&rdquo;, Honda, at para [55]</EM></P>
<P>134. At least since <BOLD><EM>Wallace</EM></BOLD><EM>(1997)</EM> and <BOLD><EM>Fidler</EM></BOLD><EM>(1854)</EM>, the law has recognized that both parties to an employment contract have an expectation that an employer will be civil, reasonable, honest and forthright, and otherwise act in good faith, in the course of a dismissal of the employee. Failure to act in accordance with this expectation lead accordingly to foreseeable and compensable damages, and therefore damages arising from such failure fall under the <BOLD><EM>Hadley</EM></BOLD> principle. Such damages should be awarded in a manner that reflects the &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>ACTUAL</EM></BOLD>&rdquo; damage sustained: <EM>Honda</EM>, para. 59.</P>
<P>135. There is nothing, in law or in the evidence, to suggest that Ashraf's constructive dismissal claim is limited to a claim for damages in lieu of notice, or that he is otherwise unable to seek damages, arising from the manner of his dismissal whether pecuniary or none-pecuniary, for mental distress or any other similar consequential losses recognized as a head of damage in constructive dismissal.</P>
<P>136. It is without saying that majority of resignations or terminations are stressful as job changes even when not in bad faith and for better are not without stress how much more if unemployment or injuries due to bad faith is accompanied in a termination or resignation. But damages due to stress in claims arising from the manner by which an employee is constructively dismissed are especially compensable when proven that the manner was in violation of duty of good faith and duty of care by employer and through intentional infliction of mental suffering to force the employee out of employment while damaging his health, reputations, or damaging his economic interests and etc.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd</SOC><CITE>[1997] 3 SCR 701</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>1997 CanLII 332</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <EM>at para. 95</EM>., [TAB 55]</P1></P>
<P>137. The following authorities clearly demonstrate by differentiation what is meant by a claim for damages due to stress in wrongful or constructive dismissal case.</P>
<P>138. The case of <CASEREF><SOC>Piresferreira v. Ayotte</SOC><CITE>2008 canlii67418</CITE></CASEREF>, is a good precedence for the case of Ashraf versus SNC for damages arising from the manner of his dismissal. The employee alleged constructive dismissal and damages due to stress arising from the manner thereof. The court awarded her among other damages payment with respect to proper notice as well as wage loss till age 65, due to loss of capacity to reengage in work which resulted from the stress in the manner of her constructive dismissal.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Piresferreira v. Ayotte</SOC><CITE>2008 canlii67418</CITE></CASEREF>, [TAB 45]</P1></P>
<P>139. On appeal, the wage loss award was dismissed not on the ground that the law does not allow it but on the ground that her evidence was insufficient to support her claim for Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering (IIMS). The Appeal court stated that there was well established and recorded investigation at Bell Mobility, the supervisor at fault who was the cause of stress was subjected to disciplinary action, the supervisor had to write a formal letter of apology to the wronged employee with copy to HR in addition to an in-person apology at a meeting with the HR. The employer assigned the employee, Piresferreira to a different supervisor. The employer transferred the abusive supervisor to a different location in the company to avoid encounters. The Appeal court in their decision stated based on all these facts the employer had done everything possible to accommodate the employee which showed lack of intent on the part of the corporation to give rise to intentional infliction of mental suffering.</P>
<P>140. In Ashraf's case there was no investigation at the time and no records was even produced during its litigation, absolutely nothing in his HR file not even a copy of three months disciplinary action and warning in the form of PIP, (The Performance Improvement Plan, which is in Ashraf's Book of Exhibit, Exhibit #D.8) and the accusation therein were not supported by any facts and evidence at the time and nothing was produce from his HR file and nothing in the cross examinations of SNC officers but purely acts of intimidation, bullying, marginalization, humiliation and etc.</P>
<P>141. There are several evidences of Ashraf's communications before his complete disability to the management team that how the stress born of abusive systematic campaign (planned, intentional) is causing him sickness. One is an email which is in Plaintiff Book of Exhibit #D.66 from Ashraf to his director of Engineering G. Brook a couple of months before his total disability. Not only the management did not take any steps to investigate the issues, they worsened their systematic intentional approach of forcing him out with another 2009-year end negative performance review given to him on Jan 6, 2010, till eventually he collapsed in complete sickness due to ungrounded and unjustified false accusations one after another. A year later, when Ashraf wrote to the employer expressing his willingness to take part in gradual return to work plan, initiated by Sun Life, the employer did not even respond.</P>
<P>142. The pile of evidence specially what has been gathered is overwhelming beyond a shadow of doubt, to support all the allegations Ashraf had brought to court, and there has to be an opportunity in the trial within trial to unburden justice from its obstruction.</P>
<P>143. Another popular case to cite with respect to claims for loss of income beyond notice period which had arisen from constructive dismissal, <CASEREF><SOC>Boucher v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 419</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(CanLII)</EM>, in which the same law is shown in its paragraphs [102&ndash;105]. ...
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Boucher v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp.</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 419</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(CanLII)</EM>, [TAB 46]</P1></P>
<P>144. In <CASEREF><SOC>Silvera v. Olympia Jewellery</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3760</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(CanLII)</EM>, the young employee who was found constructively dismissed was awarded wage loss in addition and beyond pay for proper notice period until her full recovery which lasted for about three years till she was able to reengage in work.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Silvera v. Olympia Jewellery</SOC><CITE>2015 ONSC 3760</CITE></CASEREF> <EM>(CanLII)</EM>, [TAB 47]</P1></P>
<P>145. In <CASEREF><SOC>Potter v. New Brunsswick LAS</SOC><CITE>2015scc10</CITE><PAGENUM>pages 501, 501</PAGENUM><PARANUM>[21] and [27]</PARANUM></CASEREF> of [TAB 21], which is another case of precedence derived from <CASEREF><SOC>Honda v. Keays</SOC></CASEREF>, the SCC upheld the decisions of the lower courts which went back several years before 2012, and clearly stated that determination of constructive dismissal in common law need not formal resignation or termination....
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Potter v. New Brunsswick LAS</SOC><CITE>2015scc10</CITE></CASEREF>, [TAB 21]</P1></P>
<P>146. However, in the case at bar, Ashraf had informed SNC and Sun Life after repeated attempts seeking resolution which remained without response that he was not going to return to his employment at SNC. The evidences of these facts are in memos and emails Ashraf sent to the senior management of SNC which are Plaintiff's Exhibit D.8. Also, a letter of Ashraf's physician, Dr. Thomas to Sun Life dated August 30, 2011, which is in Plaintiff's Exhibit D.8.10 med/SL, informing Sun Life and SNC that Ashraf is not returning to work for SNC.</P>
<P>147. The SCC had also articulated the law in terms of what constitutes wrongful constructive dismissal in the same case of <CASEREF><SOC>Potter v. New Brunsswick</SOC></CASEREF> LAS <BOLD>2015</BOLD>scc10: Page 502, Para 2:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Constructive dismissal can take two forms: that of a single unilateral act that breaches an essential term of the contract, or that of a series of acts that, taken together, show that the employer intended to no longer be bound by the contract</EM>.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>148. In the SNC action it is clear that any excuses by Zinner for not having alleged constructive dismissal for lack of formal termination/resignation or a single event one which by itself is considered a unilateral act in breach of the employment contract is indefensible: as series of intentional and unilateral acts of SNC in their abusive systematic campaign from 2007 to 2010, when taken together, show that SNC intended to no longer be bound by the employment contract. Not withstanding that many single acts of SNC on its own constitute a breach of contract and ground for constructive dismissal.</P>
<P>149. Ashraf however had a duty as an employee to mitigate his losses and continued working while protesting violations of terms of his contract and the abusive conduct of SNC hoping for improvements. However the more resilience Ashraf demonstrated in bringing to attention of the management the operational mismanagement and abusive behavior of his supervisor and his team and to clear any possible misunderstanding, the worst and more vehement became the abusive campaign orchestrated and/or condoned by the senior management to force him out of employment or construct and craft enough evidence which in reality were false but to the onlookers may have seemed as justified to have Ashraf terminated. SNC succeeded as they knew full well Ashraf had become very sick with diagnosis of auto immune disease and lupus in September 2009, the cause of which was communicated to the management to have been stress arising from the abusive conducts of his supervisor and the senior management of the corporation. SNC Exhibit entered as 1401 Exhibit D.66, is in reference which is one of the evidences in an email dated Nov 2009.</P>
<P>150. As also shown in <CASEREF><SOC>Prinzo v. Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care</SOC><CITE>2002 CanLII 45005</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, actionable wrongs resulting in injuries must arise from clearly pled cause of Action for constructive dismissal. On its own as a standalone tort similar to Zinner's framing, without directly alleging constructive dismissal would fall under jurisdiction of <EM>WCA</EM> and barred accordingly.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Prinzo v. Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care</SOC><CITE>2002 CanLII 45005</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [TAB 48]</P1></P>
<P>151. It is submitted the work performed by Zinner on behalf of Ashraf was performed with conscious gross negligence, in breach of contract, in breach of fiduciary duty, in breach of duty of care, in breach of code of ethics of the law society, in breach of client's trust. And as a result, not only Ashraf suffered financial losses, but his health worsened losing any chance of recovery and remission during the earlier period of his disease when he was placed on disability to find an opportunity for recuperation and recovery.</P>
<P>152. Incorrect legal advice is causative of damage if it is the &ldquo;direct, immediate and logical cause&rdquo; in pursuing a particular course of conduct. Causation is not severed by receiving a second legal opinion, even if that opinion is incorrect:

<P>153. The above passage directly contradicts the Defendants' contention that the subsequent legal advice obtained by Ashraf breaks the chain of causation, or that Ashraf was somehow the author of his own misfortune.</P>
<P>154. Despite his reluctance, Ashraf was hands-on during the drafting of Zinner's opinion or the Statement Claim to the degree of synchronizing Zinner's earlier legal advice he gave Ashraf in person to what he wrote in his letters or the events and transactions which he had told Ashraf he was to plead in the claim but were not shown in his drafts. Ashraf had no part whatsoever in formulating the law, cause of action or legal pleadings. However, it is submitted that a lawyer has a duty of competence that applies equally to every client, whether &ldquo;high-maintenance&rdquo; or not. Further, Ashraf's approval of the Statement of Claim was premised upon the Defendants' faulty legal opinion, including his incorrect assumption about the limitation date applicable to a constructive dismissal claim and his failure to advise Ashraf of the existence of the <EM>WCA</EM> bar.
<P1>Transcript of Questioning of Shidan Ashraf, July 21, 2015, p 16, ll 4&ndash;11 [D.48]</P1></P>
<P>155. As argued in the above parts, Zinner breached the requisite standard of care and the Retainer Agreement by failing to plead constructive dismissal in the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>156. The Defendants contend that Ashraf obtained legal advice that advised him that he could amend his claim, and the Defendants are not responsible for Ashraf's failure to follow that advice. This position is legally indefensible in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's holding in <CASEREF><SOC>Dorion v Roberge</SOC></CASEREF>, <EM>supra</EM>, cited above at paragraph 151. Further, despite this advice, Ashraf remained unaware that he could amend without leave, or while the application to strike was pending. Even Master Laycock appeared to be under the misapprehension that pleadings were closed:
<QUOTE><P><EM>[MR. ASHRAF]: [...] I asked [Master Laycock] to allow me to amend my statement of claim to constructive dismissal. He told me to bring an application and take permission because he has&mdash;is dismissing the case. And so I brought an application which was heard by subsequent hearing</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Transcript of Questioning of Shidan Ashraf, July 21, 2015, p 40, ll 10&ndash;15 [D.48]</P1></P>
<P>157. Consequently, at a minimum, the steps taken arose out of Zinner's inadequate legal analysis and incorrect legal advice.</P>
<P>158. However, even after the constructive dismissal claim was added, Justice Mahoney held that the statutory bar under the <EM>WCA</EM> also removed that cause of action:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Mr. Ashraf's claim for damages for constructive dismissal in his draft Amended Statement of Claim arises out of the same allegations of systemic abuse, harassment and bullying, and the amendments relate to the same series of events. Adding a claim for constructive dismissal in these circumstances does not alter my conclusion that Mr. Ashraf's allegations fall under the definition of &ldquo;accident&rdquo; for the purpose of workers' compensation</EM>.</P></QUOTE>

<P>159. The Court of Appeal, in reversing Justice Mahoney's decision, noted that this error arose out of the learned Justice's interpretation of the WCA Act which is not applicable to physical or psychological injuries due to stress arising from the SNC Action in the manner of Ashraf's dismissal.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ashraf v SNC Lavalin ATP Inc</SOC><CITE>2015 ABCA 78</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF> [TAB 18]</P1></P>
<P>160. Zinner's negligent characterization of the SNC Action poisoned the well to such an extent that it overshadowed the &ldquo;essential character&rdquo; of the SNC Action, even after constructive dismissal was expressly pled. A second look by the Court of Appeal was required which provided further clarifications on the claims of constructive dismissal but due to the <BOLD>stigma</BOLD> attached to the SNC action caused by Zinner's negligence, it was deterred from providing the remedies provisioned by the SCC to constructive dismissal actions which started properly in their true cause of action with damages pled accordingly.</P></BLOCK5>

<P>162. In particular, legal costs are recoverable when they were incurred by the Plaintiff while taking the proper legal steps to mitigate his damages, even when the steps taken were ultimately fruitless:
<QUOTE><P><EM>In my view these were costs properly incurred by the plaintiff in endeavouring to preserve his action and its failure to do so would have permitted the defendants herein to claim he did not take appropriate steps to mitigate his damages.

<P>163. Consequently, it is submitted that Zinner is liable for all the litigation work and resulting losses. The work done was absolutely essential to restore the dead action and repair and revive its claim to the extent possible. These damages resulted directly from Zinner's professional negligence and breach of his contract and the extent of all the work would have been unnecessary if Zinner started the action properly in the correct cause of Action.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>

<P>166. The fact that the Plaintiff was ill prior to retaining Zinner does not relieve Zinner of liability. The law does not excuse a defendant from liability merely because other causal factors for which he is not responsible also helped produce the harm. This principle applies to any case in which the injuries caused by a number of factors are indivisible.

<P>168. The Defendants had committed as part of condition of their retainer to provide legal service which were to be as seamless as possible to the Plaintiff due to conditions of his health. The Defendants were clearly aware of Ashraf's susceptibility to stress and anxiety, and the impact that stress has on his physical and mental wellbeing. It was reasonably foreseeable that imposing undue stress on Ashraf would occasion physical and mental injury.</P>
<P>169. Causation of Ashraf disabilities is established in various medical expert opinion reports and letters entered as evidence in the Trial Court Exhibit #7. It is caused by undue stress in the manner of dismissal of Ashraf and Zinner's professional negligence in prolonged years of pain and suffering while salvaging the SNC Action which has directly contributed to exacerbation and worsening of Ashraf's physical and psychological health.</P>
<P>170. The opinion of psychiatrist Dr. Asha Nair supports the conclusion that the Defendants' breaches directly caused Ashraf's ongoing issues with anxiety:
<QUOTE><P><EM>Overall, Mr. Ashraf seems to have struggled both from physical and mental health perspective [sic] due to ongoing stressors and pressures of going through a litigation process. [...]</EM></P>
<P><EM>Overall, my impression of Mr. Ashraf's mental health remains the same in that he has continued to experience symptoms of anxiety that initially was triggered and maintained by work related stressors and, over the last few years, due to the stressors of dealing with the legal system, especially as a self-represented litigant</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Report of Dr. Asha Nair dated April 12, 2018 [Court Exhibit #7]</P1></P>
<P>171. The opinion of rheumatologist Dr. Dianne Mosher confirmed that Ashraf's increased stress while undertaking the SNC Action aggravated his psoriatic arthritis:
<QUOTE><P><EM>At the request of Mr. Ashraf, I have agreed to provide further information on his condition of psoriatic arthritis and the relationship of his disease to the ongoing stress of litigation.... Mr. Ashraf was referred to me by Dr. Jibb upon her retirement. I originally saw Mr. Ashraf on June 29, 2015. ... He has required aggressive therapy this has only partially controlled his disease.... In my expert opinion, I believe that the undue stress Mr. Ashraf has been under has contributed to the severity and progression of his psoriatic arthritis. In addition, this has affected his emotional wellbeing</EM>.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Report of Dr. Dianne Mosher dated Feb 6, 2019 [Court Exhibit #7]</P1></P>
<P>172. She also shown through the laboratory test results in her letter of October 15, 2018, as well as the above-mentioned letter that the undue stress caused by the litigation over the years has made many different medications she has tried on Ashraf, ineffective. These are medications used to control and bring about remission, but Ashraf still has significant internal inflammation including in his joints, skin and nervous system which are attributed to continued stress of the litigation. Not only Ashraf could not benefit from the medication due to ongoing stress of the litigation, but he has to suffer from the adverse side effects of the same in addition to the symptoms of his disease. The most manifest and simplest of the side effects is weakening of the immune system by design which make Ashraf extremely susceptible to infections.</P>
<P>173. In his Medical Expert Opinion Reports and subsequent letters expressing the same, <BOLD>Dr. Thomas</BOLD> who was a practicing physician in family medicine and also a professor at the medical school of UOC involved in highly advanced research, stated clearly that <UNDER>undue stress</UNDER> at work and <UNDER>prolonged litigation as self-represented litigant</UNDER>, had been primary contributing factor in causation, worsening and exacerbation of Ashraf's physical and psychological disease, including depression, post traumatic syndromes and anxiety disorder which based on scientific analysis he presented at the trial as a witness, not only have crippling effect on one's life causing much pain and suffering but shorten the life of patients by years.</P>
<P>174. There is also a consult note for a visit in 2009, in Exhibits # D.8, with Ashraf's dermatologist specialist physician, Dr. Storwick, in which note he diagnosed Ashraf's Lupus and stated it was caused by stress which had played a role in his disease.</P>
<P>175. It goes without saying if a person is suffering from smoke inhalation, not only the patient is treated for the same but the fire causing the smoke has to be put out otherwise no remedy can heal the symptoms while the causation actively continues.</P>
<P>176. It was reasonably foreseeable that Ashraf would suffer mental distress and an aggravation of his physical symptoms when forced to make nearly two dozen court applications as a direct result of his lawyer's negligence.</P>
<P>177. As a result of the Defendants' breaches, Ashraf was left financially incapable of retaining a lawyer to take care of the SNC Action on his behalf, and instead had to represent himself while obtaining piecemeal legal assistance.
<P1>Transcript of Questioning of Shidan Ashraf, July 21, 2015, p 35 l 14 - p 36, l 17 [D.46]</P1></P>
<P>178. By the time Ashraf terminated the Retainer Agreement, he had already paid thousands of dollars in legal fees to the Defendants. Ashraf was, and continues to be, relying on long term disability benefits for income. Spending thousands of dollars by gambling on another lawyer simply was not an option.
<P1>Transcript of Continued Questioning of Shidan Ashraf, December 16, 2015, p 81, l 17 - p 82, l 2 [D.46]</P1></P>
<P>179. Ashraf was placed in a difficult situation after Zinner refused to reimburse him with the retainer money in the amount of $5,000.00 kept as a float. The difficulty and mental distress were because SNC action on which Ashraf's future livelihood and retirement income and care depended had sunk very fast, he was already out of pocket for close to $9,000.00 ($8,750.00) for direct payments to Zinner. He was neither in a position to hire another lawyer by way of a lump sum retainer deposit as many lawyers who looked at the history of the case felt somewhat electrocuted and did not want to dig into such a mess or alternatively wanted many folds more than a normal case, nor was Ashraf able to engage in some kind of part time work to be able to afford the restorative litigation cost ahead of him which at the time did not seem to be involving 7 years of litigation.</P>
<P>180. The mental anguish and distress caused by the shock of the above circumstances resulting in worsening of his psychological and physical health on one hand and unknown in the litigation like a blind man without his cane in the grand canyons on the other were major cause of his worsening health.</P>
<P>181. The Defendants' breaches left Ashraf in such a financial and emotional state that he was practically forced to self-represent himself in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit. Given Ashraf's susceptibility to stress-related illness, a susceptibility which was known to the Defendants, they are liable for Ashraf's mental and physical deterioration arising out of the extensive litigation he was forced to undertake.</P>
<P>182. As the result, Ashraf has lost his rightful entitlement of providing basic life and care for himself after age 65 when survival will be unlikely to achieve as his resources are depleted and the provision of reasonable pension is lost to him due to professional negligence of Zinner unless he is vindicated in this trial and in the SNC trial within the trial of this action.</P>
<P>183. In summary Zinner is liable for all pain and suffering and all direct and indirect damages Zinner's professional negligence and breach of contract has brought upon Ashraf.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>C &gt;</EM></N><TI><EM>The Defendants' breaches caused the Plaintiff to settle the SNC Action prematurely</EM></TI>
<P>184. The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that &ldquo;but for&rdquo; Zinner's substandard conduct (whether characterized as negligent or in breach of contract), Ashraf would have continued pursuing the SNC Action, rather than settling prematurely.

<P>185. Incorrect legal advice is causative of damage if it is the &ldquo;direct, immediate and logical cause&rdquo; in pursuing a particular course of conduct. Causation is not severed by receiving a second legal opinion, even if that opinion is incorrect.

<P>186. The <BOLD>stigma</BOLD> of the initial problems which tainted the Action to its end, particularly those with respect to the framing of the claims for damages with respect to loss of earning capacity arising from his manner of dismissal (as opposed to those arising from his employment, which are not and never were in issue) created a situation in which Ashraf was only allowed by the Appeal Court to advance only small part of his claim to trial.</P>
<P>187. Moreover, the incorrect advice of Zinner about the limitation time prevented Ashraf from proceeding to trial in the SNC action. He was faced with much higher risk of losing his case at the trial due to limitation issue which has a very high threshold than was actually appropriate and he lost opportunity of recovering whatever damages were allowed and escalating his claims for other damages to the Appeal Court and Supreme Court of Canada in the context of correct law of constructive dismissal if not successful at the trial.</P>
<P>188. Consequently, Ashraf also suffered a series of anxiety attacks in November 2017, just prior to scheduled trial in the SNC Action and this was another reason Ashraf was forced to settle the SNC Action. The action was resolved for significantly less than it was worth in order to salvage what he could of his claim. Ashraf's family physician, Dr. Roger Thomas, confirmed that Ashraf's anxiety attacks in November 2017 forced him to settle the SNC Action prematurely.

<P>189. It is enough to fix liability if one could foresee the loss or injury in a general way. The extent of the damage and its manner of incidence need not be foreseeable if the type of loss or injury was foreseeable.

<P>190. As argued <EM>supra</EM> at paragraph 164, the Defendants are liable for the harm inflicted upon Ashraf's physical and mental wellbeing. It is submitted that the Defendants are also, therefore, liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of Ashraf's mental and physical injuries, including Ashraf's loss of capacity to fully litigate the SNC Action.</P>
<P>191. Ashraf circumstances would have been different Healthwise and otherwise in negotiating a settlement or in the trial of November 2017 and he would have not had to settle for the amount he did had it not been for Zinner's incorrect legal advice about the &ldquo;limitation problems&rdquo; with the claims, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs.</P>
<P>192. The Parties have agreed to address the proper judicially-assessed value of the SNC Action at a later stage in these proceedings. However, Ashraf's position is that the judicially-assessed value of the SNC Action will significantly exceed the value of the settlement obtained.</P></BLOCK4>

In professional negligence cases such as this, measure of both liability and damages are assessed as being the amount the plaintiff would have recovered in the SNC action 1201-09737 &ldquo;but for&rdquo; the negligence of the lawyer, the Defendant in this case. Thus a &ldquo;trial within a trial&rdquo; must be held, in order to establish liability and damages in that action, as well.

<P>194. Damages for Zinner's breach of his tortious and contractual duties is measured by the amount that the Plaintiff would have been awarded, had the action not been derailed in the first place to lose major parts of its claim and had Ashraf not been forced to settle prematurely in light of Zinner's flawed legal advice. The value of what the Plaintiff lost is assessed by performing a &ldquo;trial within a trial.&rdquo;

Accordingly, it is submitted that the difference between the amount Ashraf actually recovered from SNC Lavalin and the amount he could have recovered, absent Zinner's negligence and breaches of contract, is an injury sustained as a direct result of Zinner's negligence and breach of contract for which Zinner is liable.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>

<P>207. The purpose of the Retainer Agreement was to advise &ldquo;whether [Ashraf had] a valid and meritorious cause of action against SNC Lavalin.&rdquo; When Zinner formed his doubts about Ashraf case, he should have disclosed them to Ashraf. By keeping these doubts about matters relevant to the retainer to himself while continuing on as solicitor of record, Zinner breached his duty of candor and thereby breached duty he owed as a fiduciary to Ashraf.</P>
<P>208. It is submitted that once the solicitor learns that he has made a significant error in the work performed for a client, he should, out of this duty take all reasonable steps to ameliorate that error whether retained at the time or not. Zinner did nothing to ameliorate the effects of his negligence, but, instead, demonstrated a malevolent attitude of disinterest, engaged in other damaging activities and incorrect legal advice and pressured Ashraf after he was terminated for payments of statement of account for wasteful services rendered which not only were of no value but severely damaged the claim and the Action.</P>
<P>209. It was obvious that Zinner was under external influence of 3<SUP>rd</SUP> parties in breach of his fiduciary duty and contract right from the time he was drafting his opinion letter. He had advised Ashraf in one way when meeting with him but when he summarized his advice in writing in his July 12, 2012 letter, it was completely a different thing. When Ashraf met with him and reminded him of what he had told him a few days earlier, Zinner redrafted the letter and date it to July 16, 2012. Although the legal advice was closer to what he had told Ashraf earlier, it still had issues contrary to the facts and evidence shown him. At no time Ashraf imposed his view on any of the issues other than acting as feedback to align Zinner's written opinion to the earlier spoken advise and understandings. Zinner never said he had changed his mind. It was obvious he was writing his opinions to please other parties who were not present in his meetings with Ashraf to know what he had told him. But then when he noticed Ashraf was going to go ahead and start the action based on his person to person assurance that the claim will advance unimpeded, he betrayed the trust of his client and planted two bars in the claim by consciously and intentionally not pleading breach of contract according to his admission in the questioning of July 23, 2015, page 113, lines 16-17, which he confirmed in his cross examination at the trial: <EM>&ldquo;As I said, it wasn't intended to expressly mention contract or to aver that there was a contractual breach.&rdquo;</EM></P>
<P>210. Obviously, it is clear when breach of contract and constructive dismissal is not pled the injuries are interpreted to have arisen from employment and not from the manner of dismissal and thereby the court had no choice but to treat it as such with the WCA bar.</P>
<P>211. At one point, Zinner stated during the same questioning session that he was aware of the WCA bar to the tort action he commenced on behalf of Ashraf. If this was the case, commencing an action he knew was barred was a direct breach of trust. If it was not the case, then it was negligent of him not to have researched or not to have known this basic principle of Alberta law, as discussed in detail in the previous section.</P>
<P>212. The conflict of interest continued after filing the claim on July 31, 2012, through August to October and upon conducting the so called his research Zinner provided legal advice by way of a letter to the Defendant in SNC action that Ashraf should discontinue the action if his claim is dismissed by the master.</P>
<P>213. Zinner then compounded his breaches of duty in failing to take steps to ameliorate the errors he made in framing and drafting the claim (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;wasted work&rdquo;) by not only billing Ashraf for the wasted work, but also by later reneging upon his termination on an agreement about reduction of charges in his invoices with respect to duplication of work or work not done which reneging resulted in not releasing the retainer amount to Ashraf which was kept as a float ($5,000.00), and taking him to multiple court hearings over more than a year.</P>
<P>214. It is submitted that in taking these series of steps, Zinner put his own interests ahead of Ashraf's, which amounts to a breach of his fiduciary duty.

<P>215. It is respectfully submitted that the misconduct described above and listed below in bullet form, constitutes breach of the fiduciary duty owed by Zinner to Ashraf. In particular, Defendants breached their duties of zealous advocacy and candor by, in essence, giving up on Ashraf while remaining solicitor of record, and by failing to advise him of his procedural options concerning an imminent summary judgment application in a timely manner or at all. Further, Zinner admitted at Questioning (July 23, 2015, p 116, ll 20&ndash;23) that, at that point in time, he ceased &ldquo;taking proactive steps on behalf of Mr. Ashraf&rdquo; because he &ldquo;wasn't convinced that Mr. Ashraf had a totally winning case.&rdquo;
<P1>a. Issuing a statement of claim for personal injuries when he knew, or should have known, that it was barred by operation of the <EM>WCA Act</EM>;</P1>
<P1>b. Alternatively, failing to advise Ashraf that his standalone tort claim for injuries would have been barred by operation of the <EM>WCA</EM>;</P1>
<P1>c. Not pleading constructive dismissal which was not out of limitation time but pleadings standalone tort of injuries which was potentially out of time;</P1>
<P1>d. Failing to include a claim for defamation, breach of contract and constructive dismissal and the tortious conduct arising from the manner of dismissal in the Statement of Claim;</P1>
<P1>e. After months of so-called research, Zinner advised Ashraf through a letter addressed to the opposing counsel that Ashraf would <UNDER>discontinue</UNDER> his claim if it was barred by the <EM>WCA</EM>,</P1>
<P1>f. Keeping Ashraf in suspense for two months after Ashraf wanted to terminate him in August 15, 2012 meeting, under the false pretense that he would accept a semi-contingency payment scheme but just needed a few days to think;</P1>
<P1>g. Failing to provide legal advice or meaningful services to Ashraf while deciding for two months whether or not he wanted to continue to act for him which is tantamount to ceasing to act and/or abandoning a client;</P1>
<P1>h. Failing to advise Ashraf to amend his Statement of Claim while the pleadings were still open, which would have forestalled the Defendant's application for dismissal of the claim;</P1>
<P1>i. Failing to advice Ashraf to start a new action for constructive dismissal and seek damages arising from manner of dismissal;</P1>
<P1>j. Charging Ashraf for work not performed, or not performed competently; and taking him to a taxation when Ashraf questioned the account;</P1>
<P1>k. Accepting with an apology for his inefficient work, an amount in full satisfaction of his invoices but later upon his termination reneged the agreement and reclaimed full amount of his invoices for work not performed, reworks or not performed competently; and taking him to a taxation;</P1>
<P1>l. Breach of trust by repeatedly breaking of promises, contradictions in his operation and lack of transparency,</P1>
<P1>m. Failure to actively keep Ashraf up to date on the litigation process,</P1></P>
<P>216. It is respectfully submitted that Zinner is liable for damages arising from the breaches of his fiduciary duties.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">PART V. CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>217. This case is not just about a lawyer's error in judgment or procedural slip. Zinner held himself out as an experienced litigator and employment lawyer, with 30 years of experience and with an hourly rate to match. Yet, he failed to advise his client that his entire claim would have been barred by virtue of the widely-known statutory immunity afforded to employers under the <EM>WCA</EM>.</P>
<P>218. Once he had been made aware of this serious mistake, Zinner ought to have, at a minimum, informed Ashraf of the procedural options available to salvage his claim. He did not. Worse yet, despite the fact that a summary judgment application was imminent, Zinner dragged his feet and ultimately gave up on Ashraf's case without informing him of his disinterest in the case and intention to virtually withdraw.</P>
<P>219. It is reasonably foreseeable that, as a litigation lawyer, leaving your client to sort out your errors on his own will inflict mental and physical stress upon him.</P>
<P>220. After his dealings with the Defendants, many lawyers either refused to take on the case because of stain and stigma attached to the action or they wanted far higher fees compared to an action properly started. On the other hand, Ashraf was financially and emotionally incapable of entrusting the SNC Action to any other lawyer on full retainer. The resulting damages were reasonably foreseeable, direct consequences of the Defendants' breaches. As such, the Defendants are liable to compensate Ashraf for all damages caused to him in the SNC action until and including its resolution in November 2017, the damages in the within actions (1401-03230 &amp; 1201-15851), the damages arising from years of suffering he endured as a result of Zinner's inadequate legal services and failure to act in a candid and loyal manner the impact of which continued all the way to the present day and will continue in future.</P></BLOCK2>

<P1>c. Costs of this Application; and</P1>
<P1>d. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems appropriate.</P1></P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTIVELY SUBMITTED, this 15 day of March 2019.</P>
