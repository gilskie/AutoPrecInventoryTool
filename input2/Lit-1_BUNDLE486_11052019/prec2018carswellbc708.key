<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">OPENING STATEMENT</TI>
<P>The main issue before the trial judge in this case was whether when Mr. Wright transferred his 1/3 interest in the royalty (the &ldquo;Royalty Interest&rdquo;) from Crew Capital Corporation to the plaintiff in 1999, he intended to gift 50% of the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff or whether he transferred the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff with the sole intention that the plaintiff act as a nominee for him.</P>
<P>The trial judge committed palpable and overriding error by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence that went to the core of the case by, most notably:
<P1>i. Ignoring the entire evidence of Paul Royce, a neutral witness who was Mr. Wright and Crew Capital Corporation's accountant at all relevant times and therefore familiar with the royalty. Mr. Royce testified that Mr. Wright told him that David Long held the royalty as a nominee. Mr. Royce was an important witness for the defence, but his evidence is not even referred to in the trial judge's decision.</P1>
<P1>ii. Ignoring the entire evidence of Gail Wright, Mr. Wright's wife. The trial judge found that a 50% interest in the royalty was gifted to the plaintiff in 1999 by Mr. Wright, in part because Mr. Wright wanted to shelter the royalty from his wife. However, Ms. Wright testified that she was always familiar with the existence of the royalty and knew from the beginning that the respondent held the royalty solely as a nominee. Ms. Wright was an important witness for the defence, yet her evidence was not addressed in the trial judge's reasons. Ms. Wright's testimony was corroborated by contemporaneous documents that proved that she was aware of the Royalty Interest at the time of the transfer to the plaintiff, also not addressed by the trial judge.</P1></P>
<P>The trial judge also committed palpable and overriding error by failing to properly assess the credibility of the plaintiff and defendants.</P></BLOCK1>

This case concerns whether Mr. Wright intended to gift the plaintiff 50% of the Royalty Interest when it was transferred to the plaintiff from Crew Capital Corporation in 1999, or whether Mr. Wright caused the Royalty Interest to be transferred to the plaintiff to hold solely as his nominee.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Background</TI>
<P>2. The plaintiff, David Long, and the defendant, Gerald Wright, were long-time friends until there was a breakdown in their relationship in late June, 2011.
<P1>Appeal Record (&ldquo;AR&rdquo;), Reasons, paras. 1 and 38</P1></P>
<P>3. In June 1992, Crew Capital Corporation acquired a royalty in a prospective potash mine in Thailand being developed by Asia Pacific Resources (APR), through the efforts of its three shareholders: Gerald Wright, John Darch, and Bob Anderson.
<P1>AR, Reasons, para. 9</P1></P>
<P>4. APR was a public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and its primary business was the development of the Udon Thani pot ash project. Gerald Wright served as its President and CEO from 1992 to 2001.</P>
<P>5. In November 1997, the three shareholders of Crew Capital Corporation and Paul Royce, the company's chartered accountant, had a meeting to discuss the future of the company. It was agreed that the royalty would be sold to the three shareholders of the company, and that they would allow Crew Capital Corporation to be struck from the registry.
<P1>Appeal Book (&ldquo;AB&rdquo;), Vol. 1, p. 24</P1></P>
<P>6. On or about February 1999, Crew Capital Corporation entered into an agreement transferring the royalty in equal parts to Alice Anderson (Bob Anderson's wife), 540438 B.C. Ltd. (John Darch's company), and the plaintiff. The agreement is dated for reference November 28, 1997.
<P1>AB, Vo1. p. 72</P1></P>
<P>7. Each of the recipients of the 1/3<SUP>rd</SUP> interest in the royalty (the &ldquo;Royalty Interest&rdquo;) agreed to pay $13,333 by way of a promissory note made in favour of Crew Capital Corporation.</P>
<P>8. On February 19, 1999, Mr. Wright caused a company controlled by him, Cypress Consulting Services Inc., to transfer the funds necessary for the plaintiff to pay out the amount of the promissory note on February 26, 1999 (shortly before it was due).
<P1>AB, Vo. 1, pp. 100&ndash;103</P1></P>
<P>9. Around March 11, 1999, George Brazier, the corporate solicitor for Crew Capital Corporation, sent Mr. Wright a draft agreement transferring the Royalty Interest from the plaintiff to an entity to be filled in later by Mr. Wright on the agreement. The agreement was referred to as the &ldquo;Blank Agreement&rdquo; at the trial.
<P1>AB, Vol. 2, p. 705</P1></P>
<P>10. On May 4, 1999, Mr. Brazier made further changes to the Blank Agreement, and provided a copy of the Blank Agreement to Gail Wright under the cover of a note to her that states as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Gail, as requested, herewith corrected Agreement for David Long.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>AB, Vol. 1, p. 110</P1></P>
<P>11. Gail Wright provided the amended Blank Agreement received from Mr. Brazier to Mr. Wright, and Mr. Wright in turn he provided it to Mr. Long for execution. Mr. Long executed the Blank Agreement, according to Mr. Wright's evidence, sometime in the first week of July, 1999. Mr. Wright and Gail Wright's evidence is that the original Blank Agreement was then held in a safe in their home in West Vancouver.
<P1>AB, Vol. 1, p. 1</P1></P>
<P>12. The Blank Agreement transferred the entire Royalty Interest from David Long to an entity to be filled in by Mr. Wright, for &ldquo;$1.00 and other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged)&rdquo;. The Blank Agreement does not make any reference to David Long retaining any beneficial interest in the Royalty Interest.</P>
<P>13. On November 10, 2009, Red Branch Investments Limited was incorporated in Hong Kong. The shareholdings of the company are held by Mr. Wright (36.5%), Gail Wright (36.5%), and their three children (27%). The directors are Mr. Wright and Gail Wright.</P>
<P>14. The plaintiff executed an agreement dated for reference September 1, 2009, transferring the Royalty Interest to Red Branch Investments Limited for &ldquo;$1.00 and other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged)&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Red Branch Agreement&rdquo;). The Red Branch Agreement is almost identical to the Blank Agreement, and similarly does not make reference to David Long retaining any beneficial interest in the Royalty Interest.
<P1>AB, Vol. 2, pp. 448&ndash;450</P1></P>
<P>15. On July 7, 2010, Mr. Wright sent an email to Andrew Gabrielson, a solicitor at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, attaching a copy of the executed Red Branch Agreement, with the plaintiff copied. In the body of the email, Mr. Wright states that the royalty holder has changed by way of the Red Branch Agreement, and describes Red Branch as a &ldquo;Wright family company, based in Hong Kong, and I am a 36.5% shareholder&rdquo;. No reference is made in the email to the plaintiff having any beneficial interest in Red Branch.
<P1>AB, Vol. 2, pp. 482 - 483</P1></P>
<P>16. At least one year after the Red Branch Agreement is entered into, the plaintiff and Mr. Wright had a falling out and their friendship came to an end, related to their respective roles as directors of Amanta Resources, a mineral exploration company that was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange at the time.
<P1>AR, Reasons, para. 24</P1></P>
<P>17. On January 26, 2012, the plaintiff's asserts an interest in and makes a demand for the transfer of <TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> of the Royalty Interest to him. Red Branch Investments Limited did not accede to the demand.
<P1>AB, Vol. 2, pp. 686 - 687</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Mr. Wright's explanation at trial for the 1999 transfer of the Royalty Interest to David Long</TI>
<P>18. Mr. Wright's evidence a trial was that he intended to hold the Royalty Interest overseas, and therefore asked the plaintiff to hold the Royalty Interest solely as his nominee until he was able to set up an overseas corporation in a tax efficient jurisdiction and transfer the Royalty Interest to it.</P>
<P>19. Mr. Wright also explained at trial that he asked Mr. Brazier to prepare the Blank Agreement, so that once he incorporated an overseas corporation he could use the Blank Agreement to transfer the royalty from the plaintiff.</P>
<P>20. The first draft of the Blank Agreement received from Mr. Brazier on March 11, 1999, contained the wrong address for the plaintiff, and because he was in Thailand he asked Mr. Brazier to correct the Blank Agreement and provide the corrected version to Gail Wright.</P>
<P>21. Mr. Wright further testified at trial that the executed Blank Agreement was kept in a safe at the family home in West Vancouver.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The plaintiff's explanation for the 1999 transfer of the Royalty Interest to him</TI>
<P>22. The plaintiff's evidence was that Mr. Wright gifted him 50% of the Royalty Interest in 1999 for the following reasons:
<P1>(a) They were life-long friends and business partners and Wright shared everything with him on a 50/50 basis;</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Wright was going to divorce his wife and did not want the Royalty Interest to become part of a divorce settlement with her; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Mr. Wright wanted to avoid having to pay any taxes in Canada that may be due if the royalty were to ever begin producing income.
<P2>Tr. Vol. 1, p. 185, ll. 1&ndash;47</P2></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge's reasons</TI>
<P>23. The trial judge concluded that the 1999 transfer of the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff was &ldquo;an initial gift by Mr. Wright of 50% interest to the plaintiff&rdquo; and described the transfer as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(a) The plaintiff was to be the initial registered owner, until the royalty interest could be transferred ultimately to a yet to be determined overseas corporation and held in trust for the benefit of both the plaintiff and Mr. Wright on an equal beneficial ownership basis;</P>
<P>(b) <UNDER>The rationale behind this ploy was initially to shelter Mr. Wright's beneficial ownership from his wife in the event of a divorce</UNDER> and secondly to later park the ownership in an overseas holding corporation with a more favourable income taxation rate;</P>
<P>(c) After their falling-out, Mr. Wright reneged on his initial agreement with the plaintiff and Red Branch must now be construed as a trustee for the plaintiff's 50% interest in the royalty.
<P1>[Emphasis added]</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P1>AR, Reasons, para. 6</P1></P>
<P>24. Therefore, the trial judge's finding that Mr. Wright transferred the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff in order to shelter it from Gail Wright, was an integral part of his decision.</P>
<P>25. In the &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section of his reasons, which forms the majority of the reasons, the trial judge essentially reviews, and appears to accept, the position and evidence called by the plaintiff at the trial. The trial judge does not in any meaningful way, consider the evidence of Mr. Wright, Paul Royce, or Gail Wright.</P>
<P>26. At paragraph 28 of his Reasons, the trial judge found that the plaintiff and Mr. Wright &ldquo;engaged in various business ventures in Ireland in the past&rdquo; and that the business relationships were arranged such that &ldquo;Mr. Wright funded them and Mr. Long operated them&rdquo;.</P>
<P>27. At trial, the plaintiff described two business ventures he had been involved in with Mr. Wright by 1999, Dublin Direct Limited and the Dublin Sports Caf&ea;. With respect to both businesses the plaintiff conceded that while the shareholdings of the companies were equally held by him and Mr. Wright, it was agreed that Mr. Wright's shareholder loans would be paid back first before any dividends were paid out the shareholders. The plaintiff agreed that he earned his shareholdings in the two companies by way of &ldquo;sweat equity&rdquo;.
<P1>Tr. Vol. 1, p. 156, ll. 7&ndash;38</P1>
<P1>Tr. Vol. 1, pp. 173 - 174</P1></P>
<P>28. There was no evidence at the trial of Mr. Wright ever having gifted the plaintiff any business interests, or of having granted the plaintiff an interest in any business that he was not involved in. The plaintiff earned his interest in the businesses that Mr. Wright invested in by way of &ldquo;sweat equity&rdquo;.</P>
<P>29. At paragraph 29 of his Reasons, the trial judge makes reference to litigation commenced in Ireland relating to the winding up of a business venture with the plaintiff. Mr. Wright funded the litigation, and shared the success of the litigation with the plaintiff 50/50.</P>
<P>30. As a result, the trial judge found that the gift of 50% of the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff, was &ldquo;entirely consistent with ventures that they had engaged in in the past&rdquo;.
<P1>AR, Reasons, para. 30</P1></P>
<P>31. The trial judge considered John Darch to be a neutral witness, having no bias in favour of either of the parties, and his evidence therefore was of particular importance to his findings. John Darch testified that Mr. Wright told him that he was appointing the plaintiff as his nominee for the royalty and that he intended to share the royalty with the plaintiff.
<P1>AR, Reasons, paras. 47&ndash;50</P1></P>
<P>32. The trial judge explained that he considered the plaintiff's version of events to be more probable, because:
<QUOTE><P>(1) The representation of a beneficial 50:50 share of the royalty is consistent with the past friendship and financial business relationship of the parties.</P>
<P>(2) Despite being warned by Mr. Darch about &ldquo;properly papering&rdquo;, the true nature of a shared 50:50 interest arrangement in the royalty transfer to Mr. Long, Mr. Wright chose not to leave a paper trail, ostensibly for personal domestic and taxation reasons. Mr. Darch in effect corroborated Mr. Long's assertion that Mr. Wright initially preferred a &ldquo;better a half than ultimately a quarter&rdquo; interest in the royalty.</P>
<P>(3) Although Mr. Wright is a sophisticated and experience businessman, he chose not to leave a traceable paper trail about the true nature of the transfer. He was concerned about potential tax consequences if the true nature of the transfer was papered. However, he could also have effected a private declaration of trust document himself and Mr. Long, known only between themselves.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>AR, Reasons, paras. 57</P1></P>
<P>33. The trial judge found that Mr. Wright decided to &ldquo;renege on their original agreement&rdquo; after the falling out between the parties.
<P1>AR, Reasons, para. 58</P1></P>
<P>34. As discussed in the argument below, the trial judge did not in his Reasons consider, or even make reference to, the testimony of Paul Royce, Gail Wright, or the Blank Agreement.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2 ERRORS IN JUDGMENT</TI>
<P>35. The trial judge erred as follows:
<P1>(a) Erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Erred in law, and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by failing to properly assess the credibility of the plaintiff and Mr. Wright.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART 3 ARGUMENT</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence</TI>
<P>36. A failure to consider relevant evidence is an error of law reviewable on the standard of correctness.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Morin</SOC><CITE>1992 CanLII 40</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 286</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>R.v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>37. An appellate court must look at the reasons of the trial judge in their entire context and consider whether the &ldquo;trial judge appears to have seized the critical issues on the trial. If the evidence is contradictory or confusing the appellate court should ask whether the trial judge appears to have dealt with contradictions&rdquo;.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. R.E.M.</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 51</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>38. This court's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Mariano v. Campbell</SOC><CITE>2010 BCCA 410</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Mariano</EM>] is instructive. While counsel in <EM>Mariano</EM> framed the appeal as an error in the trial judge's assessment of credibility, the court's conclusion that the trial judge &ldquo;did not deal with important contradictions in the evidence, and appears to have misapprehend or ignored parts of the cross-examinations of the plaintiff's witnesses&rdquo; suggest it was more appropriately an appeal for failure to consider relevant evidence and, therefore reviewed on the standard of correctness.</P>
<P>39. In <CASEREF><SOC>Van Mol v. Ashmore</SOC><CITE>1999 BCCA 6</CITE></CASEREF>, this court considered the judge's failure to refer to certain evidence in his reasons:
<QUOTE><P>[13] Sometimes a trial judge may state a piece of evidence in his or her reasons in a way which is clearly incorrect. But much more often the appellant's argument rests on the fact that the trial judge omitted to refer to a piece of evidence that was relevant to a conclusion or finding of fact. <UNDER>Such an omission is not itself an error unless the circumstances are such that the omission must give rise to a reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored, or misconceived the evidence in a way which affected his or her conclusion.</UNDER> More usually, the omission is only one factor in the overall task facing the Court of Appeal in relation to questions of fact. The task is one which the Court must face, whether the particular evidence is referred to in the trial reasons or not. That task is to decide whether, on the basis of all the evidence, there was a body of evidence which was properly, judicially, and reasonably capable of supporting the conclusion which the trial judge reached.</P>
<P>[Emphasis added]</P></QUOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The evidence of Paul Royce</TI>
<P>40. Similar to the evidence of John Darch described by the trial judge as neutral, Paul Royce was also a neutral witness with no interest in the outcome of the trial. Paul Royce was familiar with the royalty and the sale of the royalty to Crew Capital Corporation's three shareholders in 1999, because he acted as Crew Capital Corporation's chartered account during the relevant period.</P>
<P>41. Paul Royce testified at trial that he had a conversation with Mr. Wright around the time the royalty was being sold by Crew Capital Corporation about the fact that Mr. Wright wanted to have the royalty recorded in the name of the plaintiff as his nominee:
<QUOTE><P>Q: So what did you mean by that exactly when you say &ldquo;make sure you have it papered&rdquo;?</P>
<P>A: Well, obviously the entitlement and beneficial interest which would be shareholders of Crew Capital, Gerry Wright was one.</P>
<P>Q: Yes?</P>
<P>A: John Darch and Bob Anderson. So they would be getting the, you know, beneficial interest, all other things being equal. <UNDER>So when Gerry mentioned that he wanted to have David Long as his nominee</UNDER>, I said: Well, just make sure that it is papered properly so that if the intent is that you keep the beneficial interest, then there is some paperwork to support that, not withstanding the fact that somebody else's name is on it&rdquo;.</P>
<P>Q: Now, do you know if any paperwork along those lines was ever draw up?</P>
<P>A: I have no knowledge of it being drawn up, but I stressed it to Gerry several times, and by the end he was saying, &ldquo;Yes, it's taken care of.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Q: Did he say anything else with respect to the paperwork?</P>
<P>A: Yes, he said that he has paperwork in his safe. So I said fine, and left it at that.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Tr. Vol. 5, p. 877, l. 42&mdash;p. 878., l. 19</P1>
<P1>See also, Tr. Vol. 5, pp. 869 - 870</P1></P>
<P>42. The &ldquo;paperwork&rdquo; that Mr. Wright told Mr. Royce was in his safe, must have been a reference to the Blank Agreement.</P>
<P>43. In re-examination, Mr. Royce again confirmed that his understanding was that Mr. Long was acting as a nominee:
<QUOTE><P>Q: Mr. Royce, subsequent to that first meeting you had with Mr. Wright in which he described the capacity in which Mr. Long was holding the royalty, whatever that was&mdash;I guess I will ask two questions: Subsequent to that meeting or at that meeting, did you have any understanding as to in what capacity Mr. Long was holding the royalty?</P>
<P>A: Yes, it was going to be as a nominee.</P>
<P>Q: Okay. Now subsequent to that understanding, did you ever receive any information from Mr. Wright which was inconsistent with that?</P>
<P>A: No, I didn't receive any other information.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Tr. Vol. 5, p. 900, ll. 34&ndash;46</P1></P>
<P>44. Mr. Royce's evidence was critical to the appellants' defence at the trial, and yet the trial judge did not even refer to it in his reasons, let alone attempt to reconcile it with his finding that Mr. Wright intended to gift the plaintiff 50% of the Royalty Interest.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The evidence of Gail Wright</TI>
<P>45. As noted above, an important element of the trial's judge's decision that Mr. Wright intended to gift the plaintiff 50% of the Royalty Interest, was his acceptance of the plaintiff's position that Mr. Wright did so in part because he wanted to shelter it from his wife.</P>
<P>46. However, Gail Wright testified at the trial that she was aware of the royalty &ldquo;from day one&rdquo;, and that she had discussed with her husband the fact that Mr. Long held the Royalty Interest as a nominee.
<P1>Tr. Vol. 5, p. 793, l. 46&mdash;p. 798, l. 5</P1></P>
<P>47. Ms. Wright explained that she received the note from Mr. Brazier in May 1999, by going to his office to pick it up and that the Blank Agreement was attached to the note. It was &ldquo;quite normal procedure&rdquo; for her to pick up documents from Mr. Brazier's office for Mr. Wright if he was not home.</P>
<P>48. Ms. Wright was also forwarded a number of emails by Mr. Wright from Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP after the firm was retained in 2006 and paid some of the firm's accounts. Those emails made it clear that the Royalty Interest was registered in the plaintiff's name.
<P1>Tr. Vol. 5, p. 806, l. 6&mdash;p. 811, l. 19</P1></P>
<P>49. All of Ms. Wright's evidence was extremely relevant and went to the critical issue of whether Mr. Wright was attempting to shelter the Royalty Interest from her, but the trial judge did not even make reference to her evidence in his reasons.</P>
<P>50. Moreover, there is no indication as to whether he accepted or rejected her evidence that she had been told by Mr. Wright that the plaintiff held the royalty solely as a nominee. Even if the trial judge rejected that evidence, at a minimum it was still incumbent on him to explain how he came to the conclusion that Mr. Wright initially intended to shelter the Royalty Interest from Ms. Wright, in light of the fact that she received a copy of the Blank Agreement directly from Mr. Brazier.</P>
<P>51. If Mr. Wright's intent was to hide the Royalty Interest from Ms. Wright, it is utterly implausible that he would have only a few months after transferring the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff allowed Mr. Brazier to provide Ms. Wright with the Blank Document evidencing that the Royalty Interest was held by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>52. This is a contradiction that the trial judge was obliged to explain.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Paragon Capital Corp. v. Morgan</SOC><CITE>2014 ABCA 363</CITE><PARANUM>48</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Sheppard</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 26</CITE><PARANUM>15, 28</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>53. It is respectfully submitted that the critical nature of Mr. Royce and Ms. Wright's evidence, must give rise to a reasonable belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored, or misconceived their evidence in a way that affected his conclusion.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>The trial judge erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by failing to properly assess the credibility of the plaintiff and Mr. Wright</TI>
<P>54. The plaintiff's position at trial was that the February 1999 transfer of the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff was 50% a gift. Accordingly, the presumption of resulting trust applies to this case, and the burden of proof was on the plaintiff, on a balance of probabilities, to displace the presumption that Mr. Wright did not intend to gift the plaintiff a portion of the Royalty Interest.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fuller v. Harper</SOC><CITE>2010 BCCA 421</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Pecore v. Pecore</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 17</CITE></CASEREF> [<EM>Pecore</EM>]</P1></P>
<P>55. In considering the intention of the transferor, it was necessary that the trial judge consider whether the &ldquo;transferor had any rational purpose for the transfer other than a gift&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Pecore</EM> at paras. 45&ndash;47</P1></P>
<P>56. It appears that the trial judge considered the evidence of the plaintiff to be more probable for three main reasons:
<P1>(a) The gift of 50% of the Royalty Interest was consistent with the past friendship and financial business relationship of the parties;</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Darch corroborated the plaintiff's assertion that Mr. Wright initially preferred a &ldquo;better a half than ultimately a quarter interest in the royalty&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(c)Mr. Wright is a sophisticated businessman, and could have effected a private declaration of trust document between himself and Mr. Long.</P1></P>
<P>57. With respect, all three reasons are contradicted by the evidence at trial. First, the consistent evidence at the trial was that to the extent Mr. Wright and the plaintiff had a business relationship, it was on the basis that Mr. Wright invested in the business and the plaintiff would <UNDER>earn</UNDER> his 50% by way of sweat equity. There was no evidence at the trial of Mr. Wright gifting the plaintiff shares of any companies the plaintiff was not involved in.</P>
<P>58. The trial judge's finding at paragraph 30 of his reasons that the gift of 50% of the Royalty Interest was &ldquo;entirely consistent with ventures [Mr. Wright and the plaintiff] engaged in in the past&rdquo; has no support in the evidence, and is contrary to his own finding at paragraph 28 that the business relationship between them was such that Mr. Wright funded the business and Mr. Long operated them.</P>
<P>59. The royalty was earned through the efforts of the three shareholders of Crew Capital Corporation and the plaintiff had nothing to do with it.</P>
<P>60. Second, the assertion that Mr. Wright was gaining a &ldquo;half&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;quarter interest in the royalty&rdquo; by sheltering it from his wife, does not make sense and is also not supported by the evidence. If Mr. Wright really was seeking to shelter the Royalty Interest from his wife, he was not gaining anything by then gifting 50% of the Royalty Interest to the plaintiff. In effect, the plaintiff simply stepped into Ms. Wright's shoes.</P>
<P>61. In addition, the plaintiff testified that if the Royalty Interest began to generate revenue while he held it, he would have reported 100% of the revenue to his country's tax authorities and presumably then would have paid taxes in Ireland on the proceeds. Mr. Wright would not have therefore reaped any tax savings by gifting the plaintiff a 50% interest.
<P1>Tr. Vol. 1, p. 183, ll. 8&ndash;38</P1></P>
<P>62. Third, while it is correct that Mr. Wright did not effect a private declaration of trust document, he did &ldquo;properly paper&rdquo; and protect his interests by causing the plaintiff to enter into the Blank Agreement. The Blank Agreement gave Mr. Wright the ability to transfer the royalty to another entity at any time.</P>
<P>63. Moreover, the trial judge did not explain why the fact that Mr. Wright did not &ldquo;leave a traceable paper trail about the true nature of the transfer&rdquo; made the plaintiff's version of events more probable. The trial judge accepted that it was reasonable for the plaintiff to trust Mr. Wright at his word based on their long personal and professional relationship at paragraph 36 of his reasons, and there was no reason for the trial judge not to accept that Mr. Wright equally trusted the plaintiff.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>In the words of the learned trial judge, the primary issue faced in this action was the &ldquo;conflicting credibility between the parties as to their agreed arrangement.&rdquo;</P>
<P>While, the appellants, Gerald Wright and Red Branch Investments Ltd., allege that the trial judge committed palpable and overriding errors by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence, there is simply no basis for this allegation.</P>
<P>The trial of this action involved the testimony of 8 witnesses, 5 for the plaintiff and 3 for the defendants, and required 14 days to be heard, with an additional day for special costs. The witnesses were all subject to extensive cross examination and counsel gave substantive closing submissions in both oral and written form. The trial judge reserved for almost two months and, while his reasons are brief, they dealt with the single most important issue at trial, being the credibility of the two main witnesses, David Long and Gerald Wright.</P>
<P>In the end, after considering all of the evidence, the trial judge found that Mr. Long's version of events was more believable than that of Mr. Wright and, accordingly, he found in favour of the plaintiff. In finding for the plaintiff, the trial judge gave his reasons for preferring the evidence of Mr. Long over that of Mr. Wright. While he did not expressly say so, by implication, the trial judge rejected the evidence of Mr. Wright's wife, Gail Wright, and did not consider the evidence of Paul Royce to be determinative of the findings, especially in light of the trial judge's finding in the special costs hearing that Mr. Wright was capable of putting forward a &ldquo;self-serving story&rdquo;.</P>
<P>In short, there were no errors in judgment on the part of the trial judge, let alone palpable and overriding errors. Instead, in this appeal, the appellants are seeking to have this Honourable Court substitute its discretion in the place of the trial judge without any basis to do so.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III">PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>1. Long and Wright were long-time friends and business partners, having met in Belfast in 1974.
<P1>Appellants' Appeal Record (&ldquo;<BOLD>AAR</BOLD>&rdquo;), Reasons for Judgment, paras. 1 and 13</P1></P>
<P>2. Wright, Darch and Bob Anderson were each one third shareholders in Crew, as well as directors and officers of the company.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 9</P1></P>
<P>3. Crew owned the Royalty which was a 1.5% (of 75%) royalty interest in a potash mine which had yet to be developed in Thailand by Asia Pacific.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 8</P1></P>
<P>4. In August 1996, Wright and Long incorporated two companies in Ireland of which they are both directors, being Dublin Direct Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Dublin Direct</BOLD>&rdquo;) and Norvan Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Norvan</BOLD>&rdquo;). Wright and Long were equal shareholders in Norvan. In turn, Norvan owned all of the shares of Dublin Direct and, subsequently, Dublin Sports Caf&ea; Ltd. (&ldquo;<BOLD>Dublin Sports Caf&ea;</BOLD>&rdquo;), which owned and operated the Pub. Wright always provided the funding for these various business ventures, some of which was significant.
<P1>Transcript Extract Book of the Respondent (&ldquo;<BOLD>TEB</BOLD>&rdquo;) Tab 1, pp. 16 to 19, ll. 3&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1-2</P1>
<P1>TEB Tab 2, pp. 21 to 23, ll. 40&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;32</P1></P>
<P>5. In January 1998, a location was secured for the Pub, and a lease was signed in April that year. Construction on the Pub started shortly thereafter and it began operations on October 22, 1998. Wright had no operational involvement in the Pub. While Dublin Sports Caf&ea; paid his living expenses in Dublin, at no time was Long able to draw a salary from the Pub. Long struggled to keep the Pub operational until it was forced into liquidation on October 17, 2003.
<P1>TEB Tab 3, pp. 31 to 35, ll. 44&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;13</P1></P>
<P>6. On November 4, 1997, the directors of Crew determined that they did not want to leave the Royalty in the company anymore, and decided that each of them would purchase a one-third share of it for $13,333. Despite the fact that the sale had not taken place, Crew reported the sale of the Royalty to the Shareholders to CRA during its February 28, 1998 fiscal period.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 10</P1></P>
<P>7. In [date omitted], Bob Anderson died unexpectedly.</P>
<P>8. On or about February 16, 1999, Crew received the Opinion which explained how best to deal with the various tax issues that could arise due to the reported sale of the Royalty to CRA. There were two options provided in the Opinion, being to consider the sale of the Royalty to the Shareholders null and void as it had not been paid for, or to leave the sale of the Royalty as it was and buttress the facts surrounding the sale in the Royalty Agreement. The second option was the one that Crew opted to follow.
<P1>TEB Tab 37, pp. 889 to 890, ll. 14&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;22</P1>
<P1>Appellants' Appeal Book (&ldquo;<BOLD>AAB</BOLD>&rdquo;) pp. 96&ndash;99, Exhibit 1, Tab 20</P1></P>
<P>9. It was agreed by the external accountant for Crew at the time, Paul Royce (&ldquo;<BOLD>Royce</BOLD>&rdquo;), and Darch that the Opinion was the catalyst for the Royalty Agreement and the promissory notes referred to therein, as well as the date selected for the purchase of the Royalty. Royce's evidence was that Wright was in the meeting with Mr. Voyer for the purpose of preparing the Opinion. On cross examination, contrary to the evidence of Darch and Royce, Wright denied that the Opinion had anything to do with the steps that were followed or that he had any involvement with it.
<P1>TEB Tab 35, pp. 872 to 873, ll. 20&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;4</P1>
<P1>TEB Tab 19, pp. 618 to 622, ll. 9&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;41</P1>
<P1>TEB Tab 20, pp. 625 to 626, ll. 11&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;21</P1></P>
<P>10. According to Long, he was contacted by Wright in February 1999, about the Royalty. During this conversation Wright told Long that he was sending him over some papers, being the Royalty Agreement and Promissory Note, that he needed Long to sign and return them as soon as possible, and that he would send the funds required to complete the sale under the Royalty Agreement. Long agreed, signing and returning the Royalty Agreement and Promissory Note.
<P1>TEB Tab 4, pp. 43 to 45, ll. 40&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;22</P1></P>
<P>11. By way of a personal cheque dated February 19, 1999, Wright caused $15,000 to be taken from his own personal CIBC account, and not the joint HSBC account that he shared with Mrs. Wright, to be deposited into the account of his own personal corporation Cypress. Despite the evidence of Mrs. Wright that she would take care of all accounts on behalf of the Wrights and their businesses, the payment was effected by Wright leaving a pre-signed cheque for Peter Wong, the company accountant, and not Mrs. Wright. Mr. Wong then, in turn, caused Cypress to wire $15,073.30 to Long on this same day. Long subsequently wired $14,310 (the amount wired to him less exchange rates and handling fees) to Crew for payment of the Royalty.
<P1>TEB Tab 7, pp. 543 to 546, ll. 46-47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;11</P1></P>
<P>12. Both Wright and Royce confirmed that Crew received the funds from Long for the payment of the Royalty.
<P1>TEB Tab 6, pp. 543 to 545, ll. 43&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;31</P1>
<P1>TEB Tab 38, pp. 894 to 895, ll. 45&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;29</P1></P>
<P>13. Of note, it was the evidence of Mrs. Wright that, in 1999, all family money was held in a joint account with HSBC and that their &ldquo;personal accounts&rdquo;, as a general rule, had nothing in them. Wright would leave signed blank cheques for Mrs. Wright with Cypress in case there was something that Wright wanted put through in his absence as she was paying bills and keeping everything organized.
<P1>TEB Tab 27, pp. 791 to 792, ll. 27&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;24</P1></P>
<P>14. Mrs. Wright was not involved in any way in the transferring of funds to Long on February 19, 1999. In fact, on cross examination, Mrs. Wright's evidence was that Wright &ldquo;probably&rdquo; still had an account with CIBC in 1999 but that it was &ldquo;never used.&rdquo; When confronted with the CIBC cheque, she changed her evidence to say that it did not matter since she was responsible for all the accounts, but then admitted that it was not her writing on the cheque which was used to transfer the funds to Cypress nor did she attend at the bank to wire the funds to Long. In addition, after claiming that she did all the bookkeeping for their family and their companies, Mrs. Wright further admitted that the bookkeeping entry for this payment was not done in her writing. Most telling, however, was her flat out denial that the funds which were sent on that date were sent to Long to pay for the Royalty and that the Royalty was paid directly by Cypress to Crew. In her words this &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; did not happen and Long definitely did not send the funds to Crew for the purchase of the Royalty.
<P1>TEB Tab 30, pp. 840 to 842, ll. 9&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;42</P1></P>
<P>15. Wright confirmed that Mrs. Wright would have had the ability to undertake this transaction to Long but, instead, he asked Mr. Wong to deal with it.
<P1>TEB Tab 26, pp. 740 to 741, ll. 27&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;40</P1></P>
<P>16. Around the same time as the Royalty was being purchased, Wright also caused a condominium to be purchased in Bangkok in the name of Ms. Sanksuwan. He told Mrs. Wright that Ms. Sanksuwan was a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;business associate&rdquo;, and that it was being put into her name to help with the mortgage. He did not tell Mrs. Wright of the nature of his relationship with Ms. Sanksuwan, that she was living in the condominium full time or that she stayed in it with him when he was in Thailand.
<P1>TEB Tab 29, pp. 838 to 839, ll. 15&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;46</P1></P>
<P>17. The purchase of the Royalty was finally effected by way of the Royalty Agreement in late February 1999, but backdated to November 1997 in order to prevent estate issues arising from Mr. Anderson's death. Wright placed his share of the Royalty into Long's name.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, paras. 11 through 13</P1></P>
<P>18. Despite the fact that the Royalty Agreement was not entered into until late February 1999, it was the evidence of Mrs. Wright that she would have placed this signed agreement into their safe in their home in West Vancouver in November 1997, more than a year and a half before it was signed.
<P1>TEB Tab 28, p. 795, ll. 11&ndash;16</P1></P>
<P>19. According to Long, whose evidence was accepted by the trial judge as fact, Wright placed the Royalty in Long's name, having gifted Long a 50% beneficial interest in this asset and holding the other half for the benefit of Wright. According to Long, Wright told him that he would rather gift half of the Royalty to Long than pay half to CRA and then share the remaining half with Mrs. Wright, whom he was planning to leave at the time.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 15</P1></P>
<P>20. Darch, an independent witness with no vested interest in this litigation, confirmed that Wright had also told him around this time that he intended to leave Mrs. Wright for Ms. Sanksuwan, and that he had gifted half of the beneficial interest in the Royalty to Long as he would &ldquo;rather receive a half than a quarter&rdquo; after he paid taxes to CRA, and settled out in a divorce with Mrs. Wright. Darch warned Wright on several occasions to properly document this transaction.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, paras. 47, 48 and 50</P1></P>
<P>21. According to Wright, whose evidence was rejected by the trial judge, he placed the Royalty into Long's name as a mere nominee and was held in trust by Long for the 100% beneficial interest of Wright.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 16</P1></P>
<P>22. According to Long, in April or May 1999, Wright came to visit him in Belfast with Ms. Sanksuwan, advising Long that he had married Ms. Sanksuwan in a Thai wedding ceremony. Wright advised Long that he was planning to leave Mrs. Wright and move to Thailand with Ms. Sanksuwan. During this visit, Wright asked Long to sign the Blank Transfer Agreement in case he needed to move the Royalty quickly.
<P1>TEB Tab 5, pp. 50&ndash;53, ll. 22&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;35</P1></P>
<P>23. It was the evidence of Royce that Wright told him that he intended to move to Thailand in the future.
<P1>TEB Tab 34, p. 870, ll. 25&ndash;33</P1></P>
<P>24. While it was the evidence of Mrs. Wright that she picked up a &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; version of the Blank Transfer Agreement from George Brazier (&ldquo;<BOLD>Brazier</BOLD>&rdquo;), then counsel for Crew, this evidence was not accepted by the plaintiff and was subject to vigorous cross examination. There was no independent evidence outside of the testimony of Mrs. Wright that she picked up the Blank Transfer Agreement in May 1999. In fact, the evidence of Mrs. Wright was not supported by document production provided by the Defendants as the document appended to this note in the Defendants' production was a corrected version of the Royalty Agreement which named Long as the owner of the Royalty. Of note, Brazier was not called as a witness at trial.
<P1>TEB Tab 31, pp. 843 to 847, ll. 8&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;22</P1></P>
<P>25. It was the evidence of Wright that the Blank Transfer Agreement was signed by Long in July 1999 and that Long continued to hold the Royalty on behalf of himself for 11 years, until June 2010, at which time Wright asked him to transfer the entirety of it to Red Branch, a company owned and controlled by Wright and his family in Hong Kong.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 17</P1></P>
<P>26. In 2006, Asia Pacific was sold to a Thai national company, Italia Thai. Darch wanted to ensure that Italia Thai would honour the Royalty Agreement and, as a result, he contacted Wright to discuss hiring legal counsel to deal with the matter. Wright agreed and on April 26, 2006, he had Long sign a letter authorizing Wright to act as his agent in relation to the Royalty (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Agency Letter</BOLD>&rdquo;).
<P1>AAB p. 149, Exhibit 1, Tab 38</P1></P>
<P>27. Legal counsel were initially retained by Darch and Wright to insure that Italia Thai honoured the Royalty Agreement. Alice Anderson was later included in this arrangement. At all times, Long was named as the client and Wright was said to be Long's authorized agent. At no time did Wright advise the other Royalty holders or legal counsel that he was the beneficial owner of the Royalty or that Long was a mere nominee. Instead, Wright made the following representations:
<P1>a. On April 25, 2006, he drafted the Agency Letter in which Long was noted as the registered holder of the Royalty and in which he appointed Wright as his:
<QUOTE><P>Agent, with full authority to act on my behalf, in all matters relating to this Royalty. (AAB p. 149, Exhibit 1, Tab 38).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>b. He wrote to David Anderson on April 25, 2006, stating:
<QUOTE><P>The Royalty interest was subsequently sold by Crew Capital Corp. to Bob, John and myself (0.5% each), personally, and since then these interests [sic] have been assigned, equally, to one of John's private holding companies, an overseas business acquaintance of mine (Mr. David Long) and to Bob's estate... I confirm that I act as Agent for Mr. Long and have the authority to appoint you as his representative in this matter. (AAB pp. 152-153, Exhibit 1, Tab 40).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>Of note, both Darch's company and Bob Anderson's estate had legal and beneficial ownership of their shares of the Royalty.</P1>
<P1>c. In his May 2, 2006 email to Mark Andrews, QC, Wright stated:
<QUOTE><P>Crew Capital Corp subsequently sold the Royalty interest to Bob, John and myself (0.5% each), personally and, since then, these interests have been assigned, equally to one of John's private holding companies, to Bob Anderson's estate and to an overseas business acquaintance of mine, Mr. David Long (I confirm that I am authorized to act as Agent for Mr. Long in this matter).</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>The Royalty holders feel that their interests are threatened by the takeover and the intent of the purchasers to convert Asia Pacific to a private, non-reporting company. (AAB pp. 163-164, Exhibit 1, Tab 46).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>d. Also on May 2, 2006, Wright stated as follows to Darch:
<QUOTE><P>Incidentally, David Long has given me written authority to act on his behalf, and he will be responsible for his part of the costs. I'll keep him fully informed and, if Mark needs anything from him, I'll arrange it. (AAB v. 1, pp. 168&ndash;170, Exhibit 1, Tab 50).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>e. On May 8, 2006, Wright forwarded the Agency Letter to Mr. Andrews, QC, (AAB v. 1, p. 149, Exhibit 1, Tab 38) by email (AAB v. 2, p. 759, Exhibit 9). In this email he wrote:
<QUOTE><P>PS. For your info. I attach a letter from Mr. David Long, one of the Royalty holders, appointing me as his Agent. David, aho [sic] is a close business associate of mine, acquired the Royalty from Crew Capital Corp in 1999.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>f. The June 28, 2006 retainer letter from Fasken Martineau notes Long as their client and provides that Wright is acting as Long's agent. It also confirms Wright's guarantee to pay Long's portion of the legal fees. Wright was responsible for keeping Long informed. Again, there is no mention of Wright having any beneficial interest in the Royalty (AAB, v. 1, pp. 216&ndash;220, Exhibit 1, Tab 65). This retainer letter was forwarded to Wright to forward to Long (AAB, v. 1, pp. 221&ndash;225, Exhibit 1, Tab 66), which Wright did (AAB, v. 1, pp. 63&ndash;69, Exhibit 1, Tabs 68 and 69).</P1>
<P1>g. On July 14, 2006, Mr. Wright wrote:
<QUOTE><P>I gather that David Long has already signed and sent you the Representation Letter. When we meet, I'll also sign it and deliver the requested retainer on Mr. Long's behalf. ...</P>
<P>We should not expose the Royalty holders to a taxation regime which they are not familiar with or, presently, subject to. Each of the Royalty Holders will have their own taxation treatment depending upon their tax domicile. (AAB, v. 1, pp. 235-236, Exhibit 1, Tab 70).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>h. On August 18, 2006, Wright wrote:
<QUOTE><P>Regarding the tax issue, I don't think John's willingness to accept royalty payments in Canada net of the withholding tax deals with the issue. [...] Also, David Long (or his personal company) is not a Canadian taxpayer and does not feel that agreeing to a 15%, probably non-recoverable, withholding tax is the best way to deal with the situation. (AAB, v. 1, pp. 72&ndash;78, Exhibit 1, Tabs 78 and 79)</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>i. On August 21, 2006, Wright responded to tax advice obtained by Darch as follows:
<QUOTE><P>thanks for the tax info. from M. Butters. I note the existence of a tax treaty between Thailand and the UK. Unfortunately D. Long is a resident of the Republic of Ireland at the moment, but I'm sure he can consider reorganizing the domicile for the royalty interest if there is a benefit in doing so. (AAB, v. 1, pp. 278&ndash;280, Exhibit 1, Tab 84).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>j. On August 23, 2006, Wright received an email from Long asking about &ldquo;the new royalty agreement&rdquo; that was being referred to in emails that he was receiving from Mr. Darch. (AAB, v. 1, pp. 294-295, Exhibit 1, Tab 88). Wright responded:
<QUOTE><P>The &lsquo;new&rsquo; Royalty agreement refers to the change in ownership and the recognition of the present agreement. The Thai company wants to wrap up APR and hold the assets in Thailand, so we are replacing the APR agreement with one from the Thai company, on the same general terms. Naturally, each side is &lsquo;covering its ass&rsquo; as much as is reasonable. One negative, from my viewpoint, is that revenues will be reduced by a 15% withholding tax on funds remitted from Thailand, but it's better to tighten up the agreement at this point rather than have to get the lawyers involved later.</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>k. On November 9, 2006, Wright wrote:
<QUOTE><P>Incidentally, David Long does intend to assign his portion of the royalty to a private (European) holding company. It may be more convenient, given that the agreement is not yet finalized, that this company should be a party to the agreement rather than David? (AAB, v. 1, pp. 304&ndash;308, Exhibit 1, Tab 93).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>l. On December 13, 2006, Mr. Gabrielson asked Wright to which address he should forward the signed Royalty agreement (AAB, v. 1, p. 393, Exhibit 1, Tab 104). Wright responded by giving Mr. Gabrielson Long's address as opposed to his own, despite his evidence that he kept all important information relating to the Royalty in his safe in his house in West Vancouver.</P1>
<P1>m. On March 23, 2007, Wright emailed Mr. Wang and provided:
<QUOTE><P>my name is Gerry Wright and I have been involved with the proposed Sin Rae royalty agreement on behalf of my associate, Mr. David Long, <UNDER>one of the three Asia Pacific Royalty holders</UNDER>. [...] I recently attended a Vancouver meeting with the lawyers for the Royalty holders, as well as one of the other Royalty holders (Mr. John Darch, a former associate of mine) and I think it may be useful to have an information meeting with you. (AAB, v. 2, p. 762, Exhibit 10, emphasis added).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>n. On March 27, 2007, Wright emailed Darch with respect to meeting with Mr. Wang and provided:
<QUOTE><P>I'm leaving Bangkok tomorrow, for Dublin, and will meet with David Long on Friday. (AAB, v. 2, p. 763, Exhibit 11).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>o. On July 2, 2007, when it looked like the matter might be going to litigation, Wright wrote:
<QUOTE><P>However, neither David Long or I relish significant legal costs, unless there is no alternative to Court action. (AAB, v. 2, pp. 396&ndash;403, Exhibit 1, Tab 107).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>p. On November 24, 2009, Wright wrote to Mr. Gabrielson, after receiving email correspondence from Darch and stated:
<QUOTE><P>Incidentally, David Long will be assigning his royalty interest to a third party, a private company registered in Hong Kong. I shall arrange for David to provide you with a copy of the assignment agreement so that the finalized documents can include the new <UNDER>beneficial</UNDER> holder rather than David. (AAB, v. 2, p. 472, Exhibit 2, Tab 121, emphasis added).</P></QUOTE></P1>
<P1>q. On November 29, 2009, Wright wrote to Mr. Gabrielson to provide:
<QUOTE><P>David Long has asked me to provide details of the assignment of his royalty interest to a Hong Kong company. [...] David will confirm the assignment and provide you with a copy of the assignment agreement, shortly. (AAB, v. 2, p. 473, Exhibit 2, Tab 122).</P></QUOTE></P1></P>
<P>28. It was the evidence of Long, which was accepted by the trial judge, that in June 2010 Long was asked to sign the Red Branch Transfer Agreement and, at the time that he signed this Agreement, Wright expressly made the following representations to him:
<P1>(a) That he was the beneficial owner of Red Branch and that he controlled the company;</P1>
<P1>(b) That the reason he wanted to transfer the Royalty was because there were tax advantages to both Long and himself to having the Royalty held by a Hong Kong company; and,</P1>
<P1>(c) That Red Branch would continue to hold the Royalty in trust for both Long and Wright as before, with each of them having an equal beneficial interest and, as a result, he would make Long a 50% shareholder and director of Red Branch.
<P2>AAR, Reasons, para. 19</P2></P1></P>
<P>29. According to Long, given their lifelong friendship and business relationship that had been shared between them, Long trusted Wright and agreed to sign the Red Branch Transfer Agreement for $1.00, which agreement was dated for reference September 1, 2009. The trial judge accepted that this type of arrangement was typical as between Long and Wright and that Long trusted Wright to follow through with his promise. While he was not immediately made an officer and director of Red Branch, Long had complete faith that Wight would honour his representations.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, paras. 20 to 22</P1></P>
<P>30. The objective evidence showed that, consistent with Long's understanding and the representations that were said to have been made, in May 2011, Wright provided Long with confidential information related to the Royalty. It was the further accepted evidence of Long that shortly after Wright sent him this email, Wright discussed the contents of it with him at length when they met later that month.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, para. 23</P1>
<P1>AAB, v. 2, pp. 586&ndash;589, Exhibit 2, Tab 144</P1></P>
<P>31. It was only after his falling out with Wright at the end of June 2011, that Long began to question whether or not Wright would honour their agreement and insure that Red Branch held half of the Royalty in trust for him. As a result, in January 2012, a demand was made of Red Branch to confirm this fact. Red Branch refused to acknowledge this trust and, as a result, the within action was commenced.
<P1>AAR, Reasons, paras. 45 and 46</P1>
<P1>AAB, v. 2, pp. 684-685, Exhibit 2, Tab 190</P1></P>
<P>32. The plaintiff tendered evidence from four independent and neutral witnesses with no financial interest in the outcome of the litigation, being Darch, David Anderson, Mr. Andrews, QC, and Mr. Gabrielson.</P>
<P>33. Darch's key evidence was as follows:
<P1>(a) He was a long time business associate of Wright and a fellow Royalty holder. He testified that Wright told him that he was appointing Long as his nominee and he was sharing his share of the Royalty with Long as he would rather receive half of the Royalty than lose half to CRA and share the other half with Mrs. Wright, whom he was planning to leave for his Thai mistress. According to Darch, Wright told him this on more than one occasion.</P1>
<P1>(b) He advised Wright that if he was going to transfer legal ownership of the Royalty to Long that he should &ldquo;properly paper the transaction&rdquo; in order to avoid a future dispute about the actual extent of Long's interest in the Royalty. Wright advised that he had &ldquo;already taken care of the matter.&rdquo;</P1>
<P1>(c) The original Royalty Agreement was entered into in February 1999, and the Agreement was back-dated due to the untimely death of Bob Anderson.
<P2>AAR, Reasons, paras. 47 to 50</P2></P1></P>
<P>34. David Anderson's key evidence was as follows:
<P1>(a) He is a lawyer and the brother of the late Bob Anderson. He represented Alice Anderson with respect to the Royalty.</P1>
<P1>(b) Alice Anderson was asked to participate in the amended Royalty Agreement with Italia Thai even though she did not contribute to the legal bills that were issued by Fasken Martineau in relation to same.</P1>
<P1>(c) Based upon communications received from Wright, Dave Anderson's understanding was that Long owned the Royalty and that Wright was acting as Long's agent.
<P2>AAR, Reasons, paras. 51 and 52</P2></P1></P>
<P>35. With respect to Mr. Andrews, QC, and Mr. Gabrielson, the trial judge considered the fact that their evidence, as lawyers, was that until the Royalty was transferred to Red Branch they believed Mr. Long to be the owner of said Royalty, and that Wright was acting as his agent. Despite the fact that Wright was instructing them, at no time did he advise them that he held a beneficial ownership in the Royalty.

<P>36. As part of their case, the Defendants called Royce, who is a personal friend of the Wrights, was the accountant for Crew and continues to be the accountant for the Wrights. Royce's evidence in direct was as follows:
<P1>(a) When Wright told him he was going to put the Royalty into Long's name, that he told Wright if he intended to keep the benefit of the Royalty then he needed to make sure that he had the paperwork in place to satisfy that he maintained that beneficial interest;</P1>
<P1>(b) When asked specifically whether or not he understood Long to have a beneficial interest in the Royalty, he told Wright that if he intended to retain the beneficial interest in the Royalty then he should make sure that he papered it in such a way that anyone looking at it would say that it might be in Long's name but that Wright had the beneficial interest in it;</P1>
<P1>(c) Wright advised him that he was intending to live offshore in Thailand and that he was tax driven to put it in someone else's name; and,</P1>
<P1>(d) When he counseled Wright to get the paperwork done, Wright told him that he would &ldquo;take care of it&rdquo; but Mr. Royce was never privy to this documentation.
<P2>TEB Tab 33, pp. 869 to 871, ll. 42&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;14</P2></P1></P>
<P>37. On cross examination, Royce confirmed that Wright told him that he was putting the Royalty in Long's name and that he told him if he intended to keep the beneficial interest then this should be put in writing. There were no further details provided other than Wright telling him that it was taken care of and in his safe.
<P1>TEB Tab 39, p. 895, ll. 30&ndash;41</P1></P>
<P>38. Royce's further evidence was that if Wright was the beneficial owner of the Royalty, he would have been obligated to report the disposition of the Royalty to Red Branch in the tax year when it was done. But Wright did not do this.
<P1>TEB Tab 40, pp. 897 to 898, ll. 13&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;20</P1></P>
<P>39. In re-examination Royce was asked a leading question by counsel for the defendants that incorrectly summarized his evidence, stating that Wright had told him that Long would be acting as his nominee. It was only after being asked this leading question that Royce stated he had been told this.
<P1>TEB Tab 41, pp. 900 to 901, ll. 9&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;3</P1></P>
<P>40. Even if Royce's evidence could be accepted that Wright had told him that Long was a nominee, as set out above, Wright told other parties, including Darch and counsel at Fasken Martineau, that Long was the owner of the Royalty and that he had a beneficial interest.</P>
<P>41. Mrs. Wright was not an independent witness and has the same vested interest as Wright in this litigation.</P>
<P>42. There were no other witnesses called by the Defendants in the trial of this action.</P>
<P>43. In choosing to accept Long's version of events, the trial judge provided the following reasons:
<P1>(a) That the representation of a beneficial 50:50 share of the Royalty was consistent with the past friendship and financial business relationships between Long and Wright;</P1>
<P1>(b) That, despite being warned about &ldquo;properly papering&rdquo; the nature of the shared Royalty arrangement with Long, Wright chose not to leave a paper trail, ostensibly for personal domestic and taxation reasons and Darch corroborated the reasons provided by Long; and,</P1>
<P1>(c) Even though Wright is a sophisticated and experienced businessman, he chose not to leave a traceable paper trail about the true nature of the transfer, being concerned about potential taxation consequences if the true nature of the transfer was papered. Despite this, he did not effect a private declaration of trust document between himself and Long.

<P>45. On February 9, 2016, after having obtained judgment, Long applied for special costs. In granting same, the trial judge specifically held as follows:
<P1>(a) That the pre-litigation conduct of the Defendants was unconscionable and in the nature of fraud.</P1>
<P1>(b) That after gifting 50 percent of the Royalty to Long and then later persuading Long to transfer his ownership to Red Branch on an express oral trust basis, Wright reneged on the agreement and denied the existence of Long's beneficial interest, which breached the fiduciary duty of the defendants and was a fraud.</P1>
<P1>(c) That during the trial Wright continued his deceit by alleging that Long commenced the within action as a means of revenge and to engage on a campaign of harassment against him, necessitating a protraction of the litigation and added unnecessary time and expense to the trial by alleging a defence without merit and an obfuscation of the major issue: was there a created trust and a breach thereof.</P1>
<P1>(d) That at trial much time was spent casting aspersions on Long's character going to his overall credibility.</P1>
<P1>(e) That he put forward a self-serving story that Long's involvement in the transaction was only as a convenient favour for Wright without beneficial interest and that this story when coupled with the character aspersions was reprehensible.

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV">PART 2&mdash;ERRORS IN JUDGMENT OR ISSUES ON APPEAL</TI>
<P>46. The appellants allege that the trial judge erred as follows:
<P1>(a) That he erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence; and,</P1>
<P1>(b) That he erred in law, and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by failing to properly assess the credibility of Long and Wright.</P1></P></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>ISSUE 1</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Alleged Failure to Consider Evidence</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Law:</UNDER></TI>
<P>47. The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence.</P>
<P>48. Of note, at paragraph 36 of their factum, the appellants argue that a failure to consider relevant evidence is an error of law reviewable on the standard of correctness, and cites two criminal cases, namely <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Morin</SOC><CITE>[1992] 3 SCR 286</CITE></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45</CITE></CASEREF>. With all respect to the appellants, their analysis of these cases is simply not correct. The above cases deal with appeals commenced by crown counsel to overturn acquittals, and the specific requirements of section 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, which provides that acquittals may only be overturned on an error of law. The analysis of appeal courts when specifically considering evidence in relation to the <EM>Code</EM> do not apply in a civil case. Instead, the issue before this honourable court is whether or not the trial judge made palpable and overriding errors of fact in his trial judgment.
<P1>Respondent's Book of Authorities (&ldquo;<BOLD>BOA</BOLD>&rdquo;) Tab 8, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Morin</SOC><CITE>[1992] 3 SCR 386</CITE></CASEREF></P1>
<P1>BOA Tab 7, <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. J.M.H.</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 45</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>49. With respect the appellants' assertion that there was a presumption of resulting trust that ought to have been applied by the trial judge, with all respect, this is not the case either. While the trial judge is to commence his inquiry with the applicable presumption in mind, he is then to weigh all of the evidence in an attempt to ascertain, on a balance of probabilities, the transferor's actual intention. The presumption is only determinative of the result where there is insufficient evidence to rebut it on a balance of probabilities.
<P1>BOA Tab 6, <CASEREF><SOC>Pecore v. Pecore</SOC><CITE>2007 SCC 17</CITE><PARANUM>44</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>50. It is only if the trial judge cannot ascertain the actual intention of the transferor that he is entitled to rely on the presumption of resulting trust.
<P1>BOA Tab 3, <CASEREF><SOC>Fuller v. Fuller Estate</SOC><CITE>2010 BCCA 421</CITE><PARANUM>42</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>51. The factual findings of the trial judge with which the appellants take issue are entitled to deference absent a palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>52. A trial judge's findings of fact are deserving of great deference:
<QUOTE><P>The trial judge is better situated to make factual findings owing to his or her extensive exposure to the evidence, the advantage of hearing testimony viva voce, and the judge's familiarity with the case as a whole. Because the primary role of the trial judge is to weigh and assess voluminous quantities of evidence, the expertise and insight of the trial judge in this area should be respected.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>BOA Tab 5, <CASEREF><SOC>Housen v. Nikolaisen</SOC><CITE>2002 SCC 33</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>53. The Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Housen</EM> emphasized that, where there is evidence to support a conclusion, a difference of opinion over the weight to be assigned to the evidence does not provide a proper foundation for an appellate court to interfere:
<QUOTE><P>Although we agree that it is open to an appellate court to find that an inference of fact made by the trial judge is clearly wrong, we would add the caution that where evidence exists to support this inference, an appellate court will be hard pressed to find a palpable and overriding error. As stated above, trial courts are in an advantageous position when it comes to assessing and weighing vast quantities of evidence. In making a factual inference, the trial judge must sift through the relevant facts, decide on their weight, and draw a factual conclusion. Thus, where evidence exists which supports this conclusion, interference with this conclusion entails interference with the weight assigned by the trial judge to the pieces of evidence (&para;22).</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>54. Put another way, as long as there was some evidence upon which the trial judge could have reached his conclusions, that is sufficient.</P>
<P>55. There are two distinct bases upon which an appellate court can set aside a trial judge's findings of fact which, with respect, the appellant has conflated in its argument. The two considerations are:
<P1>(a) whether the trial judge erred by failing to consider relevant evidence; and,</P1>
<P1>(b) whether the trial judge's reasons for judgment were insufficient.</P1></P>
<P>56. The appellants argue that, in reaching its factual findings, the trial judge failed to consider the evidence of Royce and Mrs. Wright, which failure is allegedly evidenced: a) the unresolved contradictions their evidence presented, and b) the lack of reference to their evidence in the reasons for judgment. With respect, neither of these reasons are sufficient to have an appellant court interfere with a trial judge's findings.</P>
<P>57. Contrary to the position taken by the appellants' in their factum, their argument that the trial judge ignored, forgot, or misconceived relevant evidence is not based on an error of law, but rather, challenges the trial judge's findings of fact.
<P1>BOA Tab 1, <CASEREF><SOC>Bystedt (Guardian ad litem of) v. Hay</SOC><CITE>2004 BCCA 124</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>58. What the appellants really urge in their factum is to have this honourable court find that the trial judge erred because he did not prefer the evidence they advanced over the evidence of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>59. Contrary to the requirements of <EM>Housen</EM>, they do not allege that there exists no evidence upon which the trial judge could have based his findings. Rather, the appellants argue the evidence preferred by the trial judge was contradicted by witnesses called by the defendants and urges this Court to conclude that the failure to refer to the evidence of Mrs. Wright and Royce and to explain the contradictions in their evidence means the trial judge failed to consider their evidence.</P>
<P>60. It is not necessary for a trial judge to resolve conflicts in the evidence if he or she is able to draw a conclusion based on all of the evidence.
<P1>BOA Tab 10, <CASEREF><SOC>Slocan Forest Products Ltd. v. Trapper Enterprises Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2011 BCCA 351</CITE><PARANUM>26</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>61. Where the appellants allege the failure of the trial judge to consider relevant evidence, the appellants bear the onus of demonstrating a failure to consider such evidence. The mere absence of any reference to evidence in reasons for judgment does not establish that the trial judge failed to consider that evidence. The appellant must point to something in the trial record, usually in the reasons, which justifies the conclusion that the trial judge failed to consider certain evidence.
<P1>BOA Tab 11, <CASEREF><SOC>Waxman v. Waxman</SOC><YEAR>2004</YEAR><CITE>186 O.A.C. 201</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> &para;343</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Application:</UNDER></TI>
<P>62. It is clear from the transcripts and exhibits that there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to have made the findings that he did.</P>
<P>63. Whether or not Wright mentioned to Royce that he wanted to have Long named as his nominee for the purpose of the Royalty Agreement is irrelevant, as there was no discussion of how and why Long was being named as the &ldquo;nominee&rdquo;, nor was the agreement that was said to paper the transaction ever shown to Royce in order to obtain his opinion with respect to its sufficiency given any stated intent. While counsel would have this court conclude that the &ldquo;paperwork&rdquo; being referred to was the Blank Agreement, this is a speculative conclusion that the appellants are asking this court to draw.</P>
<P>64. On this very issue, Royce's evidence was as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Q And then my question is, when did you find out from Mr. Wright, if you remember, that Mr. Long was going to have some kind of involvement with respect to the royalty?</P>
<P>A I'm not quite sure of the time, but it was mentioned to me that Gerry wanted to have the royalty recorded in the name of Mr. Long.</P>
<P>Q Yes. And what&mdash;did you have a conversation with Mr. Wright about that?</P>
<P>A Absolutely. I said that it's really a bad idea to do. You don't want to put something in someone else's name because it could only cause problems. I have seen enough family businesses where there's money on the table, everyone forgets what was said, too many on purpose. So I said, &ldquo;If you put it in anyone's name other than your own, make sure that you have paperwork that satisfies you that you retain the interest in that royalty.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Q Can you explain a little bit, though, that Mr. Wright said he wanted to put the royalty, or record the royalty in Mr. Long's name? So what&mdash;did you have any understanding as to whether or not Mr. Long had an interest then, a beneficial interest in the royalty?</P>
<P>A My understanding was that&mdash;only this is what I counseled Gerry&mdash;that if you retain the royalty&mdash;you know, you retain the beneficial interest, make sure that if it's in&mdash;if someone else's name appears, that you cover that off such that anyone looking at it would say, well, it might be in person x's name&mdash;may Long's name&mdash;but I' the one that has beneficial interest. And that was for him to do.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>TEB Tab 32, pp. 869-870, ll. 35&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;21</P1>
<QUOTE><P>Q Mr. Royce, earlier in the day, before the lunch break, you were explaining to us that you had told Mr. Wright on a few occasions that he should make sure paper&mdash;paper the transfer of the royalty. I think you are speaking particularly of Mr. Long.</P>
<P>A Yes.</P>
<P>Q So what did you mean by that exactly when you say &ldquo;make sure you have it papered&rdquo;?</P>
<P>A Well, obviously the entitlement and beneficial interest which would be shareholders of Crew Capital, Gerry Wright was one.</P>
<P>Q Yes?</P>
<P>A
<P1>John Darch and Bob Anderson. So they would be getting the, you know, beneficial interest, all other things being equal.</P1>
<P1>So when Gerry mentioned that he wanted to have David Long as his nominee, I said: Well, just make sure that it is papered properly so that if the intent is that you keep the beneficial interest, then there is some paperwork to support that, notwithstanding the fact that somebody else' name is on it.&rdquo;</P1></P>
<P>Q Now, do you know if any paperwork along those lines was ever drawn up?</P>
<P>A I have no knowledge of it being drawn up, but I stressed it to Gerry several times, and by the end he was saying, &ldquo;Yes, it's taken care of.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Q Did he say anything else with respect to the paperwork?</P>
<P>A Yes, he said that he has paperwork in his safe. So I said, fine, and left it at that.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>TEB Tab 36, pp. 877 to 878, ll. 35&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;19</P1></P>
<P>65. The only time that Royce gave clear evidence that he understood that Long was going to be holding the Royalty as nominee was after a leading question in reexamination.
<P1>TEB Tab 41, pp. 900 to 901, ll. 9&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;3</P1></P>
<P>66. At no time did Royce give unprompted evidence that Wright told him that he was, in fact, retaining 100% of the beneficial interest in the Royalty that had been placed in Long's name. Even if Wright had told Royce this, what is clear from the trial judge's reasons, which are supportable by the evidence at trial, is that he concluded that Wright was capable of putting forward self-serving stories when it suited his needs.
<P1>RAB pgs. 3&ndash;6, Oral Ruling, paras. 5 and 6</P1></P>
<P>67. The only understanding Royce gathered in relation to the nature of Long and Wright's respective interests in the Royalty were provided by Wright. At no time did Royce see any objective evidence related to same.</P>
<P>68. With respect to the evidence of Mrs. Wright, there is no question that the plaintiff did not accept any of her evidence at trial. She was vigorously cross examined and her evidence was heavily tested by the plaintiff. In the end, by virtue of his reasons, it is clear that the trial judge concluded that her evidence was not accepted. This was a reasonable conclusion that the trial judge was entitled to reach based upon the evidence presented at trial. No explanation is required by the trial judge in reaching this conclusion. In addition, it cannot be ignored that Mrs. Wright has a vested interest in the outcome of this action and that her interests are fully aligned with those of the appellants.</P>
<P>69. With respect to the trust issue, it is clear that the trial judge concluded that it was the intention of Wright to gift half of the beneficial interest in the Royalty to Long at the time the Royalty Agreement was entered into. As a result, the trial judge was not obliged to deal with the presumption of resulting trust.</P>
<P>70. While it is the position of the appellants that all three reasons given by the trial judge were contradicted by the evidence, this would only be the case if the plaintiff's evidence had not been believed. Long was providing a service to Wright in holding his half of the beneficial interest in trust which was not dissimilar to many of the &ldquo;services&rdquo; that he had provided to Wright in the past. Of note, Wright shared litigation proceeds with Long on a 50/50 basis for a defamation case he had brought and funded in both their names. With respect to the sheltering of half of the Royalty interest from Mrs. Wright, in the reasoning set out in their factum, the appellants have failed to consider the Canadian tax consequences if the Royalty was held and taxed in Canada. A reasonable and plausible explanation was given for the creation of the Blank Transfer Agreement which was contrary to Wright's assertion that it was to document his 100% beneficial interest in the Royalty.
<P1>TEB Tab 24, pp. 709 to 710, ll. 45&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;12</P1></P>
<P>71. Of note, all of the arguments put forward by the appellants in their factum were made in their written closing submissions and rejected by the trial judge.
<P1>RAB pgs. 54&ndash;70, Outline of Submissions of the Defendants</P1></P>
<P>72. There is nothing in the reasons for judgment which could demonstrate that the trial judge ignored, forgot or misconceived relevant evidence and, as a result, a palpable and overriding error cannot be found. With respect to this aspect of the appeal, the appellants have failed to raise an issue which calls for appellate intervention and this portion of the appeal ought to be dismissed.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Alleged Insufficient Reasons for Judgment</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Law:</UNDER></TI>
<P>73. The appellants allege that the trial judge failed to provide sufficient reasons for judgment because he failed:
<P1>(a) to refer to the evidence of Royce;</P1>
<P1>(b) to attempt to reconcile the evidence of Royce with [the trial judge's] finding that Wright intended to gift the plaintiff 50% of the Royalty;</P1>
<P1>(c) to refer to the evidence of Mrs. Wright; and,</P1>
<P1>(d) to explain contradictions between Mrs. Wright's evidence and the trial judge's findings of fact.</P1></P>
<P>74. In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge identified the issue at trial to be that of conflicting credibility.</P>
<P>75. The primary issue to be determined was: when the Royalty interest was transferred to Long, did Wright retain 100% of the beneficial interest, or was 50% of the beneficial interest gifted to Long. The trial judge resolved this issue in favour of Long, concluding: &ldquo;On the evidence, I think Mr. Long's version of events is more probable.&rdquo;</P>
<P>76. The preference of one witness's version of events may well result in an implicit rejection of evidence to the contrary:
<QUOTE><P>However, in civil cases in which there is conflicting testimony, the judge is deciding whether a fact occurred on a balance of probabilities. In such cases, provided the judge has not ignored evidence, finding the evidence of one party credible may well be conclusive of the result because that evidence is inconsistent with that of the other party. In such cases, believing one party will mean explicitly or implicitly that the other party was not believed on the important issue in the case. That may be especially true where a plaintiff makes allegations that are altogether denied by the defendant as in this case.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>BOA Tab 2, <CASEREF><SOC>F.H. v. McDougall</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 53</CITE><PARANUM>86</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>77. There is no need, much less requirement, that a trial judge analyze the evidence of a witness who he has disbelieved on the major point in the trial:
<QUOTE><P>I do not suggest trial judges are required to mention every factual issue which arises on the evidence. Usually, when a trial judge does not mention an important matter it is permissible to assume that it was considered and weighed.</P></QUOTE>

<P>78. The foregoing presumption&mdash;that a trial judge has considered the evidence in its entirety&mdash;was reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Housen</EM>. In <EM>Housen</EM> the court stated that:
<QUOTE><P>This presumption, absent sufficient evidence of misapprehension or neglect, is consistent with the high level of error required by the test of &ldquo;palpable and overriding&rdquo; error. We reiterate that it is open to the trial judge to prefer the testimony of certain witnesses over others and to place more weight on some parts of the evidence than others, particularly where there is conflicting evidence. The mere fact that the trial judge did not discuss a certain point or certain evidence in depth is not sufficient grounds for appellate interference.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>BOA Tab 5, <EM>Housen</EM> &para;72 (citations omitted)</P1></P>
<P>79. In discussing these same principles in <CASEREF><SOC>Shannon v. Shannon</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court added the following:
<QUOTE><P>It is now settled law that there is no free-standing right of appeal on the adequacy or sufficiency of a judge's reasons. Moreover, even where the logical connection between the evidence and the decision cannot be discerned (i.e., the reasons are objectively inadequate), appellate intervention will not be justified if the record itself permits meaningful appellate review. This is evident from the comments of Mr. Justice Bastarache and Madam Justice Abella, for the majority of a five-judge panel in <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Gagnon</SOC><CITE>2006 SCC 17</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2006] 1 S.C.R. 621</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[13] ... Finding an error of law due to insufficient reasons requires two stages of analysis: (1) are the reasons inadequate; (2) if so, do they prevent appellate review? In other words, the Court [in <EM>Sheppard</EM>] concluded that even if the reasons are objectively inadequate, they sometimes do not prevent appellate review because the basis for the verdict is obvious on the face of the record. But if the reasons are both inadequate and inscrutable, a new trial is required.</P></QUOTE></P></QUOTE>

<P>80. In the case at hand, the reasons for judgment of the trial judge are not insufficient and, even if they were, a review of the record clearly demonstrates an evidentiary basis for his conclusions.</P>
<P>81. In his judgment, the trial judge gave his reasons for preferring the evidence of Long over Wright. Specifically, he held as follows:
<P1>(a) The evidence of Darch was in line with the evidence of Long. Darch was a neutral witness having no bias in favour of either of the parties. He had no financial interest in the outcome of the litigation (AR Tab 26, Reasons, paras. 47 to 50);</P1>
<P1>(b) The representation of a beneficial 50:50 share of the Royalty was consistent with the past friendship and financial business relationship of the parties (AR Tab 26, Reasons, para. 57);</P1>
<P1>(c) Despite being warned to &ldquo;properly paper&rdquo; the true nature of the 50:50 interest arrangement in the Royalty interest to Long, Wright chose not to leave a paper trail, ostensibly for personal domestic and tax reasons (AR Tab 26, Reasons, para. 57);</P1>
<P1>(d) Darch corroborated Long's assertion that Wright preferred a half than a quarter interest in the Royalty (AR Tab 26, Reasons, para. 57);</P1>
<P1>(e) Although Wright is a sophisticated and experienced businessman, he chose not to leave a traceable paper trail about the true nature of the transfer, being concerned about potential taxation consequences if the true nature of the transfer was paper. He could, however, have effected a private declaration of trust document between himself and Long, known only between themselves, which he did not (AR Tab 26, Reasons, para. 57).</P1></P>
<P>82. Of note, with respect to paragraph 81(e) above, the appellants assert that the trial judge erred in his conclusions about the evidence of Mrs. Wright, who is not an independent witness, was entirely aligned with Wright's version of events, which version was expressly rejected by the trial judge. There is no obligation on a trial judge to reference each piece of evidence or to include an analysis of each witness called at trial.</P>
<P>83. Further, it is respectfully submitted that the appellants exaggerate the importance of Mrs. Wright's evidence. The appellants state that it is an error for the trial judge to have found Wright was trying to hide the Royalty interest from Mrs. Wright given that she had been given a copy of the Blank Transfer Agreement.</P>
<P>84. However, while stated as a conclusive fact, one could easily conclude, on the evidence at trial, that Mrs. Wright had not been given a copy of the Blank Transfer Agreement. First, the note from the lawyer says &ldquo;corrected agreement&rdquo;. There was no evidence of a corrected Blank Transfer Agreement outside of the oral evidence of Wright and Mrs. Wright. To the contrary, on the objective evidence, a copy of a corrected Royalty Agreement was produced in the litigation immediately behind the note that was purported to have attached a corrected Blank Transfer Agreement. The argument that the note referred to the Blank Transfer Agreement rather than the corrected Royalty Agreement, is not plausible let alone a palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>85. Even if one were to conclude that Mrs. Wright did have access to the Blank Transfer Agreement, it does not mean that she knew the true nature of how the Royalty was being held by Long or Wright's intentions. The uncontroverted evidence was that Wright was having an affair with Ms. Sanksuwan at that time and that he was talking about moving to Thailand. In addition, the clear evidence from Mrs. Wright was that she did not know how the Royalty was paid for and flat out denied that the funds were transferred from Long to Crew.</P>
<P>86. Further, the allegation that the Blank Transfer Agreement was in Wright's safe in West Vancouver cannot be borne out on the evidence either. The Red Branch Transfer Agreement is a nearly word for word reproduction of the Blank Transfer Agreement. Wright testified that the Blank Transfer Agreement was in his safe in West Vancouver when he drafted the Red Branch Transfer Agreement in Thailand. When asked how he reproduced it so closely from Thailand, he initially claimed to have drafted it from memory. When pushed, he then went onto say that he had a copy of the first page but not the rest. He finally attempted to claim that he had a copy but not the original. Put simply, his version of events kept changing when his evidence was shown to be impossible.

<P>87. This testimony is unbelievable. The only possible explanation is that he had the Blank Transfer Agreement in his possession because it had been removed from the safe, which he never claimed, or that it had never been in the safe to begin with.</P>
<P>88. The trial judge expressly rejected Wright's version of events. The testimony of Mrs. Wright was, obviously, an attempt to exactly re-state that version.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>ISSUE 2</UNDER></TI>
<P>89. The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in law and made palpable and overriding errors of fact, by failing to properly assess the credibility of the plaintiff and Wright.</P>
<P>90. The entirety of the appellants' Factum is based on the contention that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the plaintiff over the evidence of the defendants.</P>
<P>91. While the first issue in their Factum represents an attempt by the appellants to get around the high standard of review for a trial judge's findings of fact, the second issue is a straightforward challenge of the trial judge's credibility assessment.</P>
<P>92. Factual findings of a trial judge based on considerations of the evidence are not subject to appellate interference absent a palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>93. As noted above, where there is some evidence to support the factual conclusions of the trial judge, the appellate court will not substitute its view.</P>
<P>94. In the case at hand, the appellants point to the very evidence accepted by the trial judge at paragraph 56 of their Factum.</P>
<P>95. Paragraphs 57 to 63 of the appellants' Factum consist of references to contradicting evidence advanced by the defendant at trial. The contradicting evidence cited by the appellants is insufficient to establish that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in his assessment of the credibility of Long and Wright at trial.</P>
<P>96. As set out above, there were many examples of gratuitous funding and gifts by Wright to Long, including the splitting of litigation proceeds for which Wright paid 100% of the legal fees. Further, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to find that Wright did not have any intention of paying Canadian taxes on any proceeds generated by the Royalty and, as a result, accepting the half rather than a quarter argument was a reasonable conclusion for the trial judge to come to. Finally, an alternate, plausible explanation was given for the existence of the Blank Transfer Agreement that did not support Wright's assertion that this document was to protect his beneficial interest. Instead, it was the evidence of Long that Wright had him sign this document so that the Royalty could be moved quickly if necessary.</P>
<P>97. It was also made abundantly clear that Wright would say anything at trial in order to provide a self-serving story. Examples of this are as follows:
<P1>(a) Wright insisted that Long had signed the Promissory Note much earlier than February 1999 when all of the objective evidence and the testimony of Darch and Royce established otherwise (TEB Tab 14, pp. 605&ndash;608, ll. 18&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;42; TEB Tab 15, p. 609, ll. 28&ndash;30; TEB Tab 16, p. 610, ll. 5&ndash;8; TEB Tab 10, pp. 560-561, ll. 35&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;36; TEB Tab 11, pp. 579-580, ll. 44&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;10; TEB Tab 21, p. 630, ll. 2&ndash;23);</P1>
<P1>(b) Wright insisted that the Opinion had nothing to do with steps that he took in relation to the Royalty and what he asked of Long (TEB Tab 17, p. 611, ll. 14&ndash;26);</P1>
<P1>(c) Wright insisted that any reference he made to Long in emails to legal counsel was a reference to himself even if he referred to both Long and himself in the same email (TEB Tab 8, p. 552, ll. 17&ndash;42; TEB Tab 9, p. 555, ll. 11&ndash;18; TEB Tab 10, pp. 560-561, ll. 35&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;36; TEB Tab 11, pp. 579-580, ll. 44&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;10; TEB Tab 18, pp. 612-613, ll. 12&ndash;47 &amp; 1; TEB Tab 23, pp. 659-660, ll. 11&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;28);</P1>
<P1>(d) Wright insisted that Long could not have been at the Christening of his daughter since none of his children were Christened and he maintained this position until faced with the certificate of his daughter's Christening (TEB Tab 13, p. 596, ll. 24&ndash;28; TEB Tab 25, pp. 736&ndash;738, ll. 16&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;24); and,</P1>
<P1>(e) Wright insisted that he had never lied to any of his wives about his extramarital affairs, but instead, chose not to talk about what he was doing or avoiding answering questions (TEB Tab 12, pp. 590&ndash;592, ll. 37&ndash;47, 1&ndash;47 &amp; 1&ndash;39).</P1></P>
<P>98. With respect, just because a party can point to portions of the evidence, if believed, would be supportive of its version of events, does not mean that the trial judge must accept that evidence. The trial judge considered all of the evidence tendered at trial and found that the plaintiff's version of events was more plausible than that of the defendants.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<P>I, Gabeba Slamang, paralegal, c/o 1100 - 570 Granville Street, Vancouver, B.C., AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a paralegal with Fraser Litigation Group, lawyers for the respondent/plaintiff in this appeal and, as such, I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. I am advised by Ms. Michelle Tribe, partner of Fraser Litigation Group, and verily believe, that the within appeal is an appeal of an order of Mr. Justice Wong granting the relief sought by the plaintiff at trial, and an order of Mr. Justice Wong awarding the plaintiff special costs of the trial.</P>
<P>3. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Wong, issued November 27, 2015.</P>
<P>4. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Order After Trial of Mr. Justice Wong, dated November 27, 2015 and entered March 30, 2016.</P>
<P>5. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the oral reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Wong regarding the respondent's application for special costs, issued February 9, 2016.</P>
<P>6. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the Order After Application regarding special costs, dated February 9, 2016 and entered March 30, 2016.</P>
<P>7. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the appellants' notice of appeal, filed December 24, 2015.</P>
<P>8. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> is a true copy of the respondent's notice of appearance, filed December 29, 2015.</P>
<P>9. Based upon my review of the pleadings and correspondence between the parties, I can confirm that:
<P1>(a) on February 11, 2016, Ms. Tribe sent a letter to Owais Ahmed, counsel for the appellants, preemptively advising that the respondent would not consent to a waiver or extension of the time periods set out in the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM>, a true copy of which letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(b) on February 22, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe enclosing the appeal record and transcripts filed February 22, 2016, a true copy of which letter without enclosures is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;;</BOLD></P1>
<P1>(c) on March 10, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe enclosing a copy of the filed amended notice of appeal, a copy of which is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</BOLD> I am advised by Ms. Tribe, and verily believe, that, although dated March 10, 2016, the letter was not delivered to Ms. Tribe until March 11, 2016;</P1>
<P1>(d) on March 16, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe requesting that the respondent consent to the filing of a Joint Appeal Book, a true copy of which letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(e) on March 21, 2016, Ms. Tribe sent an email to Mr. Ahmed advising that it would be prudent for the parties to file separate appeal books, a true copy of which email is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</BOLD> I am advised by Ms. Tribe and verily believe that she sent this email from her cellular telephone and that the email contains two autocorrect errors in which the word &ldquo;farm&rdquo; ought to have read &ldquo;factum&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;vault&rdquo; ought to have read &ldquo;vastly&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(f) on March 22, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe advising that he had been operating under the mistaken assumption that the respondent would consent to a joint appeal book and requesting the respondent's consent to a short extension for the filing of the appellants' materials. A true copy of this letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(g) on March 23, 2016, a letter was sent to Mr. Ahmed under Ms. Tribe's name advising that the respondent had, on February 11, 2016, given the appellant notice that no extensions of time would be consented to by the respondent and that the respondent had not agreed to file a joint appeal book. A true copy of this letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(h) on April 4, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe advising that the appellants would bring an application for an extension of time and a stay of execution, and requesting Ms. Tribe's availability. A true copy of this letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(i) on April 4, 2016, Ms. Tribe sent a letter to Mr. Ahmed advising of her availability for the applications and requesting the appellants' application materials within the time set out in the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM>. A true copy of this letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD>;</P1>
<P1>(j) on September 12, 2016, Ms. Tribe sent a letter to Mr. Ahmed requesting his availability for an application in relation to the within matter, a true copy of which letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD>; and</P1>
<P1>(k) on September 13, 2016, Mr. Ahmed sent a letter to Ms. Tribe advising of his availability for the proposed application, a true copy of which letter is attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>10. I am advised by Ms. Tribe and verily believe that, to date, Ms. Tribe has not received the appellants' application materials, factum, or appeal book.</P>

<P>I, Owais Ahmed, Barrister &amp; Solicitor, of 3200 - 650 West Georgia Street, in the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am a lawyer with Harper Grey LLP, solicitors for the Appellants, Red Branch Investments Limited and Gerald Wright herein, and as such I have personal knowledge of the matters and facts herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and as to the latter I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. All of the correspondence exchanged by my office and C. Michelle Tribe, counsel for the respondent (plaintiff) pertaining to this appeal are attached to Affidavit #1 of Gabeba Slamang, sworn September 21, 2016 and filed by the respondent, and I have not therefore attached the same to my affidavit.</P>
<P>3. As set out in my email to Ms. Tribe of April 4, 2016, my intention on that date was to bring an application on behalf of my clients for an extension so that the appellants' materials could be filed and to seek a stay of the execution of the judgment below.</P>
<P>4. It made sense to me for both applications to be heard at the same time, because the test for an extension and a stay of execution both involved the issue of whether the appeal had any merit.</P>
<P>5. Unfortunately, the appellant, Gerald Wright, was out of the country on business in South East Asia (including remote areas of Laos where communication was difficult), and I did not receive an original sworn affidavit from him for use in the application until April 15, 2016. That affidavit was sworn before a consular official in the Canadian Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.</P>
<P>6. However, I determined that further changes needed to be made to Mr. Wright's affidavit and it had to be sworn again. That did not occur until April 28, 2016, by which time Mr. Wright had returned to Canada and I was able to meet with him. A true copy of Mr. Weight's affidavit is attached hereto as Exhibit <BOLD>&ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P>
<P>7. I intended to quickly thereafter file the appellants' application materials. Unfortunately around April 30, 2016, my mother's health began to deteriorate. My mother suffers from medullary sponge kidney disease, and her condition began to worsen significantly around the end of April, 20 16. She is now facing kidney failure and her treatment options are limited.</P>
<P>8. Consequently, I was out of the office from April 30 to mid-May 2016.</P>
<P>9. While I am hopeful that my mother's condition will improve, her condition remains poor to date and that has been very distressing for me.</P>
<P>10. Since my return to the office in mid-May 2016, I have done my best to remain in the office and fulfill my work commitments, despite the emotional stress relating to my mother's health. I regret that I was not successful in this case and that the application for an extension was not brought sooner. The delay is entirely attributable to me.</P>
<P>11. From mid-May 2016 to date, I have been extremely busy at work with a number of court appearances and lengthy hearings before various administrative tribunals. I do not advance my busy work load as an excuse for my failure to bring the appellants' application for an extension soon after Mr. Wright's affidavit was sworn on April 28, 2016, but it has made it more difficult to deal with my mother's health condition and to spend time with her.</P>
<P>12. In hindsight, I acknowledge that I should have had someone else take carriage of the file, but at the time I thought it would be too difficult to bring someone else up to speed on the file given that no other lawyer has worked on it with me and because I believed that I would be able to bring the application sooner despite my mother's health.</P>

<P>1. The respondent/plaintiff seeks an order dismissing the within appeal as abandoned pursuant to section 10(2)(e) and 28 of the <EM>Court of Appeal Act</EM> (&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Act</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;), and an order for its costs of the appeal and this application.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>BACKGROUND FACTS</TI>
<P>2. The plaintiff commenced the underlying action by notice of civil claim on April 16, 2012 claiming that the defendants held one-half of a mineral royalty in trust for the plaintiff, which trust had been breached. The defendants opposed the relief sought by the plaintiff, alleging an alternate version of events in their response to civil claim.</P>
<P>3. Trial of the action was heard over the course of 16 days in 2015. In written reasons for judgment, released November 27, 2015 (<BOLD>&ldquo;Reasons for Judgment&rdquo;</BOLD>), Justice Wong granted judgment in favour of the plaintiff. In preferring the plaintiff's evidence, Justice Wong found that the defendants' held 50% of the royalty interest in trust for the plaintiff, and an order after trial was entered on March 30, 2016 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Trial Order&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>4. On application by the plaintiff, Justice Wong granted the plaintiff special costs of the trial, to be held in a solicitor's trust account pending the outcome of this appeal and an order after application was entered on March 30, 2016 (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Special Costs Order&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>5. The defendants filed a notice of appeal on December 24, 2015, and amended notice of appeal on March 10, 2016, appealing the Trial Order and Special Costs Order.</P>
<P>6. On February 11, 2016, counsel for the plaintiff advised that the plaintiff would not agree to extend any procedural time periods in the <EM>Court of Appeal Rules</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>Rules</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>7. On March 16, 2016, the defendants sought the plaintiff's consent to the preparation and filing of a joint appeal book. By letter dated March 21, 2016, plaintiff's counsel advised that the plaintiff did not consent to a joint appeal book.</P>
<P>8. On March 21, 2016, counsel for the defendants' advised by letter that, as a result of a mistaken assumption that the parties would file a joint appeal book, he was not confident that the defendants would be able to file the appeal book the next day. Counsel for the defendants sought an extension of time, which the plaintiff did not agree to.</P>
<P>9. On April 4, 2016, counsel for the defendants sought plaintiffs' counsel's availability for applications to extend time and a stay of execution. On April 4, 2016, counsel for the plaintiff provided her available dates. Since April 4, 2016, there have been no further communications from counsel for the defendants, nor anyone else on behalf of the defendants. To date, the defendants' factum and appeal book are over 180 days late and no application materials have been received by the plaintiff. The mistaken assumption regarding a joint appeal book is not a plausible explanation for the delay in filing the appeal book, and no explanation for the delay in filing the factum has ever been offered.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>10. Sections 10(2)(e) and 28 of the <EM>Act</EM> grant a justice the authority to dismiss an appeal as abandoned for failure to comply with the <EM>Act</EM> or <EM>Rules</EM>: <CASEREF><SOC>George v. McMahon</SOC><CITE>2008 BCCA 497</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF> (in Chambers) [&ldquo;<BOLD><EM>George #1</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;] <BOLD>[TAB 1],</BOLD> aff'd 2009 BCCA 76 [<BOLD>&ldquo;George #2&rdquo;</BOLD>] <BOLD>[TAB 2].</BOLD></P>
<P>11. In <CASEREF><SOC>Redpath v. Redpath</SOC><CITE>2008 BCCA 400</CITE></CASEREF> (in Chambers), the Court held that the factors to be considered on an application to dismiss an appeal are the <EM>Davies</EM> factors (at &para;15 <BOLD>[TAB 3]</BOLD>): (i) whether there was a <EM>bona fide</EM> intention to appeal; (ii) when the respondents were informed of the intention; (iii) whether the respondents would be unduly prejudiced by an extension; (iv) whether there is merit in the appeal; and (v) the interests of justice.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Bona Fide</EM> Intention to Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. The defendants' failure to prosecute their appeal demonstrates that they no longer have a <EM>bona fide</EM> intention to appeal: <CASEREF><SOC>British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Malik</SOC><CITE>2012 BCCA 58</CITE><PARANUM>28</PARANUM></CASEREF> (in Chambers) <BOLD>[TAB 4].</BOLD></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Prejudice</UNDER></TI>
<P>13. Prejudice can be inferred from a delay which deprives the plaintiff of the benefit of the relief sought, and awarded, at trial: <EM>Redpath</EM> &para;17 <BOLD>[TAB 3]</BOLD>; <EM>George #2</EM> &para;14 <BOLD>[TAB 2].</BOLD></P>
<P>14. This Court has found delays of three and six months to be prejudicial: <EM>Redpath</EM> <BOLD>[TAB 3],</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Casoli v. Hearndon</SOC><YEAR>1984</YEAR><CITE>57 B.C.L.R. 10</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A. in Chambers</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[TAB 5].</BOLD></P>
<P>15. The defendants' factum and appeal book are over 180 days overdue, which delay has deprived the plaintiff of certainty and the relief and costs awarded by Justice Wong.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Merits of Appeal</UNDER></TI>
<P>16. In the case at hand, Justice Wong identified the issue for trial as &ldquo;conflicting credibility between the parties as to their agreed arrangement&rdquo;. After considering all of the evidence, Justice Wong preferred the plaintiff's version of events, and rendered judgment entirely in the plaintiff's favour: Reasons for Judgment &para;5, &para;57&ndash;59.</P>
<P>17. The standard of review on an appeal raising assessments of witness credibility and findings of fact is palpable and overriding error. Due to the high standard of review, the merits of an appeal will generally be considered weak where the issues involve fin dings of fact: <CASEREF><SOC>Manjit International Development Ltd. v. Ng</SOC><CITE>2009 BCCA 429</CITE><PARANUM>10-11</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>[TAB 6];</BOLD> <EM>George #1</EM> &para;28 <BOLD>[TAB 1];</BOLD> <EM>George #2</EM> &para;13 <BOLD>[TAB 2];</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Rainbow Country Estates Ltd. v. Whistler (Resort Municipality)</SOC><CITE>2011 BCCA 38</CITE><PARANUM>11</PARANUM></CASEREF> (in Chambers) <BOLD>[TAB 8].</BOLD></P>
<P>18. A court should set aside a costs award, including an order for special costs, only if the trial judge has made an error in principle or if the costs award is plainly wrong: <CASEREF><SOC>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2004 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>[TAB 9].</BOLD></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Interests of Justice</UNDER></TI>
<P>19. A delay shall not be excused on the basis of busy counsel or complex facts: <EM>Redpath</EM> &para;20 <BOLD>[TAB 3]</BOLD>; <EM>George #1</EM> &para;25 <BOLD>[TAB 1].</BOLD></P>
<P>20. The appellant has failed to comply with the <EM>Act</EM> without satisfactory explanation. The plaintiff is entitled to a timely and final resolution to this matter, as well as the relief and costs awarded at trial. The interests of justice fall in favour of dismissing the appeal.</P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<P>1. The appellants oppose the order sought by the respondent to dismissed the appeal as abandoned, and instead seek an order granting an extension to file their factum, appeal book and transcript extracts pursuant to s. 10(2)(d) of the <EM>Court of Appeal Act</EM>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>BACKGROUND</UNDER></TI>
<P>2. The appellants submit that the relevant background facts are as follows:
<P1>a. The appellants filed their Notice of Appeal within the time provided in the <EM>Rules</EM> on December 24, 2016;</P1>
<P1>b. The appellants filed their appeal record and five volumes of transcripts, at considerable cost, within the time provided in the <EM>Rules</EM> on February 22, 2016;</P1>
<P1>c. On March 16, 2016, counsel for the appellants advised counsel for the respondent that they the appellants would not be referring to a significant number of the exhibits from the trial in their factum, and inquired whether the plaintiff would agree to the parties filing a Joint Appeal Book;</P1>
<P1>d. In the afternoon on March 21, 2016, having not heard back from counsel for the respondent, counsel for the appellants followed up on the inquiry by voice message and email.</P1>
<P1>e. Counsel for the respondent responded by email on March 21, 2016 and advised that it she did not agree to the filing of a Joint Appeal Book</P1>
<P1>f. On March 22, 2016, counsel for the appellant wrote to counsel for the respondent, seeking consent to an extension of two business days.</P1>
<P1>g. The following day, counsel for the respondent advised that the respondent would not consent to any extension.</P1>
<P1>h. On April 4, 2016, counsel for the appellants wrote to advise that he had instructions to bring an application for an extension to file the outstanding appeal materials and to seek a stay of execution of the judgment below. Counsel further advised that the appellant, Gerald Wright, was in Thailand, but attempts were being made to have his affidavit for the application sworn before a consular official in Bangkok.</P1>
<P1>i. As set out in the undersigned's affidavit, Mr. Wright's affidavit was not sworn until April 28, 2016, after he had returned to Canada.</P1>
<P1>j. As detailed in the undersigned's affidavit, in late April, 2016 his mother's health began to deteriorate and he was out of the office in early May, 2016. The undersigned's mother's poor health persists, and it has contributed to the delay.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>ARGUMENT</TI>
<P>3. The factors to be considered on an application to extent the time to taken any steps necessary in the prosecution of an appeal, were set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Davies v. C.I.B.C.</SOC><YEAR>1987</YEAR><CITE>15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256</CITE><PAGENUM>at 259-260</PAGENUM><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, and are as follows:
<P1>a. Was there a <EM>bona fide</EM> intention to appeal?</P1>
<P1>b. When were the respondents informed of the intention?</P1>
<P1>c. Would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time?</P1>
<P1>d. Is there merit in the appeal?</P1>
<P1>e. Is it in the interests of justice that an extension be granted?</P1></P>
<P>4. The fifth question &ldquo;encompasses the other four questions and states the decisive question&rdquo; and &ldquo;the interests of justice factor is not to be applied independently of the other factors: <CASEREF><SOC>Salfinger v. Salfinger</SOC><CITE>2013 BCCA 217</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Perren v. Lalari</SOC><CITE>2008 BCCA 564</CITE><PARANUM>33</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>5. The test for an extension of time to take a step in the prosecution of an appeal is less stringent than the application of the test in the context of an extension of time to appeal or to seek leave to appeal: <CASEREF><SOC>Besic v. Kerenyi</SOC><CITE>2011 BCCA 503</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>The appellants have had a <EM>bone fide</EM> intention to appeal throughout, and the respondents were informed of the intention</TI>
<P>6. The appellants clearly have held a <EM>bona fide</EM> intention to appeal, as evidenced by the timely filing of their Notice of Appeal, Appeal Record, and five volumes of transcripts from the 16 day trial at considerable cost. The respondents have been informed of the intention to appeal by way of the same.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The respondent would not be <UNDER>unduly</UNDER> prejudiced by an extension of time</TI>
<P>7. There is no evidence that the respondent has suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay or will be <UNDER>unduly</UNDER> prejudiced by an extension of time. The respondent was successful at trial, and a declaration was made by the trial that Red Branch Investments Limited (&ldquo;Red Branch&rdquo;) holds 50% of the royalty at issue in the trial on an express, resulting, and constructive trust on his behalf. The delay in the appeal has not frustrated the respondent's trust interest.</P>
<P>8. Moreover, the royalty is not generating and has never generated any returns.</P>
<P>9. Circumstances in which there is no prejudice, and the delay is explained, weigh in favor of granting the appellant's request for an extension. The Court may still disapprove of and discourage the delay by ordering costs to the respondent on this application: <CASEREF><SOC>George v. McMahon</SOC><CITE>2008 BCCA 497</CITE><PARANUM>23</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>The appeal is meritorious</TI>
<P>10. The grounds of the appeal are, <EM>inter alia</EM> as follows:
<P1>a. The trial judge erred in law by ignoring, forgetting, or misconceiving relevant evidence that went to the core of the case, most notably:
<P2>i. The entire evidence of Paul Royce, a neutral witness who was Mr. Wright's accountant at all relevant times. Mr. Royce testified that Mr. Wright told him that David Long held the royalty solely as a nominee. Mr. Royce was an important witness for the defence, but his evidence is not even referred to in the trial judge's decision.</P2>
<P2>ii. The entire evidence of Gail Wright, Mr. Wright's wife. The trial judge found that a 50% interest in the royalty was given to the respondent by the appellant, in part because the appellant wanted to shelter the royalty from his wife. However, Ms. Wright testified that she was always familiar with the existence of the royalty and knew from the beginning that the respondent held the royalty solely as a nominee. Ms. Wright was an important witness for the defence, yet her evidence was not addressed in the trial judge's decision.</P2>
<P2>iii. The trial judge also did not deal with a contemporaneous note from a lawyer to Gail Wright, enclosing a copy of a document that reflected that the royalty had been transferred to Mr. Long. That evidence directly contradicts the respondent's position and the trial judge's finding, that the transfer of the royalty to the respondent was done in part to shelter it from Ms. Wright.</P2></P1>
<P1>b. The trail judge erred in law by failing to properly assess the credibility of the plaintiff and defendants, or in the alternative, explain the rationale for his credibility findings.</P1></P>
<P>11. The threshold on this part of the test is low, and the appellant need only show that the appeal is not bound to fail: <EM>Salfinger</EM> at para. 17. The appellant has more than met that threshold.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>D.</N><TI>The interests of justice</TI>
<P>12. It is submitted that the following are the relevant factors to the court's consideration of the interests of justice, in addition to what is set out above:
<P1>a. The fact the delay was caused by counsel and an explanation has been advanced, militates in favour of the extension being granted: <CASEREF><SOC>Rowan v. Dunwoody &amp; Company</SOC><CITE>1999 BCCA 755</CITE><PARANUM>21</PARANUM></CASEREF>. This is not one of those &ldquo;rare&rdquo; cases in which the failure of counsel should be visited on the client.</P1>
<P1>b. The delay in question from March 23, 2016 to date is less than one year, and is not inordinate: <CASEREF><SOC>Medar v. Ionescu</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 428</CITE><PARANUM>16</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>c. This case is distinguishable from those in which the lawyer has simply said &ldquo;I was too busy to get the factum done&rdquo;: <CASEREF><SOC>Vaugeois v. Budget Rent-A-Car of B.C. Ltd.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 304</CITE></CASEREF>.</P1>
<P1>d. The fact that the appellants have already incurred the cost of transcripts and the appeal record, is an important but not necessarily conclusive factor in favour of allowing an extension of time: <EM>Rowan</EM>, para. 21.</P1>
<P1>e. The finding of breach of trust made against the individual appellant is serious, and his appeal ought to be heard.</P1></P>
<P>All of which is respectfully submitted.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, David P. Long, of [location omitted] SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am the Respondent/Plaintiff in this appeal and have personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. Mr. Justice Wong awarded me special costs in the within action on February 9, 2016. As I understand it, on September 18, 2017, my counsel disclosed the litigation file in this matter for the purpose of the assessment of my special costs (the <BOLD>&ldquo;Litigation File&rdquo;</BOLD>). The Litigation File was only disclosed for the limited purpose of assessing my special costs.</P>
<P>3. I have reviewed the Memorandum of Argument filed by the Appellants on November 1, 2017 and Affidavit #1 of Tiffany Hambrook, sworn November 1, 2017, and it appears that the Appellants are alleging that, based upon their review of the Litigation File, I was not truthful in my testimony at trial when I stated that Mr. John Darch had not provided me with any financial assistance in this litigation and that I had never spoke to Mr. John Darch about the within litigation and that I intentionally misled the trial judge on a material issue.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Payment of Legal Fees</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. With respect to the allegation that Mr. Darch provided me with financial assistance in the litigation, this is simply not the case.</P>
<P>5. As I testified at trial, I was providing consulting services for Mr. Darch and some of his companies, through Western Investments Ltd. (<BOLD>&ldquo;Western Investments&rdquo;</BOLD>), from 2011 until April 2014. At the time that this agreement was entered into, I did not have a bank account anywhere in the world, including Canada. As a result, as a term of my engagement, it was requested by me and agreed to by Mr. Darch, that Western Investments would cause funds that were owing to me to be forwarded to various accounts and entities at my direction in lieu of a regular paycheck provided that I agreed to pay any and all bank charges related to these requests out of my earned salary.</P>
<P>6. I was paid a consulting fee for managing various potential projects in Thailand that varied between $10,000 and $15,000 per month plus a foreign living allowance of $2,700 per month. The project had funding problems and payments were spasmodic and, as a result, I would have to wait until funding was received before I could be compensated for my work and request any payments be made.</P>
<P>7. During the course of my consulting work, at my direction, Western Investments forwarded funds to various parties including my wife and children, and Clark Wilson LLP. Other commitments included Glentoran Academy, a soccer program assisting disadvantaged and disabled children near my home in Belfast and the repayment of a personal loan. At all times any funds that were paid out were funds owing to me for work performed. At no time did I receive an advance in order to make any of these payments. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit is a true copy of a sample of a payment request I sent to Mr. Darch with the relevant account information removed.</P>
<P>8. As agreed, I paid all service and banking fees for all of these transfers and payments out of my earnings.</P>
<P>9. Between March 2012 and December 2013, I earned $307,439.28 for my consulting services in Thailand. Of this amount, between January 13, 2012 and March 17, 2015, I directed $78,420 to be paid to Clark Wilson LLP for my legal accounts.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Communications with Mr. Darch</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. In their argument and supporting affidavit, the Appellants point to a handful of email communications between Mr. Darch, me and my lawyers. In particular, they have pointed to the following emails:
<P1>(a) A June 17, 2012 email from Mr. Darch to me (the <BOLD>&ldquo;June 17 2012 Email&rdquo;</BOLD>) in which Mr. Darch provides extensive evidence and some advice with respect to the conduct of the litigation;</P1>
<P1>(b) A June 18, 2012 email from me to my lawyer, Mr. Barry Fraser, with a copy to both Ms. Michelle Tribe, one of my other lawyers, and Mr. Darch in which I advise that Mr. Darch had documents for my lawyers and requesting that my lawyers meet with Mr. Darch, who I described as &ldquo;a very advantageous, if somewhat reluctant, witness should we go to court.&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(c) A June 28, 2012 email from Mr. Darch to Ms. Tribe and me in which he advised on a meeting he had with Alice, another one third holder of the royalty, and David Anderson, her brother-in-law and lawyer;</P1>
<P1>(d) Two June 28, 2012 emails from Mr. Darch to Ms. Tribe and me in which he advised about communications with Fasken Martineau;</P1>
<P1>(e) A June 30, 2012 email from Mr. Darch to Ms. Tribe and me in which Mr. Darch advised on his attendance at the offices of Fasken Martineau;</P1>
<P1>(f) A December 11, 2012 email from me to Ms. Sekunova in which I ask if we have the documents listed under the Appellants' list of documents as I would like for Mr. Darch to look through them;</P1>
<P1>(g) A December 20, 2012 email from me to Dianne Bishop, then assistant to Ms. Sekunova and Ms. Tribe, copied to Mr. Darch, in which I asked about document production;</P1>
<P1>(h) A December 21, 2012 email from Ms. Bishop to Mr. Darch and copied to me, attaching requested documents;</P1>
<P1>(i) A December 21, 2012 email from Mr. Darch to me and copied to my lawyers, in which Mr. Darch asked about a document found in the Appellants' list of documents;</P1>
<P1>(j) A February 19, 2013 email from me to Ms. Anna Sekunova, one of my lawyers at the time, in which I forwarded the June 17 2012 Email to Ms. Sekunova for her consideration;</P1>
<P1>(k) A February 19, 2013 email from me to Ms. Sekunova in which I forwarded a February 19, 2013 email from Mr. Darch;</P1>
<P1>(l) A February 19, 2013 email from me to Ms. Sekunova to which Mr. Darch was copied;</P1>
<P1>(m) A February 19, 2013 email from Mr. Darch to Ms. Sekunova and me in which Mr. Darch responded to questions from Ms. Sekunova;</P1>
<P1>(n) A February 24, 2013 email from Mr. Darch to Ms. Sekunova and me in which he attached information related to the value of the royalty; and,</P1>
<P1>(o) A March 9, 2015 email from me to Ms. Tribe and Mr. Fraser in which I referenced leaving files in Mr. Darch's office immediately after my examination for discovery in February 2013.</P1></P>
<P>11. The above communications were made during a time when I was in contact with Mr. Darch multiple times per day in relation to the projects that I was providing consulting services on. They were also made over two years before the trial of this action.</P>
<P>12. With respect to any emails sent by or copied to me by Mr. Darch, none of these communications stood out to me at the time that they were sent. In fact, to the best of my recollection, I would quickly scan these emails to determine whether or not they were work related and, if they were not, I would generally take no further action in relation to them other than to forward them to my lawyers in case they contained relevant information.</P>
<P>13. With respect to the June 17 2012 Email, I do not recall reading the entirety of this email at any time. In fact, it was not until I was reviewing my emails communications in February 2013 while preparing for my examinations for discovery that I realized that this email might be of some importance in the litigation. As a result, upon discovering it, I forwarded it Ms. Sekunova for her consideration. Following my forwarding of the June 17 2012 Email, I thought nothing further of it.</P>
<P>14. With respect to the balance of the email communications referred to above, it was my habit to copy Mr. Darch on emails as a means of keeping him advised about matters that pertained to him, such as when he agreed to provide copies of documents to my lawyers that he had in his possession. I also kept Mr. Darch advised about various communications related to document production as I wanted him to have the opportunity to review documents given that he was going to be a witness at trial.</P>
<P>15. Shortly before the trial of this matter was set to commence at the end of March 2015, I did attempt, unsuccessfully, to contact Mr. Darch to confirm that he would still be testifying as a witness as we had not been in communication since April 2014.</P>
<P>16. When preparing for trial in March 2015, I did not turn my mind to nor review any of my previous communications with my counsel or Mr. Darch and, instead, focused on the documents that were to be relied upon at trial. By March 2015 I had forgotten completely about my email communications with Mr. Darch related to anything to do with this litigation, including the June 17 2012 Email.</P>
<P>17. When I gave my evidence at trial, I gave my evidence to the best of my recollection. Specifically:
<P1>(a) When I was asked whether or not Mr. Darch had provided me with assistance in the litigation, I did not consider that he had. While he had met with my lawyers and told me that he was going to provide them with copies of documents that he had in his possession, I did not consider this to be providing me with &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) At no time did Mr. Darch provide me with &ldquo;financial&rdquo; assistance with this litigation;</P1>
<P1>(c) To the best of my recollection, at no time did I meet with Mr. Darch to specifically discuss the issues in this litigation nor did I have litigation specific discussions with him with the exception of a few emails, most of which I did not read. At the time of trial, the only communications that I recalled having with Mr. Darch were to direct him to pay monies owing to me to Clark Wilson for my legal fees and to ensure that confirm that he would be meeting with my lawyers to give them his evidence; and,</P1>
<P1>(d) At the time of trial, I was not certain whether or not Mr. Darch had, in fact, provided copies of documents to my lawyers or where documents that had been produced had originated from, however, I was certain that Mr. Darch had not provided any litigation related documents directly to me.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, C. Michelle Tribe, lawyer, of 1100 - 570 Granville Street, in the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a partner with Fraser Litigation Group, solicitors for the Respondent/Plaintiff in this appeal and I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. In January 2012, Mr. Barry Fraser was a partner and I was an associate with the law firm Clark Wilson LLP (<BOLD>&ldquo;Clark Wilson&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>3. Also in January 2012, Mr. Long consulted with Mr. Fraser and retained Clark Wilson to assist him in his dispute with Red Branch Investments Limited (<BOLD>&ldquo;Red Branch&rdquo;</BOLD>) and Gerald Wright. Upon Clark Wilson's retainer, I assumed conduct of Mr. Long's file under the direction of Mr. Fraser.</P>
<P>4. The Notice of Civil Claim was filed on April 16, 2012 and served on Mr. Wright in his personal capacity on April 23, 2012. Mr. Wright filed his Response to Civil Claim on May 15, 2012.</P>
<P>5. Because Red Branch is a Hong Kong corporation and because the claim did not fall within section 10 of the <EM>Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act</EM>, RSBC 2003, c 28, on August 14, 2012, we filed and served application materials in order to obtain leave to serve <EM>ex juris</EM> the Notice of Civil Claim on Red Branch, which application was ultimately settled by consent. Red Branch and Mr. Wright filed an Amended Response to Civil Claim on September 18, 2012.</P>
<P>6. In the spring of 2012, I became pregnant with my second child, who was due in early December 2012. In late September 2012, due to medical issues, I was forced to take early leave and, in my absence, Ms. Anna Sekunova, a then associate with Clark Wilson, assumed conduct of Mr. Long's file. On September 12, 2012, prior to being placed on disability leave, I prepared and delivered the plaintiff's first list of documents in this matter.</P>
<P>7. The first list of documents of the defendants was not delivered until December 10, 2012. This list of documents did not include any relevant communications related to the royalty with the exception of the June 7, 2010 email from Mr. Wright to Mr. Gabrielson advising that Mr. Long was transferring the royalty to Red Branch.</P>
<P>8. Mr. Wright did not produce any of the other email communications related to the material facts raised in the litigation until May 23, 2013, after his examination for discovery.</P>
<P>9. Prior to my taking leave, I had been in contact with the law office of Fasken Martineau LLP to review their files related to the royalty at issue in this litigation and, more particularly, for which Mr. Long and Mr. John Darch had been their clients. I did not have a chance to review their records before my unplanned leave.</P>
<P>10. On October 26, 2012, Andrew Gabrielson of Fasken Martineau contacted Mr. Long and Mr. Fraser, with a copy to myself, to advise that their file was available for review. Because Ms. Sekunova was new to the file and we were looking for specific documents, despite being on disability leave, I arranged to attend at the offices of Fasken Martineau on November 1, 2012. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit is a true copy of this email exchange.</P>
<P>11. I did in fact attend at the office of Fasken Martineau on November 1, 2012 and reviewed their file materials. Based upon my review, I requested that copies of several documents be made and provided to Clark Wilson for the purpose of this litigation. All of the Fasken Martineau documents produced and relied upon by the plaintiff in this litigation were obtained as a result of my attendance at their office on this date and none of these documents were provided to us by Mr. Darch.</P>
<P>12. Because I was on disability leave, I neither recorded my time nor was the client charged for my attendance at Fasken Martineau's office to review their file.</P>
<P>13. My daughter was born on [date omitted], at which time I started my six month maternity leave.</P>
<P>14. Based upon my review of the file, in my absence, Ms. Sekunova:
<P1>(a) Filed and served a notice of trial for a five day trial set to commence on July 8, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(b) Prepared and served Mr. Long's amended lists of documents dated February 19, 2013 and April 8, 2013;</P1>
<P1>(c) Received the lists of documents prepared by Red Branch and Mr. Wright;</P1>
<P1>(d) Conducted and attended at examinations for discovery on February 20 and 21, 2013; and,</P1>
<P1>(e) Met with Mr. Darch to prepare him as a witness for trial.</P1></P>
<P>15. I returned from my maternity leave on June 3, 2013 and, within days of my return, Ms. Sekunova took an extended sabbatical. As a result, I reassumed conduct of Mr. Long's litigation file.</P>
<P>16. Upon my return to the office, it became clear that it would be impossible for me to prepare this for trial and that insufficient time had been scheduled for same. At the time, it was my view that five days was going to be wholly insufficient for the trial. In addition, I discovered that one of the plaintiff's witnesses, Mr. Mark Andrews, Q.C, was on sabbatical for the year and, as a result, not available to testify. As a result, I sought an adjournment of the July 2013 trial date.</P>
<P>17. The defendants did not consent to such an adjournment and, as a result, a trial management conference was held on June 13, 2013. On June 12, 2013, we filed and served the plaintiff's trial brief, which clearly set out that we intended to call Mr. Darch as a witness and had him scheduled to testify for half a day. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit is a true copy of this trial brief.</P>
<P>18. On June 13, 2013, Master Baker ordered the July 2013 trial of the matter adjourned generally.</P>
<P>19. On September 24, 2013, a notice of trial was filed setting the trial of this matter down for March 30, 2015.</P>
<P>20. Very little happened on this file for the balance of 2013 and all of 2014.</P>
<P>21. In March 2014, Mr. Fraser, myself and two other lawyers left Clark Wilson in order to form our own firm. While Mr. Long chose to remain our client, due to a solicitors lien on his file, his file materials from Clark Wilson were retained by them and not released to us at the time of our departure. As a result, I had none of Mr. Long's file materials, including any correspondence, at our new firm.</P>
<P>22. Prior to the trial of this matter, and without the benefit of the file materials being held at Clark Wilson, I caused to be filed a subsequent trial brief in this matter on March 9, 2015, which brief once again disclosed that Mr. Darch would be a witness for the plaintiff. At the T rial Management Conference heard the next day, I was ordered to provide a summary of the evidence of Mr. Darch, which I did that same day. In the summary I provided Mr. Darch's email address so that the defendants could contact him should they wish. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my Affidavit are true copies of this trial brief and the witness summary I provided to Mr. Owais Ahmed, counsel for the defendants.</P>
<P>23. Mr. Long was not able to clear up the solicitor's lien that Clark Wilson had over his file materials until mid-March 2015 and, as a result, I had to conduct almost all of my trial preparation without the benefit of the file materials that were being held by Clark Wilson. With tri al set to commence on March 30, 2015, I received two boxes of files as well as a USB stick containing the electronic files for Mr. Long's matter on March 19, 2015 and a further box containing further documents on March 23, 2015. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of the letters enclosing these materials.</P>
<P>24. Of note, I was involved in a five day continuation of a summary trial from March 23 to 27, 2015 and, as a result, I had to have the vast majority of my trial preparation complete by March 22, 2017.</P>
<P>25. Given when Mr. Long's file materials were received and my time constraints, there was no means for me to review the entirety of Mr. Long's file while preparing for trial and, more specifically, past correspondence that had taken place between Mr. Long, Mr. Darch and Ms. Sekunova.</P>
<P>26. In preparing for the upcoming trial, I contacted Mr. Darch in early March 2015 who advised me by both email and by way of telephone conversation that he required a subpoena in order to attend at trial, which I prepared and had delivered to him. Attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;G&rdquo; and &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> are true copies of my emails exchange with Mr. Darch, Mr. Long and myself between and March 4 and 9, 2015 and the subpoena which was delivered to Mr. Darch.</P>
<P>27. On November 27, 2105, the trial judge, Mr. Justice Wong, rendered his judgment, finding in favour of the plaintiff and invited counsel to speak to the matter of costs. On February 9, 2016, Mr. Justice Wong heard the plaintiff's application for special costs and granted them on the basis that Mr. Wright's conduct, both pre-litigation and during the trial, was deserving of rebuke. The defendants appealed the trial decision and, as a result, no steps were taken to have special costs assessed until the appeal process had been resolved.</P>
<P>28. The appeal was heard on May 24, 2017 and, on July 12, 2017, the Court dismissed the defendants' appeal. Following this dismissal, I started to take steps to have the special costs assessed. As part of the special costs assessment, the defendants demanded disclosure of the entirety of the plaintiff's file for which he was seeking special costs. Pursuant to the direction set by the Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Gichuru v Smith</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA</CITE></CASEREF>, I caused the entirety of the plaintiff's file to be disclosed to the defendants for which we were seeking special costs. This disclosure was only made for the purpose of assessing special costs and in no way was intended to be a general waiver of privilege over my file.</P>

<P>I, C. Michelle Tribe, lawyer, of 1100 - 570 Granville Street, in the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, SWEAR (OR AFFIRM) THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am a partner with Fraser Litigation Group, solicitors for the Respondent/Plaintiff in this appeal and I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be based on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe the same to be true.</P>
<P>2. Now produced and shown to me and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is the original of an affidavit sworn by John Darch on the 14<SUP>th</SUP> day of December, 2017.</P>
<P>3. I administered the jurat to Mr. Darch.</P>
<P>4. I did not notice, at the time of doing so, and I presume, neither did Mr. Darch, that the affidavit was entitled in the Court below and not in the Court of Appeal. From my discussions with Mr. Darch, I am informed, and do verily believe, that he was well aware that his affidavit was being sworn for use in these Court of Appeal proceedings.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, John Darch, businessman of [location omitted] SWEAR THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am an entrepreneur and businessman, and as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to save and except where stated to be on information and belief and where so stated I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I have been provided with a copy of the application and affidavit in support filed on November 1, 2017, in this matter.</P>
<P>3. I have reviewed those documents and understand from them that it is alleged that I perjured myself and gave false and fraudulent evidence as a witness at the trial of this proceeding.</P>
<P>4. I did not do so. I gave my evidence at trial as honestly and forthrightly as I could, to the best of my understanding of the question and recollection at the time.</P>
<P>5. I did not have and have no reason to lie or to favour David Long or Gerald Wright in the giving of my testimony. I had and have absolutely no financial interest in the outcome of this case. I have not been compensated in any way with respect to either agreeing to give evidence or in giving it.</P>
<P>6. I had relationships with both parties, over the years, sometimes friendly, and sometimes strained.</P>
<P>7. Mr. Wright and I did indeed engage in vituperative litigation, in the years 2002 to 2005, but, obviously, those facts were known to everybody. I was, in fact, cross-examined on that issue, to some extent, by the solicitor for the Defendants.</P>
<P>8. That litigation was satisfactorily settled by way of a confidential settlement agreement. In no way did my previous litigation with Mr. Wright influence my giving of evidence in this action. At all times I was truthful and was not motivated by any animosity arising from my dispute with Mr. Wright or any of the allegations made in my litigation with him.</P>
<P>9. In addition, certain motives were attributed to me by Mr. Wright in his evidence which were not never put to me in my cross-examination, so I was not given an opportunity to deny them, which I hereby do. Now produced and shown to me and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a copy of a transcript in that regard.</P>
<P>10. I became aware of this litigation, at the time it arose, as Mr. Long and I were engaged in business together with respect to certain potash projects in Thailand. That relationship was also disclosed in my evidence.</P>
<P>11. I felt at the time that, having been involved in the events giving rise to this litigation, after being asked by Mr. Long to provide my evidence, I felt that I had an obligation, simply as a person, to make my evidence available, so that any result of the litigation would be based on complete and truthful facts.</P>
<P>12. In fact, my wife and I had a severe disagreement over my getting involved. She told me she was frightened of Mr. Wright and what he might do in revenge for my testifying, and she urged me to stay out of things. I told her, and I still believe, that I had an obligation to make my knowledge available in the process.</P>
<P>13. As it turned out, I was never contacted by Mr. Wright or his solicitors to discuss what my evidence would be or what I would have to say. Had I been so contacted, I would have told them exactly what I said in evidence and answered any questions they asked. I had nothing to hide.</P>
<P>14. As indicated, I had been involved in litigation with Mr. Wright, and I knew him, therefore, in the conduct of litigation, to be aggressive. In addition, knowing what Mr. Wright had told me, I considered his position in the immediate action to be dishonest. I considered that Mr. Long was at a disadvantage in this litigation, not being aware of the documentary trail that existed and, as a result, I wanted to make sure that he was aware of all of the potential evidence that existed based upon what I considered to be the true facts.</P>
<P>15. It is alleged that I gave false and fraudulent evidence in the following respects:
<P1>(a) I gave evidence that I only discussed the litigation with Mr. Long or his lawyers in early 2012, prior to the commencement of the litigation;</P1>
<P1>(b) I gave evidence that I was unbiased, and had no interest in the litigation;</P1>
<P1>(c) I gave evidence that I was a reluctant witness; and</P1>
<P1>(d) I gave evidence that I did not provide assistance, financial or otherwise to Mr. Long in the litigation.</P1></P>
<P>16. Mr. Long and I began working together, following a chance meeting in 2011. Previously, I knew him only casually through Mr. Wright. At the time, I was engaged in a number of projects in the potash industry in Thailand.</P>
<P>17. Timing, politics, and other considerations made potash potentially very profitable in Thailand and at the time I was considering pursuing a number of potash projects in Thailand. As a result, I needed a professional with international administrative and management experience to be based in Bangkok and administer the various projects on behalf of the companies which owned them.</P>
<P>18. Mr. Long seemed, to me to be ideally suited for the project. Now produced and shown to me and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit is a copy of his Curriculum Vitae which he provided to me as our discussions progressed.</P>
<P>19. I reached an arrangement with Mr. Long, whereby he was paid varying amounts for his consulting and management services in Thailand. His basic pay was a consulting fee of $10,000 per month plus a monthly living allowance. That increased as further projects were added, by $2,500 per month, per project. I considered that those consulting fees were commensurate with what he would be doing for the companies, the responsibility he would have, and also in keeping with the market for such management services as an expatriate in Thailand.</P>
<P>20. I had also been involved in business with Mr. Wright at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation. He had told me that Mr. Long owned 50% of the royalty in question, on a number of occasions.</P>
<P>21. I had also been involved in giving instructions to Messrs. Faskens and Martineau in connection with certain transactions surrounding the royalty, namely the protection of the rights of the royalty holders and the renegotiation of the royalty agreement when Asia Pacific Resources was acquired by a Thai company.</P>
<P>22. While reluctant and apprehensive at the outset about being a witness, having been requested by Mr. Long, I was of the view that I would provide evidence given that I was directly and personally involved, in the matters giving rise to this litigation. I had discussed them with Mr. Wright, he had told me certain things about his intentions with his share of the royalty, including to gift half of it to Mr. Long. I understood he was structuring his affairs in such a way as to avoid paying income tax and to conceal his interest in the royalty from his wife, from whom he intended to leave.</P>
<P>23. Although I bear no animosity towards Mr. Wright, and we settled our litigation, I have, and I had, as a result of my dealings with him and what he had told me, a low opinion of what he was trying to do to Mr. Long. It was, and is my opinion, that Mr. Wright is a man of considerable wealth who could afford expensive and debilitating litigation in order to deny Mr. Long what I understood Mr. Wright had given him. In my experience and opinion, in litigation Mr. Wright had the ability to be manipulative and extremely aggressive.</P>
<P>24. Based on my knowledge of the facts, Mr. Wright's position that Mr. Long had no interest in the royalty was a total lie and a fabrication. It was my view, based on things said to me, and based on my personal involvement, that Mr. Long did indeed have a 50% interest in the royalty.</P>
<P>25. I was of the view that my knowledge would contribute to establishing the truth. I expected Mr. Wright would lie, about the agreements he made, and I felt that I had an obligation to contribute my evidence to enable the truth to be established.</P>
<P>26. I also felt that Mr. Long was inexperienced in Canadian litigation, and would be unprepared to deal with somebody as aggressive as Mr. Wright. I felt it proper to give him my information and my views, so he and his lawyers could consider as to how best to conduct themselves. In fact, Mr. Long's nativity about Canadian litigation is what led me to send him an email dated June 17, 2012, discussed below.</P>
<P>27. It is not true, as alleged in these proceedings, that I offered and provided assistance over the period from June 2012 to February 2013. In fact, to the best of my recollection, I was involved in this matter on four separate occasions: June 2012; December 2012; February 2013; and shortly prior to trial.</P>
<P>28. It is entirely and categorically untrue that I provided financial assistance, or that my companies did, by paying Mr. Long's legal fees. Mr. Long, who was neither a Canadian citizen nor a Canadian resident but was residing in Bangkok, did not have a bank account he could readily employ. As indicated, he was being paid $10,000 per month (plus a monthly living allowance), which I felt was an appropriate level of compensation.</P>
<P>29. I made an arrangement, therefore, with Mr. Long, that his fees would be deposited into a bank account in the name of my company, and that I would distribute funds from that account as he directed, by wire transfer or otherwise. Now produced and shown to me and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this my affidavit are copies of various documents reflecting that arrangement.</P>
<P>30. Any funds paid to Clark Wilson or Fraser Litigation were paid from Mr. Long's remuneration on his written instructions. In fact, on Mr. Long's behalf, I sent money to various places, including to people and institutions in Ireland, to his sister and, occasionally, to Clark Wilson.</P>
<P>31. The money I sent was always Mr. Long's money, I simply sent it when and where he directed me to do so. I also always insisted that he pay any bank charges arising out of the arrangement which, as a result of proceeding in that fashion were often in the amount of several hundreds of dollars.</P>
<P>32. Any funds which were forwarded to Clark Wilson on the instructions of Mr. Long were Mr. Long's funds, representing fees paid to him under his contract with me and my companies. It is totally and absolutely untrue that I provided any financial assistance, paid any of his legal bills, or had any financial interest, involvement, or stake in this litigation or its outcome. Any and all funds provided from that bank account to Clark Wilson were Mr. Long's money, distributed as he directed.</P>
<P>33. I also stand by my assertion that I provided no assistance to Mr. Long in this litigation. I considered assistance, when I was asked that question, to be something concrete, such as the arranging for counsel, a contribution to legal fees, or, as was put to me in cross-examination, creating a job for Mr. Long so that he would have the wherewithal to fund this litigation.</P>
<P>34. I did not consider it providing assistance to Mr. Long to be a witness and, as a witness, to advise both he and his lawyers as to what my evidence was and as to what documents I was aware of, as a witness, which would be relevant to the litigation. In my view, that is the obligation of every witness, and I did not, and do not view that as providing assistance to Mr. Long in the litigation, but rather as doing my duty. I alluded to that view in my evidence at trial.</P>
<P>35. I certainly met with Mr. Long's lawyers to prepare my evidence both in June 2012, February 2013, in anticipation of a July 2013 trial date, and then again in March 2015, shortly before the actual trial in the matter. When we met, and prepared my evidence, we prepared with respect to the events relevant to the litigation. In meeting before trial, we reviewed various documents which had been produced in the litigation. We did not review any of the emails which have been attached to the affidavit of Tiffany Hambrook, we did not discuss events between us or between Mr. Long and I that had taken place in 2012 and early 2013, and we did not prepare any evidence with respect to communications I had had with Mr. Long or his lawyers prior to or during the course of the litigation.</P>
<P>36. When I first met with Mr. Long's lawyers in June 2012, provided them with copies of emails that I had in my possession that were relevant to Mr. Long's royalty claim, which documents were produced by Mr. Long in his list of documents. I also provided them with a sealed envelope that Mr. Long had asked me to give to them. To this day, I have no idea what was contained in that envelope that I gave to his lawyers.</P>
<P>37. Accordingly, when I was questioned in those areas, based upon my understanding of what was being asked of me, I gave my answers to the best of my recollection and belief, but without any review of the events themselves having taken place.</P>
<P>38. As indicated, to the best of my recollection, I was not involved in this matter over the period of June 2012 to February 2013 as alleged. In fact, I was involved in this matter, prior to trial and preparation for trial, only on the three occasions referred to in paragraph 27: June 2012, December 2012 and February 2013.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>JUNE OF 2012</UNDER>:</TI>
<P>39. In the period between June 17, 2012, and June 30, 2012, I met with Mr. Long's lawyers, I met with the Andersons, I provided certain emails to Mr. Long's lawyers, and I sent my lengthy email of June 17, 2012.</P>
<P>40. When I gave my evidence, I said that I had met with Mr. Long's lawyer and discussed matters with Mr. Long prior to the commencement of proceedings. In reviewing the record, it appears that my recollection at trial was in error as I have since been shown that the proceedings were commenced in April, and I have viewed my June 17 email which contains comments on the pleadings.</P>
<P>41. My recollection as to timing was incorrect, but that was my memory at the time. Indeed, I had forgotten, when I gave my evidence, even sending the June 17 email. I had never discussed it with anyone, including Mr. Long. I did not provide it to Clark Wilson, and I did not discuss it with them when we met.</P>
<P>42. In addition, at the time of my cross-examination, my understanding of what counsel for Mr. Wright meant when he referred to the &ldquo;commencement of proceedings&rdquo; was a bit vague. As I alluded to in my June 17 email, my view is that there is a process of the discovery of facts and documents, following which a decision is made as to whether or not to go to trial, and that is when the litigation truly gets underway or commences. Plus, the proceeding of the trial, which is what I had understood he was referring to, had been ongoing for several days before I took the stand.</P>
<P>43. My appreciation for what was meant by the term &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; aside, although I now see that I had my meetings after the filing of the pleadings, I still have a recollection of discussing with Mr. Long starting the lawsuit prior to him doing so, but I can see from emails that I must be mistaken.</P>
<P>44. By the time of the trial, my contact with Clark Wilson was over two years earlier. I had not reviewed these documents or emails dealing with those matters, and my memory was vague. I answered the questions I was asked to the best of my ability and as honestly as I could. Very specific questions were asked which I answered to the best of my ability. If my memory is correct, I had a discussion with Mr. Long prior to him starting his lawsuit. At no time did I say this was the only time I had discussed the lawsuit with Mr. Long or his lawyers.</P>
<P>45. In any event, during that June period, I met with Ms. Tribe. I volunteered that information at trial.</P>
<P>46. Before March 2015, Ms. Tribe and I only met on June 18, 2012 and then had a follow up conversation by phone. I also met with Ms. Anna Sekunova in February 2013.</P>
<P>47. During that time period, being June 2012, at their request, I also met with Alice Anderson, and her brother-in-law David, who is a lawyer and was assisting Ms. Anderson in relation to her royalty interest. Her husband Bob had died, and, accordingly, I met with Alice and her brother-in-law. I also referred to that meeting in my evidence.</P>
<P>48. I did not say that I had obtained the emails myself because I was not asked whether I had. I did not obtain any other documents from Faskens Martineau, but left that up to Mr. Long and his lawyers.</P>
<P>49. In my evidence, I did not mention the email of June 17, 2012 and I did not specifically recall it. In addition, I was not asked about the further dates and nature of my communications with Mr. Long in relation to this litigation. As I said, I have never discussed it with anyone, however, if I had been asked if I had further communications with Mr. Long, after early 2012, I would have confirmed that I had. In addition, this email was not fresh in my memory as it was not discussed at any of my meetings with Clark Wilson, Fraser Litigation Group or with Mr. Long.</P>
<P>50. As stated above, I considered Mr. Long to be naive insofar as Canadian litigation was concerned. When he informed me that he has commenced his claim, he told me that he anticipated the resolution of the matter to be a relatively simple process. Specifically, he told me that he thought he would simply be required to swear and affidavit and that the true ownership of the royalty would be determined by the court on a simple application. As a result, I felt compelled to warn him about what to expect from the Canadian litigation process.</P>
<P>51. The email is lengthy as I wanted to ensure that Mr. Long not only knew what my evidence was, but that he was sufficiently warned about the endeavour that he was embarking upon. As a result, I drafted this email to provide Mr. Long with all my thoughts on the events and on Mr. Wright, and how he conducted litigation, so that Mr. Long and his lawyers, without me, could make what use of it they wished. These words were simply my thoughts on how the litigation might unfold and my suggestions of how I might approach the litigation, no more and no less.</P>
<P>52. I did not follow it up, I did not raise the email or its suggestions with anyone and until this application, I did not even know Mr. Long had forwarded it to his lawyers. From the emails produced, I can see that he did so in February of 2013.</P>
<P>53. I also note that at paragraph 21(a) of the memorandum of argument filed by Mr. Wright's lawyer in this appeal that it is alleged that I stated that: &ldquo;it was the task of David Long and Darch to &ldquo;jointly&rdquo; educate the plaintiff's lawyers on the points set out in Darch's email.&rdquo; This is simply a misreading of my email as I specifically stated: &ldquo;It is not possible so <UNDER>you</UNDER> must educate <UNDER>them</UNDER> [being his lawyers] and then &ldquo;jointly&rdquo; <UNDER>you and they</UNDER> have to filter out those that support your case. At no time did I suggest that I would be involved in any capacity other than to provide evidence as a witness.</P>
<P>54. Similarly, in paragraph 21(h) of the memorandum of argument, Mr. Wright and his counsel misconstrue both the contents and intent of my statement wherein I stated that I had to be the last witness and &ldquo;the one who ties a bow on the case.&rdquo; As the paragraph continues, because of my previous disputes with Mr. Wright, I did not feel that my evidence alone would prove Mr. Long's case and that he could only rely on me being a truthful witness to corroborate what Mr. Long would have to prove through documents and otherwise.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>DECEMBR OF 2012:</UNDER></TI>
<P>55. I was not involved again until five and a half months later, in December of 2012. On the 21<SUP>st</SUP> of December, I reviewed documents from the List of Documents, provided to me by Clark Wilson. The same day I replied referring to one document. I do not recall what that document said, and I do not recall what documents I reviewed or who made arrangements for me to do so.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>FEBRUARY OF 2013:</UNDER></TI>
<P>56. The third occasion of my involvement was in an exchange of emails between February 19 and 25<SUP>th</SUP>, 2013, which emails were sent at the verbal request of Ms. Anna Sekunova, counsel for Mr. Long at that time. The email of February 19<SUP>th</SUP>, provided information about the value of royalty for potash, so Mr. Long would not be fooled into thinking it was worthless. The email of February 25 provided information relevant to my relationship with Mr. Wright, as I said in that email &ldquo;as I may be called upon to be a witness.&rdquo; If I was going to testify, I felt Mr. Long's lawyer should be aware of matters as to my relationship with Mr. Wright, upon which I expected I would be cross-examined. I did not discuss either of those emails with anyone, that I recall, although I discussed these matters as well, in 2015, when preparing for trial.</P>
<P>57. Indeed, February of 2013, was my last involvement until just prior to trial in March 2015. I met with Mr. Long's lawyers to prepare my evidence and I had a number of phone calls.</P>
<P>58. I had not seen Mr. Long since April 2014, when we parted ways in our business. I made it clear, when I telephoned Ms. Tribe, to discuss giving my evidence, that I would only testify if I was under subpoena. That insistence was as a result of a further conversation with my wife, and I felt it was prudent. I had no interest in the outcome of the litigation, and thought it would be appropriate for me to be subpoenaed.</P>
<P>59. When I testified, while I had prepared on the merits of the issues, I had not prepared at all on issues of my contacts between Mr. Long, me, and his lawyer, two years earlier. I gave my evidence as truthfully as I could.</P>
<P>60. If my evidence was mistaken, such mistakes were inadvertent. I gave my evidence as honestly as I could, based on what I then recalled.</P>
<P>61. I understood my role was to answer questions, not to argue, not to volunteer information, and not to try to persuade, but simply to answer the precise questions asked of me as simply as possible, and that is what I attempted to do.</P>

<P>I, Gerald D. Wright, Businessman, of [location omitted] [location omitted] MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:</P>
<P>1. I am one of the appellants in this matter and am an officer and director of the other appellant Red Branch Investments Limited (<BOLD>&ldquo;Red Branch&rdquo;</BOLD>), and as such I have personal knowledge of the matters and facts herein deposed to save and except where the same are stated to be made upon information and belief and as to the latter I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>2. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in engineering from Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1974, and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in engineering from the same university in 1978.</P>
<P>3. I immigrated to Canada in 1979 and have worked in the mineral resource industry since that time.</P>
<P>4. I have reviewed Affidavit #1 of John Darch, sworn December 14, 20 17, and make this affidavit in response. He has spent a significant amount of time restating his evidence from the trial in his affidavit, including his statement that I told him that it was my intention to share the royalty in question with Mr. David P. Long. I responded to his evidence at the trial during my own testimony, and I therefore decline to repeat my evidence again. Simply put, I do not agree that I ever told him anything of the sort.</P>
<P>5. However, he has made some serious new assertions against me in his affidavit, to which I feel compelled to respond. At paragraph 12 of his affidavit, Mr. Darch states that his wife was frightened by me and what I might do in revenge for Mr. Darch testifying. I have never physically threatened Mr. Darch or any other members of his family, and I have no idea what the basis of that statement is. I do not believe that I have ever given Mr. Darch or any member of his family any reason to be &ldquo;frightened&rdquo;.</P>
<P>6. Moreover, I never attempted to even speak to Mr. Darch once it became clear that he was going to testify at the trial, let alone try and dissuade him from doing so.</P>
<P>7. It is the case that Mr. Darch and I were involved in litigation against one another relating to the dissolution of our long-term business dealings. Both sides made serious allegations against one another in that litigation, and the litigation was ha rd fought and pursued vigorously by both parties. However, the dispute was eventually resolved by way of a settlement and the matter never even went to trial. Mr. Darch and I have not been involved in any other litigation against one another.</P>
<P>8. Mr. Darch nonetheless asserts at paragraph 23 of his affidavit that in &ldquo;his experience and opinion, in litigation, [I] had the ability to be manipulative and extremely aggressive&rdquo;. Despite the seriousness of the allegation that I have been &ldquo;manipulative&rdquo; in litigation with him in the past, Mr. Darch has again failed to provide any concrete details to explain exactly what his &ldquo;experience and opinion&rdquo; is based on. It is therefore impossible for me to respond, other than to say that his accusation is not true and I disagree with his characterization of me.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">I. <UNDER>Position Statement of the Respondent</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. This is an application to introduce fresh evidence, and essentially set aside both a trial judgment, and a judgment of this Court due to alleged perjury, or fraud. When such issues arise, the law strives to maintain a tension between its need for finality in its determinations, and a need to protect its processes from fraudulent abuse.</P>
<P>2. This Application and these Appellants are precisely the type of litigant and Application against which, in resolving that tension, the court tries to guard. The Appellants Wright has a history of aggressive litigation, and excessive and scandalous allegations. Such allegations have, in fact, earmarked his positions in this case.</P>
<P>3. The law has developed a test to ensure that both the need for finality and the need to prevent abuse are weighed and considered on applications of this nature. The test is as follows:
<P1>(a) The Appellants must establish perjury, on a balance of probabilities;</P1>
<P1>(b) It is actual perjury that must be established, which is the deliberate giving of false evidence with the intent to mislead the court, not simply inaccuracies or mistakes in evidence;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Appellants may not raise any such allegations about which he knew at the time of trial, or about which he ought to have known with the appropriate exercise of due diligence; and</P1>
<P1>(d) The allegations, if established, must be as to evidence which was material to the decision in question.</P1></P>
<P>4. This application fails to meet all four grounds of the test.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">II. <UNDER>Facts</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The Applicant applies to introduce fresh evidence and to set aside the decision of this Honourable Court made July 12, 2017. The fresh evidence, it is said, discloses perjury on behalf of both the Plaintiff, David P. Long, and a witness called on his behalf, one John Darch. The perjury which is claimed focuses on the degree of involvement of Mr. Darch in assisting the Plaintiff with his case. It is claimed that the fresh evidence will show:
<P1>(a) Mr. Darch and the Plaintiff lied about whether financial assistance was provided by Mr. Darch by way of the payment of the legal fees of the Plaintiff; and</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Darch and the Plaintiff lied about Mr. Darch providing assistance to the Plaintiff and his lawyers with respect to the conduct of the litigation.</P1></P>
<P>6. It is the position of the Plaintiff that the fresh evidence ought not to be permitted. Perjured evidence is evidence given, knowing it to be false, in order to mislead the court. Perjured evidence does not consist of answers to questions which are less than perfect, or which are less than perfectly accurate in all particulars. It is acknowledged that witnesses make mistakes, that memories get confused, that distant events are difficult to recall, and that such evidence, while suffering from frailty, is neither perjury, nor fraud.</P>
<P>7. The evidence reveals in fact that those witnesses disclosed, in their testimony, many of the facts, of which the Appellants now claim they were ignorant. Moreover, the Appellants must be taken to know that witnesses to be called by the opposing party routinely discuss matters with that party or their lawyers, provide or review documents with them, summarize their evidence, and prepare to give testimony.</P>
<P>8. As will be discussed later, the fact that Mr. Darch was going to testify was disclosed on a number of occasions to the Defendant but the Defendant chose not to interview him, not to discuss with him what evidence he might give, and did not pursue the matters of which he now complains to have been unaware on discovery.</P>
<P>9. In any event, the essential finding of the trial judge, that Mr. Darch did not have an interest in the litigation is unassailable. A determination of credibility depends on a whole host of factors. To the extent there are some minor inaccuracies in the evidence of Mr. Darch and the Plaintiff, those are not sufficient to have any effect on the basic decision as to credibility, preferring the evidence of and on behalf of the Plaintiff, in its totality, to that of the Defendant.</P>
<P>10. In their Memorandum of Argument, the Appellants point to:
<P1>(a) A number of documents indicating Mr. Darch or his companies appear to have been paying the Plaintiff's legal fees;</P1>
<P1>(b) A number of emails in the period of June 12, to June 30, 2012, in which Mr. Darch discussed and forwarded certain documents to the Plaintiff's lawyers and discussed both the case and his evidence;</P1>
<P1>(c) The forwarding of some documents to Mr. Darch, by the lawyers for the Plaintiff, in December 2012, for his review; and</P1>
<P1>(d) Two emails in February, 2013, discussing the value of the royalty at issue in the proceedings, and discussing attacks the Plaintiff would make upon Mr. Darch.</P1></P>
<P>11. In terms of the alleged payment of legal fees by Mr. Darch, the allegation of the Appellants is simply untrue. In terms of the emails of June, December, and February, the Appellants do not assert that if the contents of the emails dealing with the merits had been revealed, that would have affected the outcome. In fact, the contents of the emails, in so far as they touch on the merits, are consistent with the evidence of Mr. Darch and the Plaintiff, and are consistent with the findings of the learned trial judge. Rather, it is the fact alone of the emails that the Appellants claim supports the allegation of perjury or fraud which would change the outcome of the case. That this so is said to be because of these findings:
<P1>(a) Findings of the trial judge;
<QUOTE><P>[47] Mr. John Darch, who was a long-time business associate of Mr. Wright and a fellow Royalty holder testified that he knew that Mr. Wright was appointing Mr. Long as his nominee for the royalty and that he clearly told Mr. Darch that he was sharing this royalty with Mr. Long. Mr. Darch also said that Mr. Wright told him that he would rather receive half of the royalty than one quarter, the reason being that he would lose half to Canada Revenue Agency and he would have to share the other half with his wife Gail whom he was planning to leave for his Thai mistress. Mr. Darch said that Mr. Wright told him this on more than one occasion.</P>
<P>[50] Mr. Darch is a neutral witness, having no bias in favour of either of the parties. He has no financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.</P>
<P>&ldquo;[57] On the evidence, I think Mr. Long's version of events is more probable.</P></QUOTE>
<P2>1) The representation of a beneficial 50:50 share of the royalty is consistent with the past friendship and financial business relationship of the parties.</P2>
<P2>2) Despite being warned by Mr. Darch about &ldquo;properly papering&rdquo;, the true nature of a shared 50:50 interest arrangement in the royalty transfer to Mr. Long, Mr. Wright chose not to leave a paper trail, ostensibly for personal domestic and taxation reasons. Mr. Darch in effect corroborated Mr. Long's assertion that Mr. Wright initially preferred a &ldquo;better a half than ultimately a quarter&rdquo; interest in the royalty.</P2>
<P2>3) Although Mr. Wright is a sophisticated and experienced businessman, he chose not to leave a traceable paper trail about the true nature of the transfer. He was concerned about potential taxation consequences if the true nature of the transfer was papered. However, he could also have effected a private declaration of trust document between himself and Mr. Long, known only between themselves.&rdquo;</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) Findings of the Court of Appeal.
<QUOTE><P>[31] John Darch described himself as a businessman. He was closely associated with Wright at the time the royalty interest was acquired and then transferred to Long. While Darch subsequently had a falling out with Wright and was involved in acrimonious litigation with him and thereafter hired Long as a consultant, he denied counsel's suggestion that his testimony was motivated by animosity toward Wright. He denied any interest in the outcome of the litigation. The trial judge, having had the advantage of taking the measure of the witness, found, at para. 50:</P>
<P>Mr. Darch is a neutral witness, having no bias in favour of either of the parties. He has no financial interest in the outcome of this litigation.</P></QUOTE></P1></P>
<P>12. The determination of credibility was based on a number of facts as found by the Learned Trial Judge:
<P1>(a) Mr. Long received a share of 50% of settlement proceeds from aggressive litigation conducted in Ireland, even though entirely paid for by Mr. Wright, indicating their business relationship;</P1>
<P1>(b) The oral 50/50 arrangements as to the royalty reflected the close business relationship between Mr. Wright and Mr. Long;</P1>
<P1>(c) Mr. Wright did not reveal any personal interest in the royalty, to Faskens Martineau DuMoulin LLP (&ldquo;Faskens&rdquo;) and, in fact purported to be acting as the agent for Mr. Long, Fasken's named client;</P1>
<P1>(d) Mr. Wright provided information to Mr. Long which would be relevant only to an owner of an interest in the royalty;</P1>
<P1>(e) Mr. Darch was a neutral witness, having no bias in favour of either of the parties, with no financial interest in the outcome of the litigation;</P1>
<P1>(f) Mr. Anderson confirmed that Mr. Wright had told him that Mr. Long owned the royalty and that he was acting only as Mr. Long's agent;</P1>
<P1>(g) Mr. Wright gave similar advice to Mr. Gabrielson and Mark Andrews, Q.C.</P1></P>
<P>13. In the end, the Learned Trial Judge concluded that Mr. Long's version of events was more probable than Mr. Wright's in as much as:
<P1>(a) It &ldquo;was consistent with the past friendship and the business relationship&rdquo;;</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Wright created no documents to reflect the arrangements he claimed existed, despite being a sophisticated and experienced businessman; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Mr. Darch corroborated Mr. Long's assertion that the structure was set up by Mr. Wright to conceal true ownership, in order to avoid domestic issues and tax consequences.</P1></P>
<P>14. This Honourable Court made the following findings:
<P1>(a) The Learned Trial Judge accepted Mr. Long's evidence;</P1>
<P1>(b) The Learned Trial Judge referred to accepting Mr. Darch's evidence that he had advised Mr. Wright to paper the transaction;</P1>
<P1>(c) The Learned Trial Judge relied on the various lawyer's evidence;</P1>
<P1>(d) With respect to Mr. Darch, having had the advantage of taking the measure of the witness, the learned trial judge found him credible;</P1>
<P1>(e) Mr. Darch denied any animosity towards Mr. Wright;</P1>
<P1>(f) Mr. Darch denied any interest in the outcome of the litigation; and</P1>
<P1>(g) Mr. Darch's evidence was not dis-similar to that of Mr. Royce, Mr. Wright's accountant.</P1></P>
<P>15. In his special costs decision, Mr. Justice Wong found Mr. Wright's conduct was reprehensible and deserving of rebuke on the basis, that:
<P1>(a) His conduct pre-litigation in denying the trust arrangement was a fraud;</P1>
<P1>(b) He alleged that Mr. Long commenced the action as a means of engaging in a campaign of harassment;</P1>
<P1>(c) His defence was without merit and constituted obfuscation of the major issues;</P1>
<P1>(d) He put forward a self-serving story, coupled with character aspersions which were reprehensible.</P1></P>
<P>16. Those aspersions continue, and it is now alleged that both Mr. Long and Mr. Darch, the independent witness, are perjurers.</P>
<P>17. These allegations are equally reprehensible, and equally without merit as those hurled at the Plaintiff at trial.</P>
<P>18. The present application arises as a result of the special costs award. The decision of this court in <CASEREF><SOC>Guchuru v. Smith</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 414</CITE></CASEREF>, holds that, in order to maintain a special costs award, the entirety of the lawyer's file must be produced. The court says, in that decision, that a litigant can avoid the obvious problems arising from that waiver of privilege by waiting until all appeal rights have been exhausted before revealing his/her file.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Guchuru v. Smith</SOC><CITE>2014 BCCA 414</CITE><PARANUM>104 and 114</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>19. Ironically, the Appellants have now seized upon certain contents of that file to bring these very serious allegations.</P>
<P>20. The trial was lengthy. It occupied 16 days. The court heard evidence from Mr. Wright and Mr. Long, from Mr. Darch, from Mark Andrews, Q.C., from Mr. Gabrielson, also of Faskens, and from David Anderson, another lawyer. All of them corroborated Mr. Long, while the evidence provided by Paul Royce, an accountant, called by Mr. Wright, was found to dove tail with that of Mr. Darch. It was not inconsistent with that of Mr. Long.</P>
<P>21. It must also be remembered that both Mr. Darch and Mr. Wright, and Mr. Darch and Mr. Long, had complicated relationship histories of their own.</P>
<P>22. Mr. Long and Mr. Wright were lifelong friends until an ugly falling out in 2011. Mr. Darch and Mr. Wright had been long time business partners and were so at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation. They also had an ugly falling out, which ended in vituperative litigation. Mr. Wright accused Mr. Darch of fraud. Obviously, all of that was well known to Mr. Wright.</P>
<P>23. Mr. Darch and Mr. Long also had been in business together, and like Mr. Darch and Mr. Wright, had been friends. They too had parted ways. Unlike Mr. Wright, the two had not sued each other, but they terminated their relationship in 2014, a year prior to trial, and had not spoken since. All of that was also known to Mr. Wright.</P>
<P>24. That being the case, when advised in June 2013 by Mr. Long's Trial Brief, upon being advised again, in March 2015 by Mr. Long's second Trial Brief, followed by the providing of a Will Say statement, of the fact that Mr. Darch would be a witness for the Plaintiff, the remarkable fact is that neither Mr. Wright or his counsel contacted Mr. Darch or even, attempted to do so to discuss what evidence he would give. That remarkable fact is only exceeded by the even more remarkable assertion, crucial on this application, that Mr. Wright could not have discovered, prior to trial, what Mr. Darch's evidence was, what evidence he had to give and what his involvement was,.</P>
<P>25. The Appellants' version of the facts and their attack on Mr. Darch overstate the true facts. The Appellants rely on what they say are two essential facts. (para 33, para 19).
<QUOTE><P>33. In addition to the significant assistance provided Darch as outlined above, a number of emails in the plaintiff's solicitors' file establish that Darch made several direct, and indirect payments through his company Western Investments Ltd., towards the plaintiff's legal accounts.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Affidavit of Tiffany Hambrook, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;, pp. 4&ndash;12</P1>
<QUOTE><P>19. The solicitors' file is replete with evidence that Darch and the plaintiff discussed the litigation in detail orally and by way of correspondence over at least the period of January 2012 to February 2013. We have reviewed a portion of that evidence below, which can be described as nothing less than remarkable given the testimony of Darch and the plaintiff.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appellants' Memorandum of Argument, paras. 33 and 19</P1></P>
<P>26. The first is untrue, the latter is wildly overstated.</P>
<P>27. As to the latter, in the first place, the documents produced do not disclose that Mr. Darch and the Plaintiff discussed the litigation in detail both orally and by way of correspondence as the Appellants allege. In the second place, such correspondence as there was, does not disclose a continuous involvement of Mr. Darch in the litigation from June 2012 to February 2013. That is a total mischaracterization of the evidence.</P>
<P>28. In fact, there were four distinct periods of involvement on the part of Mr. Darch: June 2012, a couple of days in December 2012, and two emails from Mr. Darch to Mr. Long's lawyers in February 2013. In addition, of course, Mr. Darch was involved in preparing for trial in March 2015, two years after the last of those events.</P>
<P>29. In so far as financial assistance is concerned, the allegations that Mr. Darch paid legal accounts are simply untrue. The basic facts are that Mr. Long, as was well known to Mr. Wright, worked for Mr. Darch in Bangkok. He earned upwards of $10,000 per month, plus a living allowance. As a matter of convenience to Mr. Long, those funds were deposited into and disbursed from a bank account in the name of Western Investments Ltd., Mr. Darch's company.</P>
<P>30. Payments went from that account to organizations and institutions, to relatives, and, on occasion, to Mr. Long's lawyers. Mr. Long was charged with the bank fees for this arrangement which were, after all, made for his convenience. All of the money provided to Clark Wilson LLP, whether by transfer or by cheque, delivered by Mr. Darch, was Mr. Long's money. Neither Mr. Darch, nor Mr. Darch acting through any of his companies provided any financial assistance at all to Mr. Long. The allegation is simply untrue.</P>
<P>31. The other allegation, that of providing assistance, is more nebulous. Certainly Mr. Darch provided information and expressed his views of how Mr. Wright might conduct the litigation. If the providing of information is the providing of &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; in the sense that indicates a disqualifying bias, then virtually every non-party witness is guilty.</P>
<P>32. At trial, Mr. Darch said with respect to the providing of information the following:
<QUOTE><P>A: I have not been assisting Mr. Long in the litigation. I gave him this information at the time, that if he was being denied something which he claimed was justly his, then it would be inappropriate of me not to tell him where he might find the proof that he needs.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Appellants' Memorandum, pg. 6</P1></P>
<P>33. It is necessary to turn to the evidence of what the Appellants say was evidence of the providing of assistance in a disqualifying way with precision and care, and not with a generalized gloss. One must closely examine the evidence in support of each accusation:
<P1>(a) Mr. Darch sent a lengthy email on June 17, 2012, to Mr. Long. Mr. Long did not share that memo with his lawyers until February of 2013. There is no indication that they discussed it, or that Mr. Darch knew what Mr. Long had done with the email and he swears he did not;</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Darch met with Mr. Long's lawyers on June 18, 2012, to discuss his evidence;</P1>
<P1>(c) Mr. Darch sent emails on June 28, 2012, surrounding his meetings with the Andersons, who had requested him to meet to discuss the litigation;</P1>
<P1>(d) On June 30, 2012, Mr. Darch sent an email regarding a visit he had made to Faskens to review the royalty files in which Faskens had been involved; and</P1>
<P1>(e) He provided certain source document emails to Long's lawyers, which were disclosed in long's List of Documents.</P1></P>
<P>34. Mr. Darch gave evidence that his involvement in the above matters occurred before the pleadings commenced. His timing may have been off. The proceedings were commenced in April, not June. In his affidavit, Mr. Darch asserts that he still has a recollection of discussing the case prior to the proceedings with Long, as he testified he had at trial. With this said, however, even if his recollection is incorrect, and he did not have any discussions prior to April, this was a mistake on his part, not a knowing lie made with the intention to mislead the court.</P>
<P>35. At paragraph 4 of the Appellants' Memorandum of Argument, it is contended that it was Mr. Darch's testimony at trial that he &ldquo;only discussed the litigation with the plaintiff in early 2012, prior to the commencement of the litigation&rdquo;. This was absolutely not so.</P>
<P>36. A careful analysis of the cross examination of Mr. Darch shows that he was asked very specific questions and provided truthful answers to same. Specifically, he was asked if he had ever &ldquo;discussed&rdquo; the legal proceeding with Mr. Long, to which he advised that he had. When asked about when these discussions took place, he advised that they were in the early part of 2012. It was then put to him if he had discussed the matter with Long before he initiated the proceedings, with which Mr. Darch agreed. No further questions were asked. At no time did Mr. Darch state or suggest that this was the only time he had talked to Mr. Long about this litigation.</P>
<P>37. Of the above list of events occurring in June, 2012, all but the email of June 17 were disclosed by Mr. Darch in his evidence at trial:
<ITEM><P>Mr. Darch discussed the case with Mr. Long (pg. 580);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Mr. Darch met with the lawyers (pg. 580);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Mr. Darch met with the Andersons (pg. 581);</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>Mr. Darch provided documents, being emails to the lawyers, (pg. 580 and 581).</P></ITEM></P>
<P>38. These facts were not probed in cross-examination. They were not in fact even followed up on, but they were, nonetheless, revealed. The contents of the lawyer's file, and the emails relied on by the Appellants, while fleshing things out somewhat, all, with the exception of the email of June 17<SUP>th</SUP> reflect events specifically disclosed at the trial and do not constitute fresh evidence at all. The fact they were virtually ignored in cross-examination does not make them so.</P>
<P>39. Moreover, none of the documents, again with the exception of the email of June 17, indicates that Mr. Darch was particularly involved with Mr. Long and the litigation. What they do show is an interchange of information between the lawyers and Mr. Darch, much like one would expect from any witness with contemporaneous knowledge of the events. The only matter, therefore, of which the Appellants complain in June and which was not specifically and actually known by them, is the email of June 17.</P>
<P>40. That email does not show that Mr. Darch discussed the case with Mr. Long. The email was never discussed between the two men, and nor does it seem to have had much significance to Mr. Long. He did not even forward it to his lawyers until February of 2013. Moreover, it is not the contents of the email going to the merits which lead the Appellants to say Mr. Darch committed perjury.</P>
<P>41. The contents concerning the merits are consistent with Mr. Darch's evidence, and contain certain relevant assertions with respect to their truth. It also contains Mr. Darch's view of the timing of the commencement of proceedings.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Tiffany Hambrook, Exhibit B, pg. 21</P1></P>
<P>42. Mr. Darch swears, in paras. 24 through 26 of his affidavit, that his experience with Mr. Wright suggested he would both lie and misconduct himself in the litigation. In order to ensure the truth came out, he felt he had to pass on both his knowledge, and to warn Mr. Long as to how Mr. Wright would conduct himself. He predicted, accurately. Mr. Wright lied numerous times at the trial, made reprehensible allegations, and employed such tactics as not listing relevant documents until after his examination for discovery.</P>
<P>43. With respect to paragraph 21(a) of the Memorandum, as set out in Mr. Darch's affidavit, the Appellants completely misquote and misconstrue the contents of the email. At no time does Mr. Darch suggest that he is to educate the plaintiff's lawyers, and, instead, he states that it will be up to Mr. Long to educate his own lawyers on matters.</P>
<P>44. Similarly, paragraph 21(h) of the Memorandum is a complete misrepresentation of the intent of the statement in that paragraph of the email. Mr. Darch is not suggesting that he will be the key to winning the case. To the contrary, he is stating that Mr. Long will have to prove the case absent his testimony and, given his previous history with Mr. Wright and the anticipated attacks on his motive at trial, that he will only be able to corroborate the evidence in place.</P>
<P>45. It is in essence the fact of the email that is claimed to be perjury with respect to the denial that Mr. Darch provided assistance. Mr. Darch maintained, both at trial, and still maintains, that as that term was understood by him, he did not in fact provide assistance. It is that assertion which is said to constitute perjury. It does not. Both Mr. Darch and Mr. Long have testified that they had forgotten about the email by the time of trial. They had not prepared for trial on the issue of the involvement of Mr. Darch in trial preparation, or their communications with each other. The June 2012 events had taken place almost three years prior to trial. Not surprisingly, their actual preparation had focused on the events, not their dealings inter se.</P>
<P>46. Moreover, while potentially inaccurate on timing, Mr. Darch did say he had discussed the lawsuit with Mr. Long prior to litigation commencing, which may, instead, have been in June of 2012. Not only is it very likely that Mr. Darch did discuss the litigation with Mr. Long prior to April 2012, but he was not asked if he had communicated further with Long about it. He was not asked about follow up discussions, the content of those discussions, or whether he had sent Mr. Long any emails. Once again, the evidence he gave was neither probed, nor tested, nor even expanded upon in cross-examination.</P>
<P>47. The failure to mention the sending of a forgotten email when not specifically asked, all the while admitting that he had discussed the case with Mr. Long, does not even approximate the serious conduct which would support an accusation of perjury. It must also be remembered that the denial of any friendship was, at the time of trial, also true. Mr. Darch and Mr. Long may have been associates and business friends in 2012, but they were no longer so by trial. They had not even seen each other for a year.</P>
<P>48. In so far as Mr. Long is concerned, at trial he denied any discussions with Mr. Darch. That was inconsistent with Mr. Darch's evidence. That provided an ample opportunity for Mr. Wright to probe that inconsistency. The argument that Mr. Long gave a false answer in that regard does not arise from a review of the file and is not fresh evidence&mdash;the contradiction and the error in his evidence were not only known, but Mr. Wright failed to explore and exploit that contradiction in cross.</P>
<P>49. There was no further contact from Mr. Darch after June 2012 for another 5 <TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC> months. In December 2012, there was an exchange of emails between Clark Wilson and Darch and a review of some documents by Darch. That occurred over the period of a day or two. Whether it is perjury not to reveal that specific exchange of emails without actually being asked, again, goes to whether those events should have been recalled at all, whether they constitute assistance in some sort of disqualifying way, or could not have been known to Mr. Wright.</P>
<P>50. Frankly, it must be expected that counsel will provide documents from a List of Documents to contemporaneous witnesses and seek their comments. All lawyers do that, and all witnesses invariably cooperate. Nothing sinister arises out of such conduct on the part of a cooperating witness. If that is seen as a form of disqualifying assistance, than virtually all third party witnesses are suspect.</P>
<P>51. The same can be said of the two emails in February 2013. The first was a result of a request from counsel on a matter on which Mr. Darch was knowledgeable, the second consisted of delineating areas in which Mr. Darch felt he was likely to be attacked by Mr. Wright.</P>
<P>52. Again the question comes down to determining whether that constitutes the providing of assistance. Whatever that may actually mean (absent financial assistance) Mr. Wright was a very experienced litigant, represented by experienced and competent counsel. He cannot seriously contend that he took the denial that Mr. Darch had provided assistance to mean he had not discussed documents and evidence with Long's counsel. He cannot deny that that activity in fact is to be expected of every witness. The Appellants cannot seriously contend that discussing documents and evidence with counsel who is calling a witness, constitutes the providing of &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; so as to render perjurous a denial of doing so.</P>
<P>53. Mr. Darch swears that he did not consider that conduct to be providing assistance. Given that it would be normal to discuss evidence and documents, if the Appellants wished that term to be interpreted as denying normal and expected conduct. It was incumbent upon them to specifically put those propositions and narrow that term in cross-examination.</P>
<P>54. Mr. Darch testified:
<QUOTE><P>The Witness: Then my response will be to this, My Lord, absolutely I did not hire Mr. Long for any purpose of pursuing any claim against Mr. Wright. That is absolutely not in my interest. I have no interest who wins, friendship-wise, business-wise, any other reason. So whatever you may be trying to suggest over and over again is simply not true.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>55. That evidence was true. Mr. Darch had no interest in the litigation. By the time of trial he had no friendship with Mr. Long or Mr. Wright. He was a reluctant witness, as confirmed on several occasions.</P>
<P>56. With respect to Mr. Darch's reluctance to act as a witness, the Appellants fail to reference the communications in which this fact was relayed. On June 18, 2012, Mr. Long spoke of Mr. Darch, stating: &ldquo;He will also be a very advantageous, if somewhat reluctant, witness should we go to court.&rdquo; Mr. Darch's reluctance was again relayed in his March 2015 communications with legal counsel wherein he requested a &ldquo;summon to appear as a witness&rdquo; and stated he was certain that Mr. Wright's lawyer would try to sabotage him and allege he was acting out of revenge. In this exchange, he confirmed that he had &ldquo;no vested interest in whoever wins the case&rdquo;. Of note, although disclosed to them, the Appellants did not include this email exchange in the affidavit of Tiffany Hambrook.</P>
<P>57. In addition, of all the emails, only the June 17 email, and the brief exchanges of emails in December and February constituted events which were not specifically disclosed in Mr. Darch's evidence at trial.</P>
<P>58. It is perhaps telling that the Appellants have been somewhat selective even now in their production from counsels' file.</P>
<P>59. The Appellants are hard pressed to say that they could not have known of the events reflected in those emails or could not have discovered them with due diligence, because they never asked. The Appellants are equally hard pressed to say they honestly believed that when Mr. Darch said he was not providing assistance, particularly as that answer was qualified, it is perjury if he had, in fact, discussed documents and his evidence with counsel.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">III. <UNDER>The Law</UNDER></TI>
<P>60. While the test for introducing fresh evidence is tailored somewhat in a distinctive way in cases in which it is alleged the fresh evidence discloses that the judgment was obtained by fraud or perjury, the starting point of any fresh analysis is <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Palmer</SOC></CASEREF>, (citation).</P>
<P>61. At page 775, the court lays down four principles:
<QUOTE><P>(1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see <CASEREF><SOC>McMartin v. the Queen</SOC></CASEREF></P>
<P>(2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</P>
<P>(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and</P>
<P>(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ascent Developments Corp. v. Stonehenge Projects Inc.</SOC><CITE>2016 BCCA 287</CITE></CASEREF></P1>
<P1>See also <CASEREF><SOC>HMTQ v. N.L.P</SOC><CITE>2013 ONCA 773</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>62. Here, it is claimed, the fresh evidence whose introduction is sought will show that certain evidence given at trial was fraudulent in that it was perjured testimony. It is alleged that the fresh evidence will show that the witness Mr. Darch perjured himself when he testified:
<P1>(a) He had not provided assistance to the Plaintiff;</P1>
<P1>(b) He had no bias as between the Plaintiff and the Defendant; and</P1>
<P1>(c) He had no interest in the outcome of the litigation.</P1></P>
<P>63. It is also claimed that the Plaintiff perjured himself when he testified he had not discussed the case with Mr. Darch.</P>
<P>64. Perjury is an extremely serious allegation. It has three elements&mdash;falsity, knowledge and intent. In order to establish perjury the evidence must establish not only that the evidence was false. It must also be established that the witness knew that the evidence was false, and, further, that that knowingly false evidence was given in order to mislead the court.</P>
<P>65. The key elements are the knowledge that the evidence is false and the intent to mislead. In <EM>Granitile</EM>, the court acknowledged that a determination that certain evidence or that a certain witness lacks credibility is not the same as finding the evidence was perjured. The court acknowledged that false or untrue evidence might be given as a result of:
<QUOTE><P>[465] I should also note that the finding that perjury was not present does not detract from the fact that Nicholas Pirruccio was not accurate, honest or complete in what he told the Court. There were things he should have said that he did not. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that: &ldquo;it is beyond debate that false testimony provided as a result of confusion, mistake, faulty memory, carelessness, misunderstanding, mistaken conclusions, unjustified inferences testifies to negligently, or even recklessness does not satisfy the &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; element required for a finding of perjury....</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>66. Such evidence might impair a witnesses' credibility, but not amount to perjury. Perjury in the civil context is defined identically to the definition contained in section 310 of the Criminal Code.
<QUOTE><P>131 (1) Subject to subsection (3), every one commits perjury who, with intent to mislead, makes before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be made before him a false statement under oath or solemn affirmation, by affidavit, solemn declaration or deposition or orally, knowing that the statement is false.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>67. Here, it is said that the perjured evidence is not with respect to an occurrence or an event at issue in the proceedings, such as whether some transaction occurred, or whether some document was signed, or whether some agreement was made. The perjury, it is said, would impact on the trial judge's assessment of credibility.</P>
<P>68. The degree to which that must be so, in order for the Appellants to succeed, will be discussed later. It is useful to set out now, however, the principles, factors and considerations that go into an assessment of credibility.</P>
<P>69. It is one of the most discretionary decisions made by a trial judge, which explains the reluctance of this Court to interfere in such findings. This Court, it is frequently said, does not have the opportunity of observing the witness. Credibility involves much more, however, than merely observing the witness. In an oft cited passage, adopted by this Court, in <CASEREF><SOC>Bradshaw v. Stenner</SOC><CITE>2010, BCSC 1398</CITE></CASEREF>, Madam Justice Dillon said as follows:
<QUOTE><P>[186] Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (<CASEREF><SOC>Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township)</SOC><YEAR>1919</YEAR><CITE>1919 CanLII 11</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>59 S.C.R. 452</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>50 D.L.R. 560</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>S.C.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (<CASEREF><SOC>Wallace v. Davis</SOC><CITE>[1926] 31 O.W.N. 202</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont.H.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>; <CASEREF><SOC>Faryna v.

Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (<EM>Farnya</EM> at para. 356)</P></QUOTE>

<P>70. Moreover, the court is entitled to accept some or all of a witnesses' testimony and a finding that certain aspects of a witnesses' testimony are not credible does not taint the entirety of his or her evidence. A judge is entitled to accept some, all, or none of a witnesses' testimony, even if the judge makes adverse findings of credibility on some particular aspect of that evidence.

<P>71. That inquiry is even more difficult at the level of this Court, when the Court must determine whether the fresh evidence could reasonably have been expected to have affected the credibility assessment of the actual trier of fact.

<P>72. In cases where fresh evidence is sought to be introduced, to demonstrate fraud or perjury, the law tries to balance two competing principles&mdash;finality and the integrity of the process. There is, as the court says in <EM>Granitile</EM>, a &ldquo;tension in the core values of our legal system. There is a need to balance the desire for finality against the requirement that the court protect the integrity of its processes.&rdquo;</P>
<P>73. As the court says, the key is to find the right balance.
<P1><EM>Granitile</EM>, para. 2</P1>
<P1>See also <CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Hummel</SOC><CITE>2003 YKCA 4</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>74. There are slight differences that have emerged in the implementation of the test, but all the authorities agree that as a starting point, the alleged perjury must be proved on a balance of probabilities, with clear and cogent evidence. The more serious the alleged fraud, the clearer and more cogent the evidence must be. (<EM>Granitile</EM>, paras. 283&ndash;289).</P>
<P>75. All of this has led to a restatement of the Palmer test in cases of fraud or perjury, although the fundamental principles of Palmer form the substratum of those requirements. In <CASEREF><SOC>International Corona Resources Ltd. v. LAC Minerals Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1988 CanLII 4534</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Mr. Justice Osbourne laid down a number of propositions. Those which are relevant to the case at bar are as follows:
<QUOTE><P>(1)The fraud alleged must be proved on a reasonable balance of probability. The more serious the fraud alleged, the more cogent the evidence going to establish it will have to be to meet the civil onus of proof. The reasonable balance of probability is not an inflexible standard of proof.</P>
<P>(2) The proved fraud must be material, that is, it must go to the foundation of the case.</P>
<P>(3) The evidence of fraud must not have been known at the time of trial to the party seeking to rely upon it on a motion to set aside a trial judgment.</P>
<P>(4) The unsuccessful trial party is exposed to a test of due or reasonable diligence. This is clear from cases such as, <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Pier</SOC></CASEREF>, supra; <CASEREF><SOC>Johnston v. Barkley</SOC></CASEREF>, supra, and <CASEREF><SOC>Industrial Development Bank v. Bertolo</SOC></CASEREF>, supra. In my view, the onus is on the moving party to establish due diligence....</P>
<P>(5) If the fraud alleged is that of a non-party, and if the successful party at trial is not connected with the fraud alleged, the tests to which I have referred must be more stringent than for the fraud of a party....</P>
<P>(6) The test imposed upon the unsuccessful trial party to obtain relevant evidence&mdash;that is, evidence going to establish fraud&mdash;with due diligence, is objective. The questions to be asked are: what did the moving party know, and what ought the moving party to have known?....</P>
<P>&ldquo;(9) At the end of the day, the central question to be answered is as stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Wentworth v. Rogers (No. 5)</SOC></CASEREF>, supra, at p. 538:</P>
<P>... it must be shown, by the party asserting that a judgment was procured by fraud, that there has been a new discovery of something material, in the sense that fresh facts have been found which, by themselves or in combination with previously known facts, would provide a reason for setting aside the judgment..</P></QUOTE>
<P1>See also <CASEREF><SOC>Coughlin v. Kuntz</SOC><CITE>1997 CanLII 2995</CITE><COURTJUR>BC SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Rodenkirchen v. Peters</SOC><CITE>2006 BCSC 1021</CITE></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>76. Such differences as have arisen in the authorities as to the test to be applied fall into two areas&mdash;the requirement of due diligence, and the determination of the degree of impact the fresh evidence must have on the result. <EM>Corona</EM> clearly postulates a requirement that the evidence could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence, a requirement endorsed by Mr. Justice Cowan in the decision in Coughlin (paras. 32 to 36).</P>
<P>77. This court has held that applications such as these entail two distinct steps. Although in practical terms, they seem to merge, the proper process involves, first, determining whether the decision should be reconsidered at all, and secondly, whether it should be set aside.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Temple Consulting Group Ltd. v. Abakhan</SOC><CITE>2013 BCCA 119</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>78. The purpose of the due diligence requirement, which is considered as part of the first step, is to give weight to the value of finality in the balancing of the competing core values.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Nyoni</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 106</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>79. <EM>Corona</EM> postulates that the Appellants are &ldquo;exposed to a test of reasonable diligence&rdquo;. Tactical decisions, failure to call a witness, deliberate choices made, will not meet the standard. As was pointed out in <EM>Caughlin</EM>, however, the requirement of due diligence may have to be tempered, or at least considered in light of the fact that it is fraud of which the complaint is being made.</P>
<P>80. A truly clever fraudster, who does not even raise suspicion, It is said, surely cannot be allowed to retain the fruits of a judgment fraudulently obtained. However, even if fraud is alleged, the requirement of the demonstration of due diligence is essential to &ldquo;ensure finality and order, values essential to the integrity of the criminal process.&rdquo;
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>R. v. Nyoni</SOC><CITE>2017 BCCA 106</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>81. <EM>Granitile</EM> addresses the issue at some length, and while some of its reasoning, perhaps, seems a little fine (para. 307) after a careful analysis, it rests its decision on the proposition that, in cases involving fraud, the test of due diligence is an objective one&mdash;&ldquo;what did the moving party know, and what ought the moving party to have known.&rdquo;
<P1><EM>Granitile</EM>, para. 108</P1></P>
<P>82. The Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Albert v. Politano</SOC><CITE>2013 BCCA 194</CITE></CASEREF>, expresses the test in similar terms.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Albert v. Politano</SOC><CITE>2013 BCCA 194</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>83. The presence of fraud raises similar difficulties in assessing the degree of impact on the final result. The allegations must meet in order to engage the court's juris diction. The starting point of the analysis is, once again, <EM>Corona</EM>, which holds that the inquiry must be with regard to a material matter, and goes on to say:
<QUOTE><P>It seems to me the word &ldquo;material&rdquo; means that which goes to the foundation of the decision or which goes to the crux of a central issue before the court. &ldquo;Material&rdquo; obviously means something different from and, in this context, more than &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;; it means more than evidence which would be an appropriate topic for cross-examination on credibility, but collateral in the sense of being divorced from any of the main issues in the case in a trial</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>84. <EM>Granitile</EM> holds that while the fraud must be material, it is not necessary that there be a finding that it is &ldquo;determinative of the decision being attacked&rdquo;.
<P1><EM>Granitile</EM>, para. 315</P1></P>
<P>85. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in <CASEREF><SOC>100 Main Street East Ltd. v. Sakas</SOC><CITE>1975 CanLII 381</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, speaks, once again, of the need of balancing the needs of certainty and finality with the need to protect the integrity of the system, and puts the proposition this way:
<QUOTE><P>These authorities make it clear that the new evidence of fraud must relate to the &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; of the decision or be &ldquo;material&rdquo; to the claim or defence, but need not necessarily amount to a &ldquo;determining factor in the result&rdquo;. Duff, J., in a dissenting opinion in <CASEREF><SOC>MacDonald v. Pier</SOC><CITE>1922 CanLII 29</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[1923] S.C.R. 107</CITE><PAGENUM>at pp. 120-1</PAGENUM><CORRELAT><CITE>[1923] 1 D.L.R. 670</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> at pp. 680-1, [1923] 1 W.W.R. 376, in discussing this principle, stated:</P>
<P>... there is jurisdiction in the court to entertain an action to set aside a judgment on the ground that it has been obtained through perjury. The principle I conceive to be this; such jurisdiction exists but in the exercise of it the court will not permit its process to be made use of and will exert the utmost care and caution to prevent its process being used for the purpose of obtaining a retrial of an issue already determined, of an issue which transivit in rem judicatam under the guise of impugning a judgment as procured by fraud. Therefore the perjury must be in a material matter and therefore it must be established by evidence not known to the parties at the time of the former trial.</P>
<P>The process appears to be one of balancing the need for the Courts to protect the integrity of their process against fraudulent practices before the Court, on the one hand, against the practical requirement of certainty and finality in litigation on the other. The latter principle is expressed by Lord Justice James in <CASEREF><SOC>Flower v. Lloyd</SOC><YEAR>1878</YEAR><CITE>10 Ch. D. 327</CITE><PAGENUM>at pp. 333-4</PAGENUM></CASEREF>: ...</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>86. Perhaps the most practical statement is that contained in the Alberta Court of Appeal judgment of <CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hill</SOC></CASEREF>. The court there was considering the case of a chambers judge who had indicated that the fresh evidence in question was required to be &ldquo;practically conclusive&rdquo; before the judgment could be set aside, and concluded that the various postulations of the test were merely different ways of saying the same thing.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Hill v. Hill</SOC><CITE>2016 ABCA 49</CITE><PARANUM>55 and 56</PARANUM></CASEREF></P1></P>
<P>87. Applying that test to an issue of credibility, however, involves weighing the perjured evidence within the multi-faceted elements that go into a trial judge's assessment of a witnesses' credibility. The question is, considering the totality of the evidence at the trial, whether the evidence in question could inpune the offending witnesses' testimony to the extent of reasonably affecting the outcome of the trial.

<QUOTE><P>[21] The admissibility of the fresh evidence turns on whether that evidence, considered with the rest of the evidence adduced at trial, could be expected to have affected the result or, more specifically, could be expected to have affected the trial judge's assessment of Mr. Narine's credibility: see <CASEREF><SOC>Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters v.

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">IV. <UNDER>Application of the Law to the Facts</UNDER></TI>
<P>89. The above discussion establishes that the Appellants must:
<P1>(a) Establish the complained of evidence was perjured, with clear and compelling evidence;</P1>
<P1>(b) Establish that they exercised due diligence with respect to the evidence now relied on to establish the perjury, as that concept is applied in cases of fraud; and</P1>
<P1>(c) Demonstrate that the evidence would have had a material and substantive impact on the judge's assessment, both of the credibility of Mr. Darch, and on the result of the trial.</P1></P>
<P>90. The Appellants cannot do any of those three things.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V">V. <UNDER>Was There Perjury?</UNDER></TI>
<P>91. The first element that must be established, with cogent and compelling evidence, is that there was perjury in the first place. Perjury is false evidence, knowingly given, with the intent to mislead. In a broad brush way, the allegation is that the Learned Trial Judge found Mr. Darch to be an unbiased witness, not interested by friendship or financial interests, and that he was, therefore, a credible witness.</P>
<P>92. It must be remembered, first of all, that the allegations of perjury do not go to the substance of Mr. Darch's evidence on the merits, but are restricted to the assessment of his credibility.</P>
<P>93. In the second place, with the exception of the allegation of providing financial assistance, the alleged perjury is not as to some specific, concrete and provable fact: did you say this to the police?; did you ever use a different name?; were you ever convicted of this offence?; etc. The allegation of perjury is as to a more nebulous concept, both requiring clarification and agreement on a definition. Did you provide &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;?; are you &ldquo;biased&rdquo;?</P>
<P>94. The allegation that financial assistance was provided is simply untrue. An explanation has been provided for the fact that Clark Wilson's ledgers record payments received on behalf of Mr. Long from Mr. Darch's company or, in some cases, from Mr. Darch.</P>
<P>95. The facts, however, are that Mr. Long resided in Bangkok, he had no readily accessible bank account, he was credited with funds he had earned under his employment contract, and rather than being paid directly to him, those funds were distributed on his behalf. They were distributed to relatives, and to other parties, including Clark Wilson.</P>
<P>96. The explanation of Mr. Darch and Mr. Long is corroborated by documents. An email of June 7, 2013, refers to Mr. Darch making an advance if only a particular payment had been received. Other documents show that the funds were sent to various locations, not just sent to Clark Wilson to provide dollars to run the lawsuit. The evidence of Mr. Long and Mr. Darch is fully corroborated by those documents. The denial of providing financial assistance was not false, let alone knowingly false, or made with an intention to mislead.
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Mr. Darch, Exhibit C, pg. 7</P1></P>
<P>97. Whether Mr. Darch provided assistance in other ways, is far more nebulous a question. Without exploring, in cross-examination the particulars of what was meant by &ldquo;providing assistance&rdquo; it is impossible for the Appellants to present cogent and compelling evidence that the denial was perjury. To the extent that there was an example given in cross, it focused on financial assistance&mdash;arranging for a job so that Mr. Long would funds to carry on the lawsuit. In terms of Mr. Darch's understanding of the providing of assistance, in his affidavit, Mr. Darch says as follows:
<QUOTE><P>33. I also stand by my assertion that I provided no assistance to Mr. Long in this litigation. I considered assistance, when I was asked that question, to be something concrete, such as the arranging for counsel, a contribution to legal fees, or, as was put to me in cross-examination, creating a job for Mr. Long so that he would have the wherewithal to fund this litigation.</P>
<P>34. I did not consider it providing assistance to Mr. Long to be a witness and, as a witness, to advise both he and his lawyers as to what my evidence was and as to what documents I was aware of, as a witness, which would be relevant to the litigation. In my view, that is the obligation of every witness, and I did not, and do not view that as providing assistance to Mr. Long in the litigation, but rather as doing my duty. I alluded to that view in my evidence at trial.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Affidavit #1 of Mr. Darch, paras. 33 and 34</P1></P>
<P>98. At trial, on the question of the meaning of the providing of assistance, Mr. Darch said the following:
<QUOTE><P>A: I have not been assisting Mr. Long in the litigation. I gave him this information at the time, that if he was being denied something which he claimed was justly his, then it would be inappropriate of me not to tell him where he might find the proof that he needs.</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Memorandum, pg. 6</P1></P>
<P>99. Mr. Darch maintained, both then and now, that he did not provide assistance as he understood it. Instead, he performed his duty, as someone who was asked to be a witness should do. Moreover, he frankly testified, at trial, and the Appellants were well aware, that he gave &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; in the very sense about which it is now argued he lied. Mr. Darch testified:
<P1>(a) He had discussed the case with Mr. Long;</P1>
<P1>(b) He had met with Mr. Long's lawyers;</P1>
<P1>(c) He had provided documents to those lawyers; and</P1>
<P1>(d) He had met with the Andersons and discussed the merits of the case with them.</P1></P>
<P>100. His general statement, therefore, that he had not provided assistance, must be assessed in light of the other evidence he provided at trial, and perjury cannot be established by producing hitherto privileged emails which simply show that he engaged in the very activities he testified he engaged in at trial, but which give more particulars of that evidence. That is a total non sequitur, particularly as his answers were not probed at all on cross-examination.</P>
<P>101. As in <CASEREF><SOC>Liedtke-Thompson v. Gignac</SOC><CITE>2014 YKCA 10</CITE></CASEREF>, the first question is was there perjury at all? One cannot point to emails showing that Mr. Darch met with lawyers, provided information to lawyers, provided documents to lawyers, met with witnesses, and discussed the matter with Mr. Long as being evidence of perjury when Mr. Darch had already said he did all of those things in his evidence.</P>
<P>102. In so far as Mr. Long is concerned, the complaint is that Mr. Long testified at trial that he did not discuss the matter with Mr. Darch. However, the trial judge was aware, from the cross-examination, of the contradiction between Mr. Long's evidence and Mr. Darch's evidence on that score and to the extent that that affected Mr. Long's credibility, it must have been included in the trial judge's assessment of the case.</P>
<P>103. Moreover, there is no evidence at all to suggest anything other than that Long's memory was faded. Indeed, in one of his responses, he seemed to confirm that he had received some advice from Mr. Darch! That apparent contradiction in his own evidence, together with the contradiction with Mr. Darch's evidence, was not explored on cross-examination, but it was a conflict which was part of the evidence at trial weighed by the trial judge and cannot come as a surprise to anyone.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="VI">VI. <UNDER>Due Diligence</UNDER></TI>
<P>104. All of the above facts impact not only the question of whether there was perjury, but impact the issue of due diligence. One need not go so far as the postulation of the test in <EM>Corona</EM> to say that there was none. Assuming the test is as postulated in <EM>Granitile</EM>, an objective test that the Appellants either knew or ought to have known of the evidence, the Appellants still fail.</P>
<P>105. The Appellants knew, and the evidence at trial included, so the Learned Trial Judge also knew:
<P1>(a) There had been vituperative litigation between Mr. Wright and Mr. Darch;</P1>
<P1>(b) Mr. Darch and Mr. Long were business partners and friends for a period of time;</P1>
<P1>(c) Mr. Darch had met with Mr. Long's lawyers;</P1>
<P1>(d) Mr. Darch had provided documents to Mr. Long's lawyers;</P1>
<P1>(e) Mr. Darch had met with the Andersons; and</P1>
<P1>(f) Mr. Darch had had discussions with Mr. Long about the litigation.</P1></P>
<P>106. The Appellants must also be taken to have known what a cooperating witness normally does. Such a witness does meet with lawyers, he does produce documents to those lawyers, he does discuss the case with the party and counsel on whose behalf he is being called. It is inevitable that he identifies, in an adversarial process, to some extent, with the party calling him as a witness. That is neither sinister nor evidence of bias.</P>
<P>107. If it is the position of the Respondent that if the emails do in fact disclose conduct which the Court considers over and above what would normally be expected from a cooperating witness, then the Appellants certainly knew enough of the facts to press the points vigorously on cross-examination, to see what could be elicited. The cross-examination on the issue of providing assistance was somewhat tepid, but it is equally telling that there was no effort at all made to interview Mr. Darch prior to trial.</P>
<P>108. There is no property in a witness. Indeed, the <EM>Supreme Court Rules</EM> and the necessity of filing Trial Briefs are to identify witnesses to the other side precisely so that the evidence they might give can be canvassed with one's own client, and so one can contact the witness to ascertain what it is they might say.</P>
<P>109. The Appellants were told, three times, that Mr. Darch was going to be called as a witness. That requirement is imposed in the <EM>Rules</EM> to get rid of ambush, precisely so that the witness <UNDER>can</UNDER> be contacted and his evidence discussed. There was ample opportunity, both prior to trial, and on cross-examination, to launch an inquiry as to whether there was any bias on the part of Mr. Darch, and enough facts were known, or ought to have been known, to place an onus upon the Appellants to pursue the issue more thoroughly than they did.</P>
<P>110. It is interesting to determine what inference can be drawn from Mr. Wright's failure to contact Mr. Darch. It has been held that the failure of a lawyer to interview a potential witness is negligence.</P>
<P>111. The inference that competent and capable trial counsel was negligent ought not to be drawn. The proper inference to draw is that Mr. Wright made a deliberate decision not to have his lawyer contact Mr. Darch because he knew precisely what it was Mr. Darch would tell that lawyer, and he did not view contacting him as a fruitful exercise for his lawyer to engage in. As to bias arising from the relationships between Mr. Wright and Mr. Darch, the facts of that litigation were obviously known to Mr. Wright, but once again, they were not put to Mr. Darch on cross-examination.</P>
<P>112. The facts of the Darch/ Long relationship were also known and disclosed at trial as being a business and friendly relationship. However, as deposed to in the current affidavits, Mr. Darch and Mr. Long were no longer associates or friends by the time of tri al, and had not seen each other since 2014.</P>
<P>113. The Appellants cannot demonstrate, on the basis of any definition, that they have discharged the burden of due diligence.</P>
<P>114. The final question is the impact the evidence had on the assessment of credibility and the ultimate determination at trial.</P>
<P>115. This case did not turn upon Mr. Darch being unbiased and not having provided assistance to Mr. Long. The assessment of Mr. Darch's credibility did not turn solely upon the trial judge's determination of a lack of bias although, obviously, that was a factor in his determination. There are, at the end of the day, only two questions.</P>
<P>116. Had the trial judge known that Mr. Darch sent the emails in June, December and February, and undertaken the activities those emails disclose, would the trial judge's assessment of Mr. Darch's credibility be any different? Given that those activities being undertaken by Mr. Darch would not surprise the trial judge, as they are what any witness does, were testified to by Darch, and given that the contents of those emails, (in so far as they go to the merits), in fact bolster Mr. Darch's credibility, it is difficult to see how that knowledge would have caused the trial judge to reach an adverse conclusion as to credibility. That is particularly so given that Darch's evidence was consistent with the evidence of Mark Andrews, Q.C., Mr. Long, certain of the documents, what Mr. Wright had said to other people, and the probability that his evidence was correct, weighed against the other evidence.</P>
<P>117. <EM>A fortiori</EM>, the trial decision, which was not based solely upon the credibility of Mr. Darch, who was only a corroborating witness, but was based rather on an assessment, as required, of the totality of the evidence, it is impossible to conclude that had the emails now attached to the affidavit of Ms. Hambrook, been placed in evidence at the trial, the outcome of the trial would have differed in the slightest.</P>
<P>118. The application should be dismissed. Special costs should be awarded for these unfounded and scandalous assertions.</P>
<P>Dated this 19<SUP>th</SUP> day of December, 2017.</P>
