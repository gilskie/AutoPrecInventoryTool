<P>34. In the premises, the actions of MACUMBER against the plaintiff Ola were malicious, unconstitutional, and outrageous. The conduct of the defendant MACUMBER and other members of the WPS demonstrated a wonton and outrageous disregard for the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and in the manner in which the depredation of the plaintiffs' rights was conducted, justify an award of punitive and public law damages of sufficient magnitude to vindicate the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and to deter these defendants and others who would emulate their conduct.</P>

<P>3. Expressly as herein expressly stated, the defendants have no knowledge of the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Statement of Claim.</P>
<P>4. In further response to paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim, the defendant The City of Winnipeg (the &ldquo;City&rdquo;) is a municipal corporation continued pursuant to <EM>The City of Winnipeg Charter</EM> (the &ldquo;CWC&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. In further response to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Statement of Claim, at all times material hereto, the defendant Macumber was a member of the Winnipeg Police Service which was a department of the City established pursuant to a by-law enacted pursuant to the CWC (the &ldquo;WPS&rdquo;).</P>
<P>6. In answer to the Statement of Claim as a whole, the defendants say the facts are as follows:
<P1>a. At or about 11:09 p.m. on December 26, 2014, the WPS received an emergency call for service from the Clarion Hotel at 1445 Portage Avenue in the City of Winnipeg (the &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;). The WPS was advised that an intoxicated male was running in the hallway of the second floor of the hotel, banging on a number of doors of hotel rooms, trying to gain entry into the hotel rooms, being aggressive, yelling and scaring patrons of the hotel.</P1>
<P1>b. At or about 11:14 p.m. of the same night, the WPS received a further call from the hotel, saying the same male had now returned to his room which was 220, but was still being very loud.</P1>
<P1>c. The WPS dispatched several units to the hotel. The first officers who arrived at the hotel were Constables Macumber and Powell. They arrived at 11:15 p.m. They were soon joined by Constable De Groot and Street Supervisor Cote. These officers were advised by hotel staff that the occupants of room 220 had been ingesting alcohol and marijuana and the hotel wanted the occupants of room 220 removed from the hotel.</P1>
<P1>d. The officers attended at room 220. They could hear yelling and other loud noises from inside room 220. They knocked on the door and it was answered by the plaintiff Andrew Beaulieu, who immediately assumed an aggressive demeanour and fighting stance. The room smelled of marijuana and the officers could see evidence of extensive alcohol vise inside the room. They could also see what appeared to be one female adult, who was later identified as the plaintiff Ola Beaulieu and three minors, who were later identified as Cheyenne Mills and the the plaintiffs Kyra Beaulieu and Kyuss Beaulieu, inside the room.</P1>
<P1>e. The officers explained to the plaintiffs that they were there in response to complaints about noise and disruption and were permitted to enter the room to discuss the situation. During this discussion, the plaintiffs were aggressive, belligerent and loud.</P1>
<P1>f. During the course of the discussion between the officers and the plaintiffs, the plaintiff Kyra Beaulieu touched Constable Macumber on the shoulder with her cell phone so he told her not to touch him, removed the cell phone from her hand and placed it on the nearby bar in the room. He also took another nearby cell phone and placed it on the bar. g. During the course of the discussion between the officers and the plaintiffs, the plaintiff Kyra Beaulieu punched Constable Macumber on the lower left arm, causing his radio and holster to fall to the ground and shoved him in the chin with an open hand. In response, he told her not to push him and pushed her back with both hands. She fell backwards into the nearby desk. The plaintiff Ola Beaulieu then punched Constable Macumber in the right side of his face and in the right eye and in response, he punched her approximately three times in the face. The plaintiff Andrew Beaulieu then attacked Constable Macumber from behind but was subdued by the other officers in the room.</P1>
<P1>h. Both the plaintiff Andrew Beaulieu and the plaintiff Ola Beaulieu were handcuffed by the officers and arrested, the plaintiff Andrew Beaulieu for assaulting a police officer and causing a disturbance and the plaintiff Ola Beaulieu for assaulting a police officer. They were both advised of their right to counsel and told that anything they said could be used as evidence.</P1>
<P1>i. Subsequently, the plaintiff Kyra Beaulieu was arrested for assaulting a police officer and causing a disturbance. During her arrest, she told the officers arresting her that she had marijuana in her pocket. She was charged with possession of marijuana. She was advised of her right to counsel and told that anything she said could be used as evidence.</P1>
<P1>j. The plaintiffs Andrew Beaulieu, Ola Beaulieu and Kyra Beaulieu were all provided with medical attention, charged and released on promises to appear.</P1></P>
<P>7. The defendants say that the WPS and Macumber were acting in the course of the lawful execution of their duties as members of the WPS, pursuant to the provisions of the <EM>Criminal Code of Canada</EM>.</P>
<P>8. The methods used by the defendants were appropriate and were necessarily incidental to and reasonably necessary in order to safely, effectively and lawfully execute their duties. The defendants say that the forced used by them was necessary and appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
<P>9. The entry to room 220 of the hotel was conducted lawfully and reasonably in the circumstances and based upon reliable information after thorough, reasonable and prudent investigations, with the consent of the plaintiffs. The defendants deny that the privacy of the plaintiffs was breached and rely on section 5 of <EM>The Privacy Act</EM>.</P>
<P>10. The defendants deny that they converted any of the property of the plaintiffs. The electronic devices were not taken from the plaintiffs and used by the defendants for their own use but rather were placed on the wet bar of room 220 for safety reasons.</P>
<P>11. The defendants deny that the plaintiffs were unlawfully arrested and/or falsely detained. The arrests and detentions of the plaintiffs was performed lawfully and in accordance with the authority granted to the defendants by the common law and the <EM>Criminal Code of Canada</EM>. The defendants say that they believed on reasonable grounds that offences had been committed and that the detentions of the plaintiffs were necessary in order to prevent the continuation of the offences, The defendants plead and rely upon section 495 of the <EM>Criminal Code of Canada</EM>.</P>
<P>12. The defendants deny that the plaintiff Ola Beaulieu was maliciously prosecuted. Specifically, the defendants deny that they acted with malice.</P>
<P>13. The defendants deny that they committed any breach of <EM>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom Act</EM> or in any way denied the plaintiffs any of their rights.</P>
<P>14. The defendants say in the alternative that even if the plaintiffs suffered the damages as alleged, which is not admitted but denied, they were not as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of the defendants.</P>
<P>15. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs' claim should be dismissed with costs.</P>

<P>1. In reasons for judgment released May 27, 2019, the Court found that members of the Winnipeg Police, including the defendant Macumber entered the hotel room of the plaintiffs without just cause. A violent altercation ensued with Ola, Andrew and Kyra Beaulieu being falsely arrested for assault of a peace officer. Three of the four plaintiffs endured battery by the defendant Macumber and others. Kyra was forced from the room and not allowed to return. Kyuss witnessed the attack on his family, and in particular the senseless beating of his mother that left her unconscious and, as it appeared to Kyuss at first, dead. Damages were awarded in favour of Ola and Andrew Beaulieu. The court appears to have omitted consideration of whether damages should also be awarded in favour of Kyra for false imprisonment. It is respectfully submitted that in the circumstances found to have existed, all four plaintiffs should be compensated for the invasion of their privacy contrary to <EM>The Privacy Act</EM>, if not pursuant to section 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The considerations informing such an award overlap and intertwine.</P>
<P>2. It was found that Kyra was falsely imprisoned for the offence of assaulting a peace officer. The event is recorded on video. One can see Kyra peacefully sitting on a couch when approached by Macumber and other officers. She did not assault him, so there was no reasonable grounds. She was then taken against her will to a police station. She was thoroughly searched. From there, she was taken against her will to be &ldquo;medically cleared&rdquo; at a hospital. She was subjected to an unnecessary medical examination (to the obvious annoyance of the attending emergency physician) before being eventually released with a court date. She had to watch the officers eat lunch while she went hungry. Even if she had assaulted Macumber in the way he alleged, her arrest was not necessary to identify her, preserve evidence or prevent the repetition of the offence. There was no evidence that her attendance in court could not have been secured with a summons. The search incident to this unlawful arrest uncovered marihuana which she readily handed over but put her in further legal jeopardy. The only thing distinguishing this from malicious prosecution is the fact that she apologized to Macumber to get her charges dropped. It is respectfully submitted that there should be an award of general and punitive damages in her favour for false imprisonment. Constitutional or Privacy Act Damages</P>
<P>3. At paragraph 108, the Court wrote:
<QUOTE><P>[108] Without deciding the question as to whether Charter damages are appropriate in this case, I have not had the benefit of a fulsome analysis of the Ward framework and it would not be appropriate to make such an important decision in the absence of that analysis. While I am satisfied that the state has breached the Charter rights of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have not established which function would be satisfied with Charter damages. Moreover, without that analysis, the City of Winnipeg has not been called upon to address the question of countervailing considerations. Furthermore, there is the consideration as to whether Charter damages would duplicate private law damages which are also sought by the plaintiffs. I therefore decline to go further on this important issue.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>4. The four part framework for awarding Charter damages was set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Ward v. Vancouver</SOC><CITE>2010 SCC 27</CITE></CASEREF> (Tab 8 of the defendants' pretrial brief). First the claimant must establish the deprivation of a Charter right. Second, a claimant must demonstrate that an award of damages would serve a functional purpose by meeting at least one of the objectives of ss. 24(1): compensation, vindication or deterrence. Third there must be no countervailing factors that would militate against an award of Charter damages. At the fourth stage, the Court should award an amount of damages that is just and appropriate in the circumstances. The Supreme Court reminds that these damages are awarded, not against the individual state actors, but against the state itself and it is this feature which distinguishes Charter damages from other types of relief: <CASEREF><SOC>Ward v. Vancouver</SOC></CASEREF>, supra, at para. 22.</P>
<P>5. There was a denial of the right of all four plaintiffs to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. The first part is met, supra.</P>
<P>6. In terms of the function of Charter damages, the Supreme Court wrote:
<QUOTE><P>[25] I therefore turn to the purposes that an order for damages under s. 24(1) may serve. For damages to be awarded, they must further the general objects of the Charter. This reflects itself in three interrelated functions that damages may serve. The function of compensation, usually the most prominent function, recognizes that breach of an individual's Charter rights may cause personal loss which should be remedied. The function of vindication recognizes that Charter rights must be maintained, and cannot be allowed to be whittled away by attrition. Finally, the function of deterrence recognizes that damages may serve to deter future breaches by state actors.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>7. In summary: compensation, vindication and deterrence are the purposes of Charter damages.</P>
<P>8. Compensation, as the Court noted, is usually the most prominent function which recognizes that Charter breaches can cause personal loss. &ldquo;In the public law damages context, courts have variously recognized this harm as distress, humiliation, embarrassment, and anxiety&rdquo; [para. 27].</P>
<P>9. It is in the nature of the right to privacy that it's breach will cause no physical harm. While the common law has always protected the right to privacy in the form of the actions of trespass to person and property, it did not, historically, extend that protection to the protection of personal privacy as that term is understood in modem times.</P>
<P>10. According to Bruce Phillips, Privacy Commissioner of Canada in a speech to the Canadian Bar Association, January 28, 2000:<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/speeches/archive/02_05_a_000128/</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>The modern formulation of the concept of privacy was stated by two young American jurists. Warren and Brandeis, in an 1890 article in the Harvard Law Review. Warren and Brandeis described privacy as &ldquo;the right to be let alone&rdquo;. From that basic formulation of the right has emerged a series of refinements that encompass the right or interest in being protected from many of the unjustified intrusions that afflict modern society. The concept of privacy now encompasses a collection of interests: protection of personal information, physical privacy, freedom from surveillance, privacy of one's surroundings, and privacy of one's personality&mdash;that is, the right not have one's personality appropriated.</P>
<P>Instruments at the heart of modem international law have accorded prominence to privacy. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights have all recognized privacy as one of the essential human rights.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>11. The common law evolved in Canada with the first recognition of invasion of privacy as a tort in the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Krouse v. Chrysler Ltd.</SOC><CITE>1973 CanLii 574</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> where misappropriation of personality was confirmed as a distinct cause of action. A few years after that in 1977, the Government of Manitoba codified the cause of action of invasion of privacy in <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> C.C.S.M. c. P125. That act provides.
<QUOTE><SEC><N>2</N>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>An action for violation of privacy may be brought without proof of damage. It also provides a non-exclusive list of considerations in arriving at an appropriate award of damages in ss. 4(2)</SSECP></SSEC></SEC>
<SEC><N>4</N><TI>Considerations in awarding damages</TI>
<SSEC><N>(2)</N><SSECP>In awarding damages in an action for a violation of privacy of a person, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>the nature, incidence and occasion of the act, conduct or publication constituting the violation of privacy of that person;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(b)</N><PARAP>the effect of the violation of privacy on the health, welfare, social, business or financial position of that person or his family;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(c)</N><PARAP>any relationship, whether domestic or otherwise, between the parties to the action;</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(d)</N><PARAP>any distress, annoyance or embarrassment suffered by that person or his family arising from the violation of privacy; and</PARAP></PARA>
<PARA><N>(e)</N><PARAP>the conduct of that person and the defendant, both before and after the commission of the violation of privacy, including any apology or offer of amends made by the defendant.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>12. It is noteworthy that the act refers to violation of privacy of a person...&rdquo; Thus, the circumstances of each of the plaintiffs should be considered separately under the act. The court should have regard to all of the circumstances of the case &ldquo;including&rdquo; the enumerated factors. The action for invasion of privacy in this case crystalized in the instant the officers crossed the threshold into the hotel room. The events that followed are the &ldquo;nature, incidence and occasion of the act&rdquo; &ldquo;Distress, annoyance or embarrassment&rdquo; are compensable. The fact the defendants did not apologize or offer amends must be considered, particularly in the context of punitive damages.</P>
<P>13. The intrusion in this case was particularly serious. Patrol Sergeant Cot&ea; was on the scene supervising the operation. It was not a case of well intentioned officers exceeding the scope of their authority in carrying out an otherwise lawful investigation. Four officers entered the room at 11: 25 p.m. under the direction of a street supervisor. This set the stage for a nightmare scenario to unfold. The plaintiffs have not been individually compensated for this aspect of the case. A search of the room and the personal effects of the plaintiffs took place which is in addition to the trespass to property that occurred.</P>
<P>14. The plaintiffs suffered damages in different ways. Andrew Beaulieu and Ola Beaulieu as heads of the family were responsible for protecting their children and guest. Their ability to do that was taken from them by the defendants. They have been afforded just compensation for the battery, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution that resulted, but not for the erosion of their dignity that flowed immediately from the warrantless and unlawful entry into their dwelling by the officers of the state. While Andrew may have been making a nuisance of himself which led to the initial attendance of the police, Ola was innocent of any misconduct. There were lawful alternatives open to the police, including issuing a warning to Mr. Beaulieu, or applying for a warrant for his arrest. Even an entry warrant for Andrew's arrest could have been granted if he had refused to surrender himself at the door. When the police entered, Mr. Beaulieu was not wearing a shirt and was not in the most lucid state of mind, which increased his humiliation. The lateness of the hour, the fact that they had been consuming alcohol and should have been entitled to be &ldquo;left alone&rdquo; in that condition are factors that the Court can appropriately consider in assessing appropriate compensation.</P>
<P>15. Kyra was subjected to &ldquo;distress, humiliation, embarrassment and anxiety&rdquo;, the severity and extent of which was well documented by Cheyenne Mills videotaping her reaction to the police intrusion. That she was traumatized by seeing her parents beaten and bloody was a direct result of the deprivation of her personal privacy. That emotional state was not brought about by the batteries committed against her by Macumber. The seizure of her recording device while actionable in itself as a battery was an aggravating feature of the denial of her right to be left alone in the safety of her residence.</P>
<P>16. Kyuss was not injured physically, but the trauma of seeing his parents treated in such a violent fashion will never leave him. As a minor, he was entitled to the protection of the Canadian state. In the security of his dwelling, he should have been safe. Instead, he saw his mother punched repeatedly by a much larger policeman until she lost consciousness and appeared to him to be deceased. Macumber then threatened him by asking if he wanted some too. It is ironic and aggravating that the defendants attempted to rely on <EM>The Child and Family Services Act</EM> when.it was their conduct that rendered this child in need of protection from them. This is an offence under ss 18.3(a) of <EM>The Child and Family Services Act</EM>:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>18.3</N><TI>Offences</TI><SECP>Where a person,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>through an act or omission of the person, causes a child to be a child in need of protection as provided in section 17; &ellipsis;</PARAP></PARA>
the person is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than $50,000 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 24 months, or both.</SECP></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>17. Although Kyuss was uninjured physically, as the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 27 in Ward:
<QUOTE><P>Often the harm to intangible interests effected by a breach of rights will merge with psychological harm. But a resilient claimant whose intangible interests are harmed should not be precluded from recovering damages simply because she cannot prove a substantial psychological injury.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. The constitutional purpose of compensation need not be duplicated if the same damages are otherwise available. The plaintiffs are not seeking double compensation for the breach of their Charter right to privacy as well as their statutory right to privacy. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ernst v. Quinonez</SOC><CITE>2003 CanLII 20579</CITE><COURTJUR>ON SC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> the court observed (and the plaintiffs take no issue with this statement):
<QUOTE><P>[106] It should be noted that if a plaintiff is otherwise entitled to an award of damages, and the defendant's conduct has also breached the plaintiff's Charter rights, the plaintiff is still only entitled to one set of compensatory damages. The plaintiff is not entitled to any additional or extra damages solely because the defendant has breached the plaintiff's Charter rights and by the same conduct has also committed another tort.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>19. Charter damages, as opposed to <EM>Privacy Act</EM> damages are explicitly designed to achieve two further purposes: vindication and deterrence. Such damages would serve to vindicate the right of persons to be secure in their dwellings, a core constitutional right, and to prevent the slow whittling away of it. Without a specific defence or &ldquo;vindication&rdquo; of the Charter right at stake here, there is the risk of a gradual acceptance of such conduct over time. Ward at paragraph 28:
<QUOTE><P>While one may speak of vindication as underlining the seriousness of the harm done to the claimant, vindication as an object of constitutional damages focuses on the harm the Charter breach causes to the state and to society.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>20. Vindication is not an express consideration under <EM>The Privacy Act</EM>, but it is arguably a consideration of the surrounding circumstances. The jurisprudence under <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> is still at an early stage and has not, to the writer's knowledge addressed this purpose. Enhancing the respect of the state for privacy and promoting respect for the rule of law is arguably quite consistent with the overall purpose of <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> however.</P>
<P>21. Deterrence looms large where the intrusion has official sanction in the form of a commanding officer at the scene directing and later defending the violation as he did at trial. The facts of this case have been found to be and are indeed egregious. An additional award of punitive damages under <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> would meet the objective of deterrence without the necessity of engaging the Charter. But the considerations relative to Charter damages are also relevant to and inform the analysis of damages pursuant to <EM>The Privacy Act</EM>. The conduct of these defendants in casually and unlawfully entering a dwelling as if they owned the place is deserving of an award of punitive damages in favour of each plaintiff in an amount rationally sufficient to deter it's repetition by other officers and their commanders. As the Court held in Ward at paragraph 29:
<QUOTE><P>Similarly, deterrence as an object of Charter damages is not aimed at deterring the specific wrongdoer, but rather at influencing government behaviour in order to secure state compliance with the Charter in the future,</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>22. It is respectfully submitted that all three of the purposes of Charter damages are engaged on the facts of this case. It is respectfully submitted that there is nearly perfect overlap between the two heads of damages.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Countervailing Factors</TI>
<P>23. The third step in the analysis is whether there are factors that militate against an award of Charter damages. The Supreme Court provided this guidance in Ward, paragraph 33:
<QUOTE><P>[33] However, even if the claimant establishes that damages are functionally justified, the state may establish that other considerations render s. 24(1) damages inappropriate or unjust. A complete catalogue of countervailing considerations remains to be developed as the law in this area matures. At this point, however, two considerations are apparent: the existence of alternative remedies and concerns for good governance..</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The defendants now have an opportunity to establish which countervailing considerations, if any, would militate against an award of constitutional damages. As discussed above, an award of general and punitive damages under <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> would serve the same purposes of compensation, vindication and deterrence as Charter damages. The same state would be responsible for payment whether awarded under the Charter or under the <EM>Act</EM>. Whether under the Charter or the <EM>Act</EM>, however, it is respectfully submitted that each of these plaintiffs was affected in different and in substantial ways by the incursion. Each of them, should have an individual assessment of damages. Quantum</P>
<P>24. The seminal case in damages for trespass to property is <CASEREF><SOC>Entick v. Carrington</SOC><CITE>19 Howell's State trials 1029</CITE><COURTJUR>1765</COURTJUR></CASEREF> [Tab 1]. It is also an early case of damages being awarded not so much as compensation, but as vindication of the right to private property. By a defective warrant issued by Lord Halifax, the defendants forced entry to the plaintiff's residence, searched for four hours, opening boxes, reading private papers and ultimately carrying off some of those papers. This in pursuance of a defamation claim. Much of the case is concerned with defences raised by the officers of Lord Halifax, all of which failed. The court held
<QUOTE><P>By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my ground without my license, but he is liable to an action, though the damage be nothing; which is proved by every declaration in trespass, where the defendant is called upon to answer for bruising the grass and even treading upon the soil. If he admits the fact, he is bound to show by way of justification, that some positive law has empowered or excused him. The justification is submitted to the judges, who are to look into the books; and if such a justification can be maintained by the text of the statute law, or by the principles of common law. If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>The emergence of the right to privacy, as distinct from the tort of trespass can be seen:
<QUOTE><P>Papers are the owner's goods and chattels: they are his dearest property; and are so far from enduring a seizure, that they will hardly bear an inspection; and though the eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of a trespass, yet where private papers are removed and carried away, the secret nature of those goods will be an aggravation of the trespass, and demand more considerable damages in that respect.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Damages of 300 <EM>l.</EM> were awarded in 1762. According to an online inflation calculator, the 2018 value of that award is 525,000 <EM>l.</EM> or $840,357.29 Canadian funds as of the present exchange rate of 1 GBP = 1.60068 CAD.</P>
<P>25. In his helpful text, Police Civil Liability, Paul Ceyssens summarizes the caselaw respecting damages for trespass/invasion of privacy/breach of Charter Rights at pages 3-73 to 3.74. And 3-326 to [Tab 2]. Reference is made to the discussion in <CASEREF><SOC>Young v. Ewatski</SOC><CITE>2008 MBQB 148</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2008 MBCA 150</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> [Tab 3]. In that case Winnipeg applied to dismiss a claim for punitive damages based on a warrantless entry to a dwelling. In allowing the appeal from a Master's order granting that relief, the Court found a genuine issue for trial in connection with the claim for relief under section 24(1) of the Charter. The evolving law in this area is explained in the judgment of Justice Schulman. This, however, predates Ward. Justice Schulman concluded:
<QUOTE><P>[17] Counsel for the parties have not cited any authority related to the criteria for an award of damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter. The facts of the cases referred to in &para;16 above are the closest circumstances to entry without a search warrant of which I am aware. It is reasonably possible that an assessment of whether the officers acted in good faith will be a relevant consideration in making a final determination of this claim. The state of mind of the officers cannot be assessed on a motion for summary judgment and gives rise to a genuine issue for trial. Moreover, it is clear from the authorities cited in &para;14 to &para;16 above and the cases referred to therein that the question of what the criteria are for an award of punitive damages is an area of law that is evolving and cannot be resolved on this motion.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. The state of mind of the officers is a consideration that is stressed at both levels of our courts. Officers acting in good faith would rarely attract an award of punitive damages. Officers acting as they did in this case, however, are not in that category. In terms of Manitoba precedent, the case of <CASEREF><SOC>Ironstand v. Winnipeg</SOC><CITE>2017 MBQB 192</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2019 MBCA 70</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> (CanLII) [Tab 4] is directly relevant. Our courts declined to make an award of punitive damages where (per the trial decision)
<QUOTE><P>[37] Given my finding that the [defendant] police [officers] acted proportionally and in good faith, and that their entry into the home was minimally intrusive in that they did not force entry, did not cause any damage, and were in the residence for only as long as it took to sort the situation out, there is no basis for punitive or aggravated damages.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>Even so, the Court awarded $2,500.00 general damages for a (good faith) late night unlawful entry to a dwelling.</P>
<P>27. The Court of Appeal declined to intervene, despite finding an error of law. That court held
<QUOTE><P>[14] At the outset of our analysis, we state without hesitation that, based on the facts of this case, the trial judge did not err when he declined to award punitive damages or public law damages. The trial judge's explanation as to why he was declining to make an award under those heads is reasonable and his comments with respect to proportionality and good faith are appropriate in the context of those two heads of damages. We are not convinced that the actions of the defendant police officers, although found to be unlawful, are of such a nature as to attract an award of punitive damages or public law damages. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not fall into error in declining to make an award of damages under these heads of damages.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>This case, however is different. Here the officers were not acting in good faith and their conduct was egregious and violent. These are exactly the circumstances that warrant a substantial award of punitive damages, whether under trespass, <EM>The Privacy Act</EM> or the Charter in favour of each of the four plaintiffs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Costs</TI>
<P>28. Costs should follow the event, and are of course in the discretion of the Court. From the outset in their statement of claim, the plaintiffs claimed lawyer and client costs. As late as November 30, 2018, two weeks prior to the commencement of the trial, counsel for the defendants confirmed that they would not be relying on any defence not mentioned in the statement of defence unless notice was given. [Tab 5] The defendants contested the claim through a trial and despite initially claiming that they were invited into the hotel room in their statement of defence, claimed for the first time at trial that they entered to protect children under the CFS Act. There was no advance notice of that other than the inclusion of the CFS Act in their casebook at the beginning of the trial. That evidence was rejected as was much of the evidence of the defendants. The conduct of the defendant Macumber was malicious and he stood by the absurd claim that he repeatedly punched Ola Beaulieu in the face as hard as he could in self defence. The threshold for an award of solicitor client costs is admittedly high: &ldquo;Solicitor-client costs are generally awarded only where there has been reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of one of the parties.&rdquo; <CASEREF><SOC>Young v. Young</SOC><CITE>993 CanLII 34</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>[ 1993] 4 S.C.R. 3</CITE><PAGENUM>at p. 134</PAGENUM></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>. The standard is met on the facts of this litigation. There is authority that malicious conduct attracts &ldquo;substantial indemnity&rdquo; costs: <CASEREF><SOC>Hawley v. Bapoo</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 503</CITE></CASEREF> [Tab 6].</P>
<P>29. This can even apply to pre-litigation conduct: <CASEREF><SOC>Judges of the Provincial Court (Man.) v. Manitoba et al.</SOC><CITE>2013 MBCA 74</CITE></CASEREF> (CanLII) [Tab 7] This would not be a case of double compensation, such as <CASEREF><SOC>Lynch v. Hashemian</SOC><CITE>2006 SKCA 126</CITE></CASEREF> [Tab 8] where solicitor client costs were awarded as an alternative to punitive damages in circumstances where the trial judge found that &ldquo;...three members of the Saskatoon Police Service behaved professionally, and with restraint, in their dealings with [the plaintiff].&rdquo; The judge also awarded damages for a gratuitous assault during the course of the arrest. The $6,000.00 costs were reduced to party and party costs on appeal but $7,500.00 punitive damages were added.</P>
<P>30. The plaintiffs respectfully request that costs be awarded on a lawyer and client basis. Counsel for the plaintiffs acted on a contingency agreement that provides an amount of fees based on half of the first five thousand awarded plus 33% of the balance plus PST and GST on that total and disbursements. The amount of costs would remain to be determined based on the final award.</P>
<P>31. Costs according to Class 2 of the tariff would otherwise be tabulated as follows:

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>PART I&mdash;SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>On December 26, 2014, several members of the Winnipeg Police Service (&ldquo;WPS&rdquo;) attended at the Clarion Hotel in response to three 911 calls, two from hotel staff, and one from a crying guest who was alone in her room and afraid of a man trying to get in. The WPS officers were informed that the man was intoxicated, knocking on doors, and yelling in the hallway. He was described as hostile and unpredictable. The hotel management advised that there appeared to be underage children who were smoking marijuana and requested that all of the parties be removed due to persistent, unacceptable and disruptive behaviour.</P>
<P>After several days of trial, on May 27, 2019 the Court released its 41 page decision in this matter. Despite the Defendants' position that they attended in good faith, for a legitimate purpose and within the scope of their authority, the Court ultimately found that the WPS officers entered room 220 unlawfully. The Court awarded damages against the Defendants and costs. It indicated that if counsel could not agree on costs, submissions could be made to the Court.</P>
<P>The parties counsel could not agree on costs, and consequently, Plaintiffs' counsel requested a date to appear before the Court. While doing so, Plaintiffs' counsel also unilaterally requested to be heard, and filed a brief on the adequacy of the Court's decision, with respect to damages.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;LEGAL ISSUES AND THE POSITION OF THE DEFENDANTS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><N>1.</N><TI>The Plaintiffs should not be permitted to make submissions on damages&mdash;The Court is functus officio.</TI>
<P>The doctrine of <EM>functus officio</EM> states that an adjudicator, be it an arbitrator, an administrative tribunal, or a court, once it has reached its decision cannot afterwards alter its award except to correct clerical mistakes or errors arising from an accidental slip or omission (<CASEREF><SOC>Re Nelsons Laundries Ltd. and Laundry, Dry Cleaning and Dye House Workers' International Union, Local No. 292</SOC><YEAR>1964</YEAR><CITE>1964 CanLII 506</CITE><COURTJUR>BC SC</COURTJUR><CASEHIST><CASEREF><CITE>44 D.L.R. (2d) 463</CITE><COURTJUR>B.C.S.C.</COURTJUR></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>) &ldquo;To allow adjudicator to again deal with the matter of its own volition, without hearing the entire matter &lsquo;afresh&rsquo; is contrary to this doctrine&rdquo; (appellants' factum, at p. 19).

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Missing Damage Award</UNDER></TI>
<P>The Plaintiff Kyra Beaulieu (&ldquo;Kyra&rdquo;) is seeking additional damages for false imprisonment. In many cases where false imprisonment is claimed, the Plaintiff also claims other heads of damages, including false arrest, battery and malicious prosecution. In many decisions, the Court provides a global amount of general damages and does not indicate what portion of the award applies specifically to false imprisonment. The Court conducted a thorough analysis of each head of damage claimed by the Plaintiffs, and in paragraphs 114&mdash;124 assessed the damages for each plaintiff. The damages were awarded in the aggregate and were not broken down by tort. It is presumptuous to suggest that the Court did not consider the totality of its findings in assessing Kyra's award of general damages and to expect that additional damages be awarded at this stage after the decision has been rendered. The Plaintiffs' submissions are akin to an appeal to the Trial Judge. The appropriate step is to file an appe al, not to request the Trial Judge to reconsider its damage award.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>2.</N><TI>If the Plaintiffs are permitted to make submissions on damages, the Court should decline to award additional damages.</TI>
<P>In the unlikely event that the Court did inadvertently make a &ldquo;clerical mistake&rdquo; or &ldquo;accidental omission&rdquo; with respect to Kyra's damages and wishes to assess damages in this regard, the amount should be nominal. There was video evidence before the court supporting the allegation that Kyra caused a disturbance in the hallway at the Clarion Hotel, and she indicated she was in possession of Cannabis. Because she was pregnant, the officers, in good faith, took the precautionary measure to have Kyra medically cleared. A substantial portion of Kyra's detention consisted of waiting at the Misericordia Hospital to see and be cleared by a doctor.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the Plaintiffs' Outline of Damages filed before trial does not list false imprisonment as a category of damages. In <CASEREF><SOC>Ironstand v. Winnipeg</SOC><CITE>2017 MBQB 192</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2019 MBCA 70</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF>, the amount awarded for false imprisonment was $500. In <CASEREF><SOC>Everett et al. v. McCaskill et al.</SOC><CITE>2014 MBQB 185</CITE><CASEHIST><CASEDISP>affirmed</CASEDISP><CASEREF><CITE>2015 MBCA 107</CITE></CASEREF></CASEHIST></CASEREF> [Tab 2], the amount was provisionally assessed at $1,000 per plaintiff.

<P>All four Plaintiffs are seeking damages for invasion of privacy either by way of the <EM>Privacy Act</EM> or section 24(1) of the <EM>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</EM> (&ldquo;<EM>Charter</EM>&rdquo;). At paragraph 108 of the Court's decision in this matter, it declined to award <EM>Charter</EM> damages because, &ldquo;...the Plaintiffs have not established which function would be satisfied with <EM>Charter</EM> damages&rdquo; and correspondingly the Defendants did not have an opportunity to address countervailing considerations. The Plaintiffs are seeking to make submissions and have this issue considered by the Court after the fact.</P>
<P>The Court is <EM>functus officio</EM> and therefore the Court cannot hear and the Plaintiffs cannot present new allegations, make additional argument and seek additional damages when it ought to have done so at trial. The Plaintiffs filed <CASEREF><SOC>Elmardy v. Toronto Police Services Board</SOC><CITE>2017 ONSC 2074</CITE></CASEREF> in its Book of Authorities at Tab 3 and as such was familiar with the <EM>Ward</EM> Framework and the purposes of <EM>Charter</EM> damages.</P>
<P>If the Court finds that it is able to consider and award <EM>Charter</EM> damages after its decision, the Court should decline to award additional damages because the private law damages meet the functions of <EM>Charter</EM> damages and are unnecessary in the circumstances.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Ward v. Vancouver</SOC></CASEREF> <BOLD>(Tab 10 of the Defendants' Pre-trial Brief)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>As outlined in the Court's decision in this matter, and in other leading jurisprudence relating to <EM>Charter</EM> damages, public law damages are against the state, not an individual. Although, the Court's decision does not specify which Defendant is required to pay the damages to the Plaintiffs, <EM>The Police Services Act</EM>, CCSM c P94.5 [Tab 3] is clear that the City of Winnipeg will be compensating the Plaintiffs for the damages and costs awarded in this matter.
<P1><BOLD><EM>The Police Services Act (Tab 3)</EM></BOLD></P1></P>
<P>When considering whether to award <EM>Charter</EM> damages on the basis of compensation, the Court must avoid double compensation. The Plaintiffs have already been adequately compensated by the private law damages, including a large punitive damage award.

<P>The declaration that the Plaintiffs' <EM>Charter</EM> rights were breached achieves the objective of vindication and further damages would be unfair to the residents of Winnipeg, who will ultimately pay for the damages through public dollars.</P>
<P>Just as private law damages must be fair to both the plaintiff and the defendant, so s. 24(1) damages must be fair&mdash;or &ldquo;appropriate and just&rdquo;&mdash;to both the claimant and the state. The court must arrive at a quantum that respects this. Large awards and the consequent diversion of public funds may serve little functional purpose in terms of the claimant's needs and may be inappropriate or unjust from the public perspective. In considering what is fair to the claimant and the state, the court may take into account the public interest in good governance, the danger of deterring governments from undertaking beneficial new policies and programs, and the need to avoid diverting large sums of funds from public programs to private interests.

<P>The function of deterrence has been met, and the Court's dissatisfaction is indicative by the fact that the punitive damages exceed the general and special damages. In fact, this is one of the highest awards of damages ever awarded against the City of Winnipeg for conduct of WPS officers.</P>
<P>There is not an abundance of case law on lawful police entry or trespass in hotel rooms; <EM>Ironstand</EM> is a very recent case and involves an entry at the Plaintiffs home, not a hotel. <CASEREF><SOC>While R. v. Wong</SOC></CASEREF> specifically addressed warrantless video surveillance in hotel rooms, this decision further clarifies the law with respect to warrantless entry in hotel rooms. The Court's declaration that the Plaintiffs' <EM>Charter</EM> rights were breached will in and of itself necessitate a change in police conduct moving forward in the context of hotel rooms. Accordingly, the functions of <EM>Charter</EM> damages have been met without the need to award of <EM>Charter</EM> damages.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>3.</N><TI>The Plaintiffs should not be awarded Solicitor and Client Costs</TI>
<P>With respect to the Plaintiffs' assertions of the Defendants' conduct, the Defendants provided disclosure to the Plaintiffs prior to trial that clearly indicated that the WPS officers who attended the Clarion Hotel were informed there were minors in the hotel room with the intoxicated male that gave rise to the 911 calls. There was nothing scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible about the Defendants during the litigation. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs' disclosure of numerous photographs for the first time on the second day of trial was highly inappropriate.</P>
<P>The punitive damages awarded by this Court addressed any pre-litigation conduct and its findings regarding credibility that might be leveraged against t he Defendants when assessing the appropriateness of solicitor and client costs. If the Court were to award solicitor and client costs, it would amount to double compensation.
<QUOTE><P>The important point is that the conduct should not be at the very heart of the proceedings and, as such compensable in damages, including punitive damages. Otherwise, double compensation would result.</P></QUOTE>

<P>The Plaintiffs' brief indicates that the Plaintiffs entered into a contingency agreement with the Plaintiffs' Counsel. The formula accounts only for the Plaintiffs' agreement and not the actual legal fees accrued by Plaintiffs' Counsel or the value of the legal services provided (<EM>quantum meruit</EM>). It is open to the Plaintiffs to challenge the final account rendered by their counsel in accordance with Rule 71 of the <EM>Court of Queen's Bench Rules</EM> [Tab 5] and section 55(5) of the <EM>Legal Profession Act</EM> [Tab 6]. Alternatively, if the Court were to award solicitor and client costs, it should be based on an assessment of fair and reasonable legal fees and not the terms of the contingency agreement. Given the Court's inherent jurisdiction to determine the fairness and reasonableness of legal fees, the Court ought to be provided with and consider all relevant information.

<P>The Defendants estimate party and party costs to be in the range of $16,000.00 [Tab 8]. The Defendants submit that the Plaintiffs' miscalculated their entitlement pursuant to Rule 5(2)(m) of the Costs Tariff [Tab 9], but otherwise accept the Plaintiffs' computation of party and party costs.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
