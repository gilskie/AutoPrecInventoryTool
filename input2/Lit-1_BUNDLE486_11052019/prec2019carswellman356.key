<BLOCK1><TI>CLAIM</TI>
<P>1. The plaintiffs claim:
<P1>a) General damages in an amount to be determined by this Honourable Court;</P1>
<P1>b) Special damages in an amount not yet ascertained and to be established at trial;</P1>
<P1>c) Punitive, aggravated and exemplary damages in an amount to be determined by this Honourable Court;</P1>
<P1>d) Interest in accordance with the Queen's Bench Act;</P1>
<P1>e) Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P>2. The plaintiff Patrick Guilbert (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Guilbert&rdquo;) is a resident of the Town of Neepawa, in the Province of Manitoba, and at all times material hereto, is and was an entrepreneur; the plaintiff Guilbert Enterprises Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Enterprises&rdquo;) was a company, the shares of which were owned by the plaintiff Guilbert, and was a Manitoba company.</P>
<P>3. The defendant is an insurance company registered as such in the Province of Manitoba to carry on business and is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Canada. Its head office is in Waterloo, in the Province of Ontario.</P>
<P>4. The plaintiffs state that they operated a business operated as Neepawa Home Hardware in the Town of Neepawa, in Manitoba.</P>
<P>5. The plaintiffs state that they had a commercial insurance policy with the defendant under Policy No. 9385038.</P>
<P>6. The plaintiffs state further, that on or about 6: 00 p.m. on February 25, 2015, the store known as Neepawa Home Hardware, at XXXXXXXXXX, burned to the ground. The plaintiffs state further that above the main level of the building owned by the plaintiff Enterprises, were condo residences that had been built by the plaintiffs and were occupied at the time of the fire.</P>
<P>7. The plaintiffs state that the fire was accidental and that the Fire Commissioner of Manitoba, investigated said fire and concluded in its report that &ldquo;there is no possibility, nor was there the opportunity for human action to have caused this fire in the identified area of origin. The only source of ignition in this area is electrical wiring&rdquo;.</P>
<P>8. The plaintiffs state that the conclusions of the Fire Commissioner were at all times material known to the defendant.</P>
<P>9. The plaintiffs state that Enterprises submitted a Proof of Loss in final form to the defendant on June 17, 2015.</P>
<P>10. The plaintiffs state that by correspondence from counsel for the defendant to counsel for the plaintiffs, the defendant denied liability and alleged that the plaintiff Guilbert deliberately and criminally set the fire which caused the loss in question.</P>
<P>11. The plaintiffs state that the policy of insurance with the defendant was a replacement cost policy and that the amount of insurance loss claimed and the proof of loss was, for building equipment and fixtures and furniture, a total of $3,022,593.80, particulars of which will be provided at the trial.</P>
<P>12. The plaintiffs state that the defendant has refused without justification to cover the said loss which refusal was a breach of the policy of insurance between the defendant and the plaintiff Enterprises. The plaintiffs state that the defendant, taking the position as it has that the fire loss was caused by the criminal act of the plaintiff Guilbert, is false and egregious; the plaintiff Guilbert states further, that at all times material hereto, the defendant knew that the plaintiff Guilbert was the operating mind of the plaintiff Enterprises.</P>
<P>13. The plaintiffs state that the allegation by the defendant of the criminal act of arson, has been made by the defendant falsely and maliciously and designed to provide it an economic benefit. It has caused the plaintiff Guilbert emotional distress, angst and reputational damage and is a breach of the duty of good faith and a breach of contract (as between the defendant and plaintiff Enterprises).</P>
<P>14. The plaintiff states that the defendant has maintained its position that the plaintiffs were involved in a criminal offence vitiating the insurance policy in the face of a Fire Commissioner's report exonerating the plaintiffs and declaring that the fire was innocently set and did so falsely, egregiously, and in a reckless and highhanded manner, and therefore, the defendant should be liable to pay punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The defendant admits the allegations contained in paragraphs 3 and 10 of the statement of claim.</P>
<P>2. The defendant denies the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the statement of claim and further denies that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed in paragraph 1 thereof.</P>
<P>3. As to paragraph 2 of the statement of claim, it is the defendant's understanding that Patrick Guilbert (Patrick) was not the only shareholder of the corporate plaintiff.</P>
<P>4. As to paragraph 4 of the statement of claim, the business in question was operated by the corporate plaintiff.</P>
<P>5. As to paragraph 6 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that
<P1>(a) at or about 6: 00 p.m. on February 25, 2015, Patrick caused a fire to be ignited in the attic space between the ground level store at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX and the apartments above;</P1>
<P1>(b) when the employees left that day at about 6: 00 p.m., Patrick stayed behind, in the store, for a few minutes, setting the burglar alarm at 6: 09 as he was leaving;</P1>
<P1>(c) Patrick's opportunity to set the fire was exclusive;</P1>
<P1>(d) though Patrick had at one time hoped or intended to convert the four apartments to condominiums, this had not occurred before the fire and indeed Patrick had found no buyers for the intended condominium units;</P1>
<P1>(e) the fire, or smoke from it, was first observed by third parties and the fire department was called at 6:13 p.m.;</P1>
<P1>(f) though the fire was confined to the aforesaid attic space when the firefighters arrived, they were not able to extinguish the fire, and the building, apart from the basement, and including the apartments above, was a total loss; and</P1>
<P1>(g) the apartments were evacuated before the fire spread to them.</P1></P>
<P>6. As to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that: (a) the fire occurred at a time when the corporate plaintiff was having difficulty paying its employees, Patrick had recently learned that the hoped-for sale of the business to a local business-person would not occur, the corporate plaintiff had received a tax demand from the provincial taxing authority, the corporate plaintiff had in late 2014 received notice that orders for new inventory by the corporate plaintiff required special approval, and the corporate plaintiff was insolvent;
<P1>(a) the fire was set by Patrick;</P1>
<P1>(b) the fire commissioner was mistaken in saying, and had no basis whatever to say, that human action could not have caused the fire;</P1>
<P1>(c) there was and is no evidence whatever that the fire was caused by an electrical problem or malfunction; and</P1>
<P1>(d) the defendant did not receive the report of the fire commissioner until October, 2015, and had no earlier notice of the opinion or reasoning of the fire commissioner.</P1></P>
<P>7. As to paragraph 9 of the statement of claim, the defendant acknowledges that the corporate plaintiff did submit a form of proof of loss to the defendant on or about June 18, 2015.</P>
<P>8. As to paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that in later August, 2015, counsel for the defendant wrote to then counsel for the plaintiffs as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Economical has now had an opportunity to carefully review your client's second proof of loss in this matter and the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the loss.</P>
<P>As you know, in any claim, the insured and the insurer each owe the other a duty of good faith. Among other things, this requires that the insured in the presentation of his claim be honest and forthright. This is in fact confirmed in statutory conditions 6 and 7 of the policy and in <EM>The Insurance Act</EM> itself, where the statutory conditions are codified.</P>
<P>Economical's investigation has confirmed that at the time of the fire, the business was insolvent and about to fail. Your client had attempted to sell the business, but failed to do so. Your client had built the apartments above the store with a view to converting them to condominiums and raising capital through the sale of the units. This plan had also failed. Yet despite all these circumstances, in communication with Economical's agents after the fire, when Economical was interested in the financial situation of your insured's business, your client minimized the seriousness of the financial problems. This was an obvious effort to mislead Economical regarding your client's motive for committing arson.</P>
<P>Your client indicated to Economical after the fire that on the day of the fire, before he exited the building after the employees, he remained on the premises only for the purpose of setting the alarm. He said this would have taken him perhaps thirty seconds or a minute at most. But in fact, independent witnesses say that he remained on the premises for several minutes. This was to conceal the fact he had (and took) the opportunity to set the fire which was discovered within but a few minutes.</P>
<P>For these reasons, among others, Economical says that your client breached statutory conditions 6 and 7 and his duty of good faith. And for similar and other reasons, Economical says that your client deliberately committed arson in that Patrick Guilbert caused the fire to the business premises at XXXXXXXXXX. Accordingly the insurance claim of Guilbert Enterprises Ltd. c.o.b. Neepawa Home Hardware is hereby denied and its proof of loss rejected.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>9. As to paragraph 11 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that:
<P1>(a) replacement coverage was conditional on the defendant replacing the property damaged;</P1>
<P1>(b) plaintiffs did not replace any property, and took no steps to replace any property, and thus even if there were an entitlement to indemnification under the policy, that indemnification would not be on a replacement cost basis, but rather on an actual cash value basis;</P1>
<P1>(c) Patrick's object in setting the fire was to mitigate the precarious financial situations of the corporate plaintiff and Patrick;</P1>
<P1>(d) since the policy contained a mortgage clause, the defendant was obligated to make payments to mortgagees in the approximate amount of $600,000.00, which was approximately the actual cash value of the building; and</P1>
<P1>(e) plaintiffs benefitted from Patrick's actions to that extent.</P1></P>
<P>10. As to paragraph 12 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that:
<P1>(a) the defendant knew that Patrick was the directing mind of the corporate plaintiff in the context of the claim being presented to the defendant; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the defendant has correctly taken the position it has because of the overwhelming evidence of Patrick's financial motive to set the fire, his exclusive opportunity to set the fire and other matters which will be disclosed in the course of the discovery process.</P1></P>
<P>11. As to paragraphs 13 and 14 of the statement of claim, and in reply to the whole thereof, the defendant says that:
<P1>(a) it has not denied and would not deny coverage to its insured in this matter if it did not believe with good reason that its insured had breached the terms of coverage in a fundamental way;</P1>
<P1>(b) the plaintiffs owed a duty of good faith to the defendant;</P1>
<P1>(c) the plaintiffs were bound by statutory conditions 6 and 7;</P1>
<P1>(d) these duties and conditions meant that Patrick was bound as the directing mind of the corporate plaintiff to be honest and candid in his communications with the defendant;</P1>
<P1>(e) in contravention of the foresaid duties and conditions, Patrick, among other things, minimized the seriousness of the financial problems of the corporate plaintiff in an effort to mislead the defendant regarding the strength of the motive to commit arson, and stated that on the day of the fire he only remained in the building after the employees left for 30 seconds to a minute, when in fact it was significantly longer than that;</P1>
<P1>(f) at all material times, the defendant acted reasonably, prudently and fairly;</P1>
<P1>(g) the decision to deny any claim, including the corporate plaintiff's, on the basis of dishonesty and arson, is not taken lightly, but seriously; all of the evidence was weighed and balanced, and was reviewed by several experienced persons to ensure the decision was justified; and</P1>
<P1>(h) the defendant at all times acted in good faith.</P1></P>
<P>12. The plaintiffs' claim should therefore be dismissed with costs on a lawyer and client basis.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">COUNTERCLAIM</TI>
<P>13. The defendant claims against the plaintiff for:
<P1>(a) damages in an amount to be proved;</P1>
<P1>(b) interest;</P1>
<P1>(c) costs on a lawyer and client basis; and</P1>
<P1>(d) such further and other relief as this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>14. The defendant repeats the assertions contained in its statement of defence hereinbefore.</P>
<P>15. As a consequence of the plaintiffs' bad faith, dishonesty, fraud and arson, the defendant has sustained loss and damage in connection with, among other things:
<P1>(a) the mortgage clause in the policy, payments to:
<P2>i. Beautiful Plains Credit Union for $434,056.23, and</P2>
<P2>ii. Sunrise Credit Union for $162,055.77;</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) travel expenses for investigators and adjusters and experts;</P1>
<P1>(c) professional fees to have the plaintiffs' financial situation assessed $14,430.15;</P1>
<P1>(d) court reporter's fees of $2,409.50;</P1>
<P1>(e) site cleanup expenses of $45,773.20;</P1>
<P1>(f) security expenses of $5,962.42; and</P1>
<P1>(g) such other loss and damage as may be particularized in the course of the discovery process.</P1></P>
<P>16. Defendant is entitled to interest on the loss and damage caused it by the plaintiffs and to its costs on a lawyer and client basis.</P>

<P>1. The plaintiffs, defendants by counterclaim, repeat all allegations in their Statement of Claim and deny each and every allegation in the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</P>
<P>2. The plaintiffs specifically deny that the defendant Patrick Guilbert (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Patrick&rdquo;), had anything whatever to do with the setting of the fire and further deny that the fire was set at all, but was rather an accidental fire.</P>
<P>3. The plaintiffs state that at all times material hereto, the defendant was in possession of the Fire Commissioner's report, and has no information to the contrary about the cause of the fire. Its allegations of arson are thus unfounded, malicious and designed to cause harm financially, and otherwise, to the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>4. The plaintiffs state further that it was known to the defendant that the fire, more likely than not, started during the afternoon, when smoke was detected by smell, by employees of the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>5. Contrary therefore, to the allegations of the defendant, Patrick did not have exclusive opportunity to set a fire, and this was specifically known by the defendants; however, it is denied that the fire was anything but an accidental electrical fire.</P>
<P>6. Further, the apartments upstairs were all occupied, giving additional proof of the absence of exclusivity of Patrick, a fact not only known by the defendant, but referenced in the Statement of Defence. Additionally, the condominiums were only days from being converted so that they could be sold, prior to which they were not available for sale, contrary to the allegations in the Statement of Defence.</P>
<P>7. The plaintiffs state that they were and are desirous of replacing the building and are only unable to do such due to the contractual breach and tortious actions of the defendant. Discussions were underway to replace the building until the defendant indicated its refusal to honour the policy.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>STATEMENT OF DEFENCE TO THE COUNTERCLAIM</UNDER></TI>
<P>8. The plaintiffs, defendants by Counterclaim, repeat all the allegations above.</P>
<P>9. The plaintiffs deny any wrongdoing by them and state they are entitled to the relief pleaded for in the Statement of Claim, and not liable to the Defendant, Plaintiff by Counterclaim, for any of the matters claimed by it.</P>
<P>10. The plaintiffs, defendant by Counterclaim, deny the entitlement, in any event, of those matters referred to in paragraph 15(b) through 15(f) as being remote and unnecessary.</P>
<P>11. The plaintiffs, defendant by Counterclaim, therefore submit that the Counterclaim he dismissed with costs on a solicitor and own client basis.</P>
