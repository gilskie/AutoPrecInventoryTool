<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P><BOLD>THIS IS AN APPLICATION</BOLD> for Judicial Review in respect of a second review decision dated July 31, 2017 issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) concluding that the applicant is not entitled to relief from interest or penalties under the taxpayer relief provisions of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.) (the &ldquo;<EM>ITA</EM>&rdquo;):</P>
<P>1. The applicant makes an application for:
<P1>(a) an Order that:
<P2>(i) the decision of the CRA dated July 31, 2017 (the &ldquo;Decision&rdquo;) be varied; and</P2>
<P2>(ii) the applicant's taxpayer relief request for full interest and penalty cancellation be granted in full;</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) the costs of this Application; and</P1>
<P1>(c) such further and other relief as may be required and this Honourable Court may deem just in the circumstances of this case.</P1></P>
<P>2. The grounds for the application are:
<P1>(a) the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 (&ldquo;<EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>&rdquo;), as amended, and in particular sections 18 and 18.1;</P1>
<P1>(b) the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.) (&ldquo;<EM>ITA</EM>&rdquo;) as amended, and in particular subsection 220(3.1);</P1>
<P1>(c) the CRA is a federal board, commission or other tribunal pursuant to the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(d) the Decision is a second review of the applicant's first request for taxpayer relief, which first request was denied in full by the CRA on December 5, 2014;</P1>
<P1>(e) The Decision considered whether the applicant's financial position and serious emotional and mental distress related to a death in his family and a divorce entitled him to cancellation of penalties and arrears interest relating to a payroll tax debt of Highmark Development Inc. (&ldquo;Highmark&rdquo;) incurred in or around the 2005 and 2006 taxation years for which the CRA alleged the applicant was personally liable in his capacity as a corporate director of Highmark during the material times;</P1>
<P1>(f) The Decision concluded that the applicant failed to demonstrate that his failure to remit Highmark's payroll tax was due to serious emotional and mental distress resulting from his divorce and a death in his family or that he had an inability to pay the ongoing outstanding payroll tax debt as a result of financial hardship. On this basis, the Decision further concluded that the applicant was not entitled to any relief from penalties or interest relating to the payroll tax debt under the taxpayer relief provisions of the <EM>ITA</EM>; and</P1>
<P1>(g) The applicant says that the Decision was unreasonable and in reaching the Decision, the CRA
<P2>(i) erred in law;</P2>
<P2>(ii) erred in its findings of fact;</P2>
<P2>(iii) fettered its discretion;</P2>
<P2>(iv) considered irrelevant factors andfailed to considerrelevant factors;</P2>
<P2>(v) relied on guidelines and policies that are contrary to law; and</P2>
<P2>(vi) committed a palpable andoverridingerror, reviewable by this Court;</P2></P1></P>
<P>3. This application will be supported by the following material:
<P1>(a) the record relating to the Decision (the &ldquo;Record&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) affidavit(s) to be filed; and</P1>
<P1>(c) such further and other documentary evidence as counsel may provide and this Honourable Court may allow.</P1></P>
<P>4. The applicant requests that the CRA send a certified copy of the following material that is not in the possession of the applicant but is in the possession of the CRA to the applicant and to the Registry pursuant to Rule 317 of the <EM>Federal Court Rules</EM>:
<P1>(a) the Record and all material relevant to this application.</P1></P>

The Applicant, Joseph Bifano (&ldquo;Bifano&rdquo;), brings this application for Judicial Review in respect of a second review decision issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;CRA&rdquo;). This decision denied Bifano's taxpayer relief request to cancel failure to file penalties and arrears interest relating to a Director's Liability assessed against Bifano as a director for Highmark Development Inc. (the &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo;) pursuant to subsection 227.1 of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (the &ldquo;ITA&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c 15<SUP>th</SUP> Supp [<EM>ITA</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and relating to the 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxation years of the Corporation.</P>
<P>2. The CRA concluded that Bifano's financial position did not amount to financial hardship or an inability to pay, and that Bifano's divorce from his wife and the death of his son did not create the circumstances which entitled him to any penalty or interest relief under the taxpayer relief program.</P>
<P>3. It is submitted that the decision to deny Bifano's request for relief in full is unreasonable on the basis that this decision is not defensible in respect of the facts and law and because the Minister improperly fettered her discretion.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>Statement of Facts</TI>
<P>4. The Corporation was incorporated on or about April 12, 2005, and a payroll account was created in or about June 2005. From the date of incorporation until March 30, 2007, Bifano was a director of the Corporation.</P>
<P>5. In or about December 2005, Bifano and his wife, Caroline Bifano, divorced.</P>
<P>6. Beginning in 2006, the Corporation began experiencing financial difficulties. Eventually, the Corporation went bankrupt, and on November 30, 2009, the Corporation was dissolved.</P>
<P>7. On or about March 20, 2008, a Director's Liability was assessed against Bifano pursuant to subsection 227.1 of the ITA in the amount of $275,787.73, for unpaid payroll remittances assessed against the Corporation for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxation years.</P>
<P>8. In or about May 2008, Bifano's son was suddenly and tragically killed in a farming accident.</P>
<P>9. On or about March 20, 2013, the CRA received a taxpayer relief request submitted by Bifano seeking the cancellation of failure to file penalties and arrears interest relating to the unpaid payroll remittances by the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;First Level Taxpayer Relief Request&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>First Level Taxpayer Relief Request, Applicant's Record, at 203.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The First Level Taxpayer Relief Request sought interest relief primarily on the grounds of financial hardship and inability to pay, and serious emotional and mental distress caused by his divorce from his wife, in 2005, and the death of his son, in 2008.</P>
<P>10. In response to the First Level Taxpayer Relief Request, Bifano received a decision letter from the CRA dated December 5, 2014, denying the First Level Taxpayer Relief Request in full.</P>
<P>11. On or about October 11, 2016, Bifano submitted a request for a second review of the First Level Taxpayer Relief Request (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request, Applicant's Record, at 209 [Second Request].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request sought interest relief on the same grounds as those stated above for the First Level Taxpayer Relief Request, however, further information concerning the grounds for relief was provided to the CRA.</P>
<P>12. In response to the Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request, Bifano received a decision letter from the CRA dated July 31, 2017 (the &ldquo;Letter&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request Decision Letter, Applicant's Record, at 11 [Letter].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> maintaining the denial of relief in full.

<P>13. Pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA, the Minister has the discretionary power to relieve taxpayers from penalties or interest otherwise payable under the ITA:
<QUOTE><P>The Minister may, on or before the day that is ten calendar years after the end of a taxation year of a taxpayer (or in the case of a partnership, a fiscal period of the partnership) or on application by the taxpayer or partnership on or before that day, <UNDER>waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest</UNDER> otherwise payable under this Act by the taxpayer or partnership in respect of that taxation year or fiscal period, and notwithstanding subsections 152(4) to (5), any assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made that is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>ITA</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 1, s 220(3.1) [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>14. Subsection 220(3.1) is part of the ITA's &ldquo;fairness provisions&rdquo;, which allow the CRA to administer the tax system more fairly. The purpose of this subsection is to permit the application of common sense when dealing with taxpayers who, because of personal misfortune or circumstances beyond their control, are unable to meet deadlines or comply with rules under the tax system.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Kaiser v Canada (Minister of National Revenue)</SOC><YEAR>1995</YEAR><CITE>95 DTC 5187</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>93 FTR 66</CITE><PARANUM>8</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [<EM>Kaiser</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. In order to assist administrative decision-makers who deal with taxpayers seeking relief pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA, the CRA created the Information Circular IC07-1, <EM>Taxpayer Relief Provisions</EM> (the &ldquo;IC07-1&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, Information Circular IC07-1: <EM>Taxpayer Relief Provisions</EM>, August 18, 2017 [IC07-1].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In addition to serving as an administrative guideline, this policy statement informs taxpayers on how to make a request for relief, including the proper information and documentation needed to support such a request.</P>
<P>16. It is well established in law, that a decision made pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA is discretionary in nature and that the applicable standard of review for such decisions is that of reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada Revenue Agency v Telfer</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 23</CITE><PARANUM>2</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>One:</N><TI>The Minister's decision to deny Bifano's Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request in full is not defensible in respect of the facts and law.</TI>
<P>17. As the Supreme Court of Canada explained in <CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC></CASEREF>,<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>47</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> a review into the reasonableness of a decision must inquire into the qualities that make that decision reasonable, referring to both the process of articulating the reasons and to the outcome. As the Court further elaborated:
<QUOTE><P>In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>18. Despite the general guidance that <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> injected into modem administrative law, the decision in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> does not provide specific guidance on how a court should go about applying the reasonableness standard.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Gus Van Harten et al., <EM>Administrative Law: Cases, Text, and Materials</EM>, 7<SUP>th</SUP> ed (Canada: Emond Montgomery Publications Limited) at 790.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Academics have commented that the analytical process for applying the reasonableness standard has at times appeared to have challenged the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at 791.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. In <CASEREF><SOC>Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador</SOC></CASEREF>, Justice Abella explained that the analysis into the reasonableness of a decision should be an organic exercise whereby &ldquo;the reasons must be read together with the outcome [in showing] whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board)</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 62</CITE><PARANUM>14</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Newfoundland Nurses</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. It is submitted that the CRA made two unreasonable errors. First, by only making cursory reference to the emotional and mental distress suffered by Bifano due to his divorce and due to the loss of his child, when these facts should have formed the basis of whether or not to grant taxpayer relief, and secondly in refusing to allow any kind of relief in light of the fact of the taxpayer's tremendous emotional and mental distress.</P>
<P>21. In the Letter, the CRA official stated that a divorce is difficult but does not explain how Bifano was prevented from making the required remittance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter, <EM>supra</EM> note 4, Applicant's Record, at 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, according to the CRA delegated official who prepared a certain fact sheet report dated July 21, 2017 (the &ldquo;Fact Sheet Report&rdquo;), &ldquo;while [a divorce] could be considered as beyond his control,...if he was able to open and run a business, he would have been capable of ensuring payroll was on time&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Review Taxpayer Relief Fact Sheet Report, Certified Copy of Requested Material, at 27, 28. [Fact Sheet Report].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There is no further acknowledgment of the potential impact the divorce may of had on Bifano throughout the Fact Sheet Report, despite the fact that the CRA official considered events that occurred after the divorce in 2005. This strongly suggests that the CRA did not reflect on the lasting emotional and mental distress that a divorce can have on an individual.</P>
<P>22. Similarly, with regard to the tragic loss of Bifano's son in 2008, the Fact Sheet Report and the Letter demonstrate that this event was viewed in a vacuum, separate from all other factors that the CRA considered. The Fact Sheet Report acknowledges the death of Bifano's child only twice. Once when it stated that Bifano's son's passing occurred after the taxes were due, and a second time when it stated that &ldquo;this is a very difficult situation&rdquo; but Bifano was aware that taxes were owed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, Certified Copy of Requested Material, at 28,30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The fact that the CRA did not grapple with the impact of the death of a child when reviewing events and factors that occurred after 2008, and that this tragedy was described merely as a &ldquo;difficult situation&rdquo; strongly exemplifies the perfunctory manner in which the CRA reviewed Bifano's request for relief.</P>
<P>24. The loss of a child is devastating. The impact of this loss on a parent is unimaginable, significant and lasting. The judiciary has stated that &ldquo;no parent can ever suffer a worse pain than the grief that comes with the loss of a child&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>R v N(M)</SOC><CITE>[2004] OJ No 5787</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2004 CarswellOnt 6256</CITE><PARANUM>2</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. Furthermore, there should be no need for parents to provide extensive proof to the CRA that they are distressed by the loss of their child and that this event will forever affect their lives. As stated by Justice L'Heureux-Dub&ea;:
<QUOTE><P><UNDER>It is not hard to understand</UNDER> that the death of one's own child is in all respects an extremely distressing, indeed even traumatizing, event. The suffering that accompanies this unnatural event has no equivalent in intensity aside from the immeasurable joy that can result from the birth of a child. Such suffering is so acute that it seems impossible even to assess it in monetary terms.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Augustus v Gosset</SOC><CITE>[1996] 3 SCR 268</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[1996] SCJ No 92</CITE><PARANUM>47</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>26. Returning to Justice Abella's judgment in <EM>Newfoundland Nurses</EM>, poorly articulated reasons are not in and of themselves determinative of an unreasonable decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Newfoundland Nurses</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 13 at para 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, looking at the outcome in conjunction with the reasons in an organic approach, it is clear that the CRA made an unreasonable decision in the present instance.</P>
<P>27. Additionally, although the Supreme Court of Canada has also said that a specialized tribunal should be afforded more deference, this is not an instant in which the CRA is interpreting a technical tax provision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 13.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This is a determination involving compassion and commonsense. What is the purpose of subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA if not to provide a bit of relief when a taxpayer has suffered such losses.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3 LABEL="Issue"><N>Two:</N><TI>In deciding to deny Bifano's Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request in full, the Minister fettered her discretion.</TI>
<P>28. It was recently re-articulated by this Court in 2016, that the Supreme Court of Canada did not address in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> where the issue of a decision maker fettering his discretion falls within the standard of review analysis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Ouedraogo v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</SOC><CITE>2016 FC 810</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, this Court has consistently applied Justice Stratas' view described in <CASEREF><SOC>Stemijon Investments Ltd v Canada</SOC></CASEREF> that, &ldquo;irrespective of the standard of review, the result will be the same if a decision resulted from a fettered discretion, it is per se unreasonable&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Stemijon Investments Ltd v Canada</SOC><CITE>2011 FCA 299</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Stemijon</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In other words, a fettering of discretion is always outside of the range of possible acceptable outcomes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 23&ndash;25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. As Justice Stratas indicates, automatically setting aside decisions in which discretion has been fettered properly upholds the rule of law:
<QUOTE><P>Decision-makers must follow the law. If the law gives them discretion of a certain scope, they cannot, in a binding way, cut down that scope. To allow that is to allow them to rewrite the law. Only Parliament or its validly authorized delegates can write or rewrite law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>30. In determining the scope of subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA, Justice D.R. Campbell stated in <CASEREF><SOC>Nixon v Minister of National Revenue</SOC></CASEREF> that, &ldquo;by s.220(3.1) of the Act, the Minister has authority to apply unfettered discretion to grant relief from the operation of s. 163(1) as well as other penalty provisions in the Act&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Nixon v Minister of National Revenue</SOC><CITE>2008 FC 917</CITE><PARANUM>3</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. It is submitted that in this instance, the CRA denied Bifano's request for relief in full because Bifano's claims for relief did not fit squarely within the scenarios established in the CRA guidelines, and more generally, because the claims did not meet rigid thresholds for relief established by the CRA. Therefore, the CRA fettered the unqualified discretion of the Minister provided by subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><UNDER>A.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>Bifano's claims for relief did not squarely fit within the Three Scenarios</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. As stated above, the IC07-1 serves as an administrative guideline for a CRA official when reviewing applications for relief made by taxpayers, and in making decisions regarding whether to grant relief pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA.</P>
<P>33. The IC07-1 is separated into five parts. Part II, titled &ldquo;<EM>Guidelines for the Cancellation or Waiver of Penalties and Interest</EM>&rdquo;, sets out three specific scenarios for when the Minister may grant relief: extraordinary circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, actions of the CRA, and an inability to pay or financial hardship (together, the &ldquo;Three Scenarios&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, <EM>supra</EM> note 7 at paras 23&ndash;28.2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Additionally, Part II sets out certain factors that a CRA official will consider when determining whether or not to cancel or waive penalties and interest.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. However, these guidelines are by no means exhaustive and by virtue of the scope of subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA, relief can still be granted where the taxpayer's circumstances do not fall within the CRA designated categories.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Spence v Canada Revenue Agency</SOC><CITE>2010 FC 52</CITE><PARANUM>13</PARANUM></CASEREF> [<EM>Spence</EM>].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, the CRA is not bound by the listed factors. As it was stated by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Spence v Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, &ldquo;the guidelines are helpful but do not impede [the subsection 220(3.1)] discretion. It is the delegated decision maker who must therefore make the final decision, not the guidelines.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para 31.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. In the Letter, a CRA official concluded that he was unable to find that Bifano was prevented from complying with his tax obligation due to financial hardship or an inability to pay; one of the Three Scenarios. As the CRA official explained in the Letter, &ldquo;the CRA views financial hardship as the prolonged inability to provide necessaries such as food, clothing, shelter and reasonable non-essentials.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter, <EM>supra</EM> note 4, Applicant's Record, at 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. This is a restrictive view of what constitutes financial hardship or an inability to pay warranting taxpayer relief that is grounded in the guidelines rather than in law. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gandy v Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court stated as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The fact that Ms. Gandy was able to borrow money, thanks perhaps to a rising real estate market, does not lead to the conclusion that she suffered no financial hardship. The definition of &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; in the Oxford English dictionary includes &ldquo;a condition which presses unusually hard upon one who has to endure it&rdquo;. Hardship is not the equivalent of impossibility.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gandy v Canada (Canada Customs and Revenue Agency)</SOC><CITE>2006 FC 862</CITE><PARANUM>27</PARANUM></CASEREF> [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>37. The above noted passage from the Letter suggests that unless Bifano could prove that his circumstances amounted to the CRA's definition for financial hardship, he would not qualify for relief. Therefore, the CRA official grounded his reasons for denial in a concept that stems primarily from the IC07-1 rather than subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA.</P>
<P>38. Moreover, the Government of Canada has stated that each request must be reviewed and decided on its own merits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, <EM>supra</EM> note 7 at para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In fact, in <EM>Spence</EM>, this Court found that the guidelines include many provisions encouraging CRA officials to remain flexible in deciding a particular. In the abovementioned case, the applicant's request did not fall within one of the Three Scenario, and yet this Court even went so far as to state that &ldquo;even if the guidelines were elevated to the status of binding law, they would provide for the possibility of relief in the applicant's situation.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spence</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 28 at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. The decision in <EM>Spence</EM> also indicates that CRA officials cannot passively rely on the examples provided in the guidelines for whether an applicant's circumstances fit within one of the Three Scenarios. Instead, CRA officials have a duty to probe further to determine if relief should be permitted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at paras 28&ndash;30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. In the present instance, there was no flexibility afforded to Bifano, and the CRA officials did not probe further to determine if relief should be permitted. The Letter and the Fact Sheet Report suggest that the taxpayer's divorce and loss of a child did not cross a &ldquo;distress threshold&rdquo; that exists at the CRA such that a request can qualify under the &ldquo;Extraordinary Circumstances&rdquo; scenario. In both the Letter and the Fact Sheet Report, as stated above, the CRA quickly concluded that a divorce cannot be truly distressing when the taxpayer opens a business in the same year.</P>
<P>41. With regard to the loss of his child, both the Letter and the Fact Sheet Report make a point of stating that since the child died after the payroll remittances were due, Bifano was not prevented from complying with the ITA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Fact Sheet Report, <EM>supra</EM> note 15, Certified Copy of Requested Material, at 28,30; Letter, <EM>supra</EM> note 4, Applicant's Record, at 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Not only are these comments perfunctory, as stated above, but they imply that for events to qualify under the CRA &ldquo;Extraordinary Circumstances&rdquo; scenario, they must occur at a particular point in time.</P>
<P>42. No further analysis was provided by either the CRA official who drafted the Decision, nor the CRA official who drafted the Fact Sheet Report, for whether exceptional circumstances in Bifano's case were present despite the fact that the Second Level Taxpayer Relief Request stated that &ldquo;these event led to the taxpayer experiencing serious emotional and mental distress during the period in which the director's liability was assessed ..... [and] the taxpayer continues to be affected to this day by these horrific and unfortunate events&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Second Request, <EM>supra</EM> note 3, Applicant's Record, at 215.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. Moreover, a fair reading of the Letter as well as the Fact Sheet Report does not provide any explanation for why Bifano's claims of financial hardship and emotional and mental distress though falling short of fitting within the Three Scenarios, still did not warrant any relief.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><UNDER>B.</UNDER></N><TI><UNDER>The Minister fettered his discretion by establishing a threshold for receiving any relief</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. In <EM>Spence</EM>, it was determined by this Court that a ministerial representative's choice of words found within the decision letter sufficiently evidenced that the ministerial representative operated under an opinion that the CRA policies were binding.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Spence</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 28 at paras 22, 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. In the Letter, the CRA official stated that &ldquo;when considering a request for relief, <BOLD><UNDER>it must be clear</UNDER></BOLD> that the circumstances presented <BOLD><UNDER>prevented</UNDER></BOLD> [the taxpayer] <BOLD><UNDER>from compliance</UNDER></BOLD>&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter, <EM>supra</EM> note 4, Applicant's Record, at 12 [emphasis added].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, there is nothing within subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA that suggests that relief is restricted to instances where the taxpayer is prevented from complying. In fact, the broad discretion within this subsection suggest that relief ma y be given under circumstances that do not amount to prevention. Arguably, because subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA permits the Minister to relieve penalties and interest in full, or in <EM>any</EM> proportion, subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA was intended to permit relief even in circumstances where the taxpayer's ability to comply was hindered or affected in some manner.</P>
<P>46. Analogously to <EM>Spence</EM>, it is submitted that the words &ldquo;it must be clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;prevented from compliance&rdquo; strongly suggest that the CRA official was under the opinion that his discretion was somehow restricted.</P>
<P>47. The interpretation of subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA, that relief may still be awarded to a taxpayer when the circumstances do not amount to prevention, remains consistent with the wide bestowment of discretion by Parliament, the flexibility required by this Court in <EM>Spence</EM> and the purpose of this subsection. As described by Justice Rouleau in <CASEREF><SOC>Kaiser v Canada</SOC></CASEREF>, the purpose of this subsection is &ldquo;to administer the tax system more fairly, by allowing for the application of common sense&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Kaiser</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 6 at para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It is submitted, that Justice Rouleau did not intend that the application of common sense be restricted to situations where there was clear prevention, but instead, that decision makers are to use their judgment under all circumstances.</P>
<P>48. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the Minister restricted her discretion to the Three Scenarios or to the CRA's thresholds rather than looking to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA in deciding to deny Bifano's relief in full. This is exactly the type of fettering that the Federal Court of Appeal disapproved of in <EM>Stemijon</EM>.</P>
<P>49. Perhaps it could be argued that in the present case, unlike in <EM>Stemijon</EM>, the CRA included in the Letter an introductory paragraph acknowledging that subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA is the source of the Minister's power, and that the Minister may grant relief requests which do not fall within the Three Scenarios. Similarly, this subsection was acknowledged by the CRA official who wrote the Fact Sheet Report.</P>
<P>50. Nonetheless, the CRA should not be permitted to merely state that the decision is discretionary when <EM>in fact</EM> discretion is not being properly exercised. In <EM>Stemijon</EM>, Justice Stratas' analysis goes beyond whether or not the Minister acknowledges his or her discretion or whether certain references to the ITA were made. Instead, Justice Stratas is concerned with whether or not there was <EM>de facto</EM> discretion based on the facts.</P>
<P>51. Therefore, we would urge this Court not to find that it is sufficient for the Minister to acknowledge the source of her power and discretion in the Letter and Fact Sheet Report, while <EM>de facto</EM> restricting this discretion. To do so, will circumvent the rule of law.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>52. For the aforementioned reasons, Bifano seeks an Order varying the decision to deny relief in full and directing the Minister to cancel all failure to file penalties and arrears interest relating to the Directors Liability assessment for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxation years of the Corporation.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>RESPONDENT'S MEMORANDUM OF FACT AND LAW</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Minister of National Revenue in response to his request for taxpayer relief. The Minister exercised discretion not to grant the applicant additional relief.</P>
<P>2. The applicant is a businessman who participated in a series of transactions designed to avoid tax by selling his corporation, transferring shares of other corporations to members of his family, and having all assets held in other corporations' names. He has structured his finances so that nothing is in his name.</P>
<P>3. In 2008, the Minister issued a director's liability assessment against the applicant for Highmark Developments Inc. for $275,787.73, on the basis that he was liable for unpaid payroll remittances of the corporation related to the corporation's 2006 tax year. The amount assessed includes penalties for failure to remit on the missed remittances along with the principal amounts of the missed remittances and arrears interest.</P>
<P>4. The applicant applied for relief from penalties and interest. His request was denied. The Minister concluded that the applicant did not demonstrate that he was prevented from complying with his tax obligations. The request was otherwise denied as there were no circumstances to justify the exercise of the Minister's discretion to grant relief.</P>
<P>5. The Minister's decision was reasonable and there is no basis upon which this court should intervene.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART I&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>6. The applicant is a businessman and is associated with eleven Canadian corporations. Through his corporations he is involved various farming operations<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, pages 3&ndash;5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P>
<P>7. By letter received on October 1, 2012 the applicant submitted a request for taxpayer relief to the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) requesting relief of penalties and interest pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> in relation to the director's liability assessment was made that was made against the applicant as director of the corporation, Highmark Development Inc., on the basis of medical/emotional distress and financial hardship.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. In response to the initial request, the Minister declined to grant relief to the applicant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. By letter received on October 12, 2016, the applicant requested a second review of his taxpayer relief request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. The decision in response to the applicant's request for a second review of his taxpayer relief request was issued by Mona Khanifar, Tax Payer Relief Team Leader in the Appeals Division of the Vancouver Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency, as a delegated representative of the Minister of National Revenue for the purposes of subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>. The decision was communicated to the applicant by letter dated July 31, 2017 and is the decision that is the subject of review in the within application.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART II&mdash;POINT IN ISSUE</TI>
<P>11. The issue in this application is whether the Minister's decision is reasonable.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART III&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Minister's decision is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness</TI>
<P>12. The decision under review is a discretionary decision made under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp), section 220(3.1). [Respondent's Record, Appendix A, Tab 1]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The well-settled standard of review with respect to decisions under subsection 220(3.1) is that of reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada Revenue Agency v Telfer</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 23</CITE></CASEREF> [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 12], and <CASEREF><SOC>Lanno v Canada (Customs and Revenue Agency)</SOC><CITE>2005 FCA 153</CITE></CASEREF>. [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 9]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. The standard of reasonableness was described in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> as being &ldquo;concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process.&rdquo; It is a deferential standard that examines &ldquo;whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM>, para 47 [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 9]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. On judicial review, the court &ldquo;cannot substitute [its] own appreciation of the appropriate solution.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa</SOC><CITE>2009 SCC 12</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2009] 1 SCR 339</CITE><PARANUM>59</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>. [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 5]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Rather, it must determine whether the Minister's decision fell within the range of acceptable solutions.</P>
<P>15. The Minister's findings of fact are entitled to a high degree of deference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Khosa</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 9 at para 46. [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 5]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The appropriate level of deference requires &ldquo;a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of a decision&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board)</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 62</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>[2011] 3 SCR 708</CITE><PARANUM>12</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>. [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 10]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI>The Minister's decision falls within the range of reasonable outcomes</TI>
<P>16. The Minister's decision was reasonable in light of the information put before her.</P>
<P>17. Subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985 c.1, (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp) as amended, section 230(3.1). [Respondent's Record, Appendix A, Tab 1]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> gives the Minister broad discretion to waive or cancel penalties and interest otherwise payable under the Act. The Canada Revenue Agency has developed administrative guidelines to inform the exercise of this discretion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Information Circular IC07, Canada Revenue Agency [Respondent's Record, Appendix A, Tab 3]</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. Cancellation of interest may be justified where a taxpayer has been unable to deal with their obligations due to delays on the part of the Minister, extraordinary circumstances, or financial hardship.</P>
<P>19. The decision maker considered each of the grounds cited in support of the applicant's request for relief. The Minister also considered the factual findings that led her to decide not to grant additional relief.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. The applicant claims he was experiencing financial and emotional hardship on the one hand, and then made several promises to pay the debt in full on the other, including in 2007.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, pages 2-3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Nothing prevented the applicant from voluntarily addressing the payroll remittances on time, or addressing the assessment balance in a timely manner.</P>
<P>21. Extraordinary circumstances are situations beyond a taxpayer's control which may have prevented them from making a payment (or otherwise fulfilling an obligation) when due. Examples of extraordinary circumstances include natural disasters, civil disturbances, serious illness or accident, and serious mental or emotional distress. They are situations where it was not possible for the taxpayer to conduct their affairs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cooke v R</SOC><CITE>2009 FC 1161</CITE><PARANUM>18 and 20</PARANUM></CASEREF> [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 7].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. The Minister's finding on this point is well within the range of acceptable outcomes and should stand.</P>
<P>23. The Minister reviewed the applicant's representations and reasonably concluded that there were no grounds for interest relief outside of the grounds named in the guidelines. His conduct did not merit it. The applicant had a history of not paying large amounts owing to the Minister as required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He knowingly allowed interest to accrue on his debt in spite of letters advising same from Canada Revenue Agency.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2, page 5.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He did not take care in the conduct of his affairs and, indeed, was engaged in a pattern of behavior designed to frustrate the Canada Revenue Agency by promising to pay in full and transferring assets to his family members.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Tribunal Record, Rule 317 certificate, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> He did not make a voluntary payment on his debt for ten years, and avoided addressing his obligation for the 2006 taxation year.</P>
<P>24. The applicant also seeks substantive relief from this court. This relief is not available to the applicant. As confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Canada Revenue Agency v Slau Limited</SOC></CASEREF>, subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> &ldquo;simply requires the Minister to exercise the discretion that is provided thereunder and does not require the Minister to bring about any particular result.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Canada Revenue Agency v Slau</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 270</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2009 DTC 5167</CITE></CORRELAT><CORRELAT><CITE>[2010] 1 CTC 15</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> [Respondent's Record, Appendix B, Tab 11].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. The Minister considered all of the material and issued a reasonable decision in light of all the facts presented. That decision should be upheld.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
