<P>PROPOSED METHOD OF HEARING:
<P1>The motion is to be heard orally.</P1></P>
<P>THE MOTION IS FOR
<P1>a) An Order abridging the time permitting the hearing of the motion on short notice to the Defendant, if necessary;</P1>
<P1>b) An Order abridging the time for filing the motion materials, if required;</P1>
<P1>c) An Order setting aside the Plaintiffs Default Judgment against the Defendant, Lois Virgo;</P1>
<P1>d) An Order directing the forthwith withdrawal of the Plaintiff's Writ of Execution and Garnishment against the Defendant Lois Virgo;</P1>
<P1>e) An Order directing the repayment of any funds received by the Plaintiff and or the Office of the Court Accountant to the Defendant herein on account of this action ;</P1>
<P1>f) Costs of this motion on a substantial indemnity basis; and</P1>
<P1>g) Such further and other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem just.</P1></P>
<P>THE GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION ARE
<P1>a) The Plaintiff commenced this action on or about May 15, 2009 and obtained default judgment against all the Defendants on or about September 2009;</P1>
<P1>b) The Plaintiff filed a Writ of Execution against all the Defendants on or about September 2009;</P1>
<P1>c) The Defendant Lois Virgo, the Moving Party herein (&ldquo;Ms. Virgo&rdquo;) is the former spouse of the Defendant Jeremy Renato Virgo (&ldquo;Mr. Virgo&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>d) On or about September 2008 and approximately nine (9) months before the Plaintiff commenced its action, the Virgos separated, Ms Virgo moved from the motrimonial home and she and her son moved into rental premises</P1>
<P1>e) Since separating from Mr. Virgo, Ms Virgo has had little, if any contact or communication with Mr. Virgo;</P1>
<P1>f) In 2012, Ms Virgo petitioned for divorce. Mr. Virgo failed to file a response, and to attend any of the divorce proceedings;</P1>
<P1>g) On July 4, 2014, Ms Virgo purchased a home for she and her son;</P1>
<P1>h) The existence of the Plaintiff's Writ of Execution, its Judgment, and this action first became known to Ms Virgo during the last week of May 2014 as a result of various searches conducted in respect of her pending house purchase;</P1>
<P1>i) Ms Virgo was neither an officer, director, shareholder nor a participant (active or otherwise) in any of the Defendant companies/enterprises, nor in the financial affairs of Mr. Virgo, before or during their marriage.</P1>
<P1>j) She does recall signing a series of Bank of Nova Scotia loan documents sent to her by Mr. Virgo in 2005 while she was on a business trip to Jamaica, but the particulars of the documents and the event itself are vague given that more than a decade has passed.</P1>
<P1>k) In June 2014, the counsel herein failed to reach an agreement as to the setting aside of the Default Judgment against and the Writ of Execution filed against Ms. Virgo, counsel for Ms Virgo served its Notice of Motion (on a urgent basis) and Motion Record upon counsel for the Plaintiff and arranged for the filing of the motion materials.
<P2>(Counsel for Ms Virgo intends, to rely upon the documentary evidence contained in the Motion Record served upon the Plantiff's Counsel in June of 2014)</P2></P1>
<P1>l) After confirming receipt of the said motion materials, counsel for the Plaintiff consented to the withdrawal of the Writ of Execution against Ms Virgo in order to permit her pending house purchase to close;</P1>
<P1>m) The matter of the Default Judgment against Ms Virgo, the sufficiency of service upon her and her liability to the Plaintiff, if any at all, were deferred for further negation;</P1>
<P1>n) Subsequent discussions between counsel failed to resolve the outstanding issues and on or about November 8, 2016, the Plaintiff served a Notice of Garnishment upon Ms Virgo's employer;</P1>
<P1>o) On December 13, 2016, the Plaintiff's counsel was served with a Notice of Return of Motion which erroneously indicated that the motion would be heard on Friday, December 24, 2016. December 24, 2016 was in fact a Saturday;</P1>
<P1>p) After further fruitless settlement discussions, on December 23, 2016, counsel for the Plaintiff was again served with an amended Notice of Return of Motion to set aside and stay enforcement of the Plaintiff's Default Judgment. The amended Notice of Motion indicated that the returnable date was January 12, 2017;</P1>
<P1>q) On or about January 10, 2017, counsel for Ms Virgo became aware of the fact that the initial (June 2014) Motion materials to set aside and stay enforcement of the Plaintiff's Default Judgment, had not filed with the Court on account of the fact that word that the Plaintiff's counsel had consented to adjourn the subject motion and withdraw the Writ of Execution against Ms Virgo was conveyed to the process server before he had actually filed the motion materials but after he had collected them for filing;</P1>
<P1>m) Serious issues exists as to:
<P2>i. whether or not Ms Virgo had knowledge of the Plaintiff's claim prior to May, 2014;</P2>
<P2>ii. whether or not Ms Virgo was properly served with notice of the Plaintiff's action;</P2>
<P2>iii. the capacity under which Ms Virgo was named a Defendant, be it as co-applicant, an officer and/or director, a personal guarantor, or a consenting spouse, as well as to what extent, if at all, she is liable to the Plaintiff; and additionally</P2>
<P2>iv. whether or not she was entitled to independent legal advice prior to agreeing to act as a guarantor of the corporate and personal loans made by the Plaintiff to Mr. Virgo and his companies, and if so,</P2>
<P2>v) whether or not she received independent legal advice;</P2></P1>
<P1>n) The Defendant, Lois Virgo will rely on Rules 1.04 (1), 2.01(a), 2.03, 3.02(1), and (2), 16.07 and 19.08 of the Rules <UNDER>of Civil Procedure</UNDER>; and</P1>
<P1>o) Such further and other grounds as counsel for the Moving Party Defendant may advise.</P1></P>
<P>THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE will be used at the hearing of the motion:
<P1>a) The Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn June 28, 2014</P1>
<P1>b) The Affidavit of Fatima Melo, sworn June 30, 2014</P1>
<P1>c) Such further and other evidence counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>

<P>I, Fatima Melo, of the City of Mississauga, in the Regional Municipality of Peel, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a law clerk in the employ of Bodkin Law, counsel for the Defendant, Lois Virgo, and as such, I have knowledge of the matters contained herein this my Affidavit.</P>
<P>2. In the course of my duties as Mr. Bodkin's senior real estate law clerk, I conducted a series of searches in respect of Ms Virgo's pending real property purchase which is scheduled to close on July 4, 2014.</P>
<P>3. My search for writs of executions against Ms Virgo's name revealed the Plaintiff's Writ of Execution, File Number 09-5436, filed with the Brampton Sheriff on September 10, 2009. Attached hereto this my Affidavit and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the said Writ Details Report.</P>
<P>4. At the direction of Mr. Bodkin, I forwarded an email to counsel for the Judgment Creditor in this matter, requesting:
<P1>(i) copies of documents pertaining the Plaintiff's action given that Ms Virgo had no knowledge of the action and, at best, a vague recollection of certain events possibly related to the underlying transaction; and</P1>
<P1>(ii) opposing counsel's co-operation in facilitating the completion of Ms Virgo's pending real estate transaction, and in possibly resolving the Plaintiff's action in an efficient and just manner.</P1></P>
<P>5. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> of this my Affidavit is a copy of Mr. Bodkin's email to opposing counsel which I forwarded on June 25, 2014.</P>
<P>6. Later the same day, I received opposing counsel's response in our firm's general email box denying Mr. Bodkin's request for documents and assistance in resolving the matter cooperatively.</P>
<P>7. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> of this my Affidavit is a copy of opposing counsel's response thereby necessitating the hearing of this matter on an urgent basis.</P>
<P>8. I make the Affidavit in support of a motion to set aside the Plaintiff's Default Judgment as against Lois Virgo; to stay enforcement of the said Judgment as against Lois Virgo, to withdraw the Writ of Execution filed against Lois Virgo, and for the costs of the motion and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>AFFIDAVIT of LOIS VIRGO</UNDER></TI>
<P>I, Lois Virgo, of the City of Mississauga, in the Regional Municipality of Peel, in the Province of Ontario, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am the former spouse of Jeremy Renato Neil Virgo, also known as Jeremy Virgo (hereafter &ldquo;Mr. Virgo&rdquo;), a Co-Defendant in this action. We were married on January 1, 2000 in Kingston, Jamaica.</P>
<P>2. Mr. Virgo was the owner, operator and directing mind of the other Co-Defendants in this action, Renatoneil Consultants Ltd. and Wave Zone.</P>
<P>3. I was never included in, had any knowledge of, or was ever involved in any of Mr. Virgo's various business ventures and affairs. In fact, I now know that I was purposefully excluded from his business affairs. Furthermore, during our marriage we maintained largely separate lives and finances.</P>
<P>4. I have never been an officer, director or shareholder in Renatoneil Consultants Ltd. (hereafter &ldquo;Renatoneil&rdquo;), nor have I ever had any role whatsoever in the management or the affairs of Renatoneil.</P>
<P>5. I have never been an owner, partner nor investor in Wave Zone, nor have I ever had any role whatsoever in the management or the affairs of Wave Zone.</P>
<P>6. Notwithstanding my non-involvement of in either Renatoneil and Wave Zone, I recall that while visiting my parents in Jamaica, in late January 2005, I received an urgent call from Mr. Virgo advising me that he had arranged bank financing for one of his businesses, everything had been approved but the Bank of Nova Scotia required my signature on a couple of documents since I was his spouse.</P>
<P>7. Either the next day or the day after, Mr. Virgo sent certain documents pertaining to a Bank of Nova Scotia business loan which is the subject of this action to me in Jamaica and arranged for me to attend at a lawyer to have them witnessed.</P>
<P>8. I was advised by Mr. Virgo, and verily do believe, that my signature was all that was need for the loan to be processed, that he required the funds in order to take care of some long standing and urgent matters, and that upon the Bank receiving the said signed documents, funds would be released to him.</P>
<P>9. Whether or not this was actually the case I do not know, I only know what I was advised Mr. Virgo in our long distance telephone conversation.</P>
<P>10. At his request, I attended a lawyer's office in Kingston, Jamaica. The lawyer with whom I met was named Yolande Whitely.</P>
<P>11. Ms Whitely, briefly reviewed the document which Mr. Virgo sent to me with me, witnessed my signature on the said document and in approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after arriving at her office, I departed her office and couriered the signed documents back to Mr. Virgo in Toronto.</P>
<P>12. As I had no involvement in the affairs of Renatoneil nor Wave Zone, I was not privy as to how the loan was obtained, its terms, nor the manner in which the loan was serviced by Mr. Virgo, Renatoneil and/or Wave Zone.</P>
<P>13. Additionally, I certainly did not receive any portion of the advance from the said business loan from the Plaintiff, Mr. Virgo, Renatoneil nor Wave Zone.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Separation and Divorce</TI>
<P>14. In September, 2008, Mr. Virgo and I had become irreconcilably estranged, when I learned that he had conceived a child with his business partner and that the child was then two years old. I moved from the matrimonial home and since that time, Mr. Virgo and I have had little, if any, contact.</P>
<P>15. I filed for divorce in December 2011, and at that time I had no idea nor the slightest notion that I was saddled with Mr. Virgo's Bank of Nova Scotia business loan (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;), moreover that the Plaintiff in these proceedings had obtained default judgment against me in 2009.</P>
<P>16. Consequently, when I filed for divorce, neither the Plaintiff's loan nor its Default Judgment were addressed in my Net Family Property Statement, my Petition for Divorce, or in my Divorce Order, notwithstanding my profound hurt and disappointment and my desire to ensure that I did all that I possibly could do to make a fresh start for myself and our son.</P>
<P>17. My petition for Divorce was granted on May 15, 2012. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the my Divorce Order.</P>
<P>18. On May 18, 2014, I entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale for a townhome for my son and me. This transaction is scheduled to close on July 4, 2014.</P>
<P>19. On or about May 23, 2014, I received a telephone message Mr. Bodkin's real estate clerk, that an execution search revealed an Execution in favour of the Plaintiff against me.</P>
<P>20. Believing that the subject execution was a mistake given the zeal with which I manage my credit, or that it pertained to a Bank of Nova Scotia car loan which I paid in full in January 2013, I contacted my branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia which confirmed that my car loan had in fact been paid off and that they had no idea what gave rise to the execution.</P>
<P>21. Further investigation revealed that the Plainitiff's execution against me pertained to the Plaintiff's 2004 business loan to Mr. Virgo guaranteed by me in Jamaica in February 2005 an urgent basis for Mr. Virgo.</P>
<P>22. I am advised and verily do believe that as early as June 25, 2014, shortly after I first became aware the Plaintiff's action, its default judgment and execution against me, the Plaintiff was made aware of the following facts:
<P1><EM>a)</EM> my non-involvement in and lack of knowledge with respect to the affairs of Renatoneil, Wave Zone and Mr. Virgo's related business affairs, and</P1>
<P1><EM>b)</EM> the apparent irregularities and uncertainties with respect to the independent legal advice rendered to me on behalf of the Plaintiff and upon which it continues to rely.</P1>
<P1>Attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; is an email addressed to the counsel for the Plaintiff advising the Plaintiff accordingly.</P1></P>
<P>23. I make the Affidavit in support of the dismissal of the Motion for summary judgement against me and for no other or improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>RESPONDING PARTY'S FACTUM</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Respondent, Lois Virgo, (&ldquo;Ms Virgo&rdquo;) opposes the Applicant's Motion for Summary Judgment against her for the sum of $12,087.05, together with pre-judgment and post-judgment interest from April 9, 2009, the date on which the Plaintiff obtained Default Judgment against, <EM>inter alia</EM>, Ms Virgo, as a personal guarantor of the Plaintiff's business loan to Renatoneil Consultants Ltd., (&ldquo;Renatoneil&rdquo;) a company owned and operated by Ms Virgo's former spouse, Jeremy Virgo (&ldquo;Mr. Virgo&rdquo;) the sole owner, operator and directing mind of the said company.</P>
<P>2. Pursuant to the <EM>Canadian Small Business Financing Act</EM>, S.C. 1998, c.36, the Plaintiff, entered into a Credit Agreement for Business (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;) with Renatoneil on November 29, 2004.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Motion Record, Tab B, at paragraphs 5a, 6 and 7.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>3. The Plaintiff obtained Default Judgment against the Defendants in September, 2009.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraph 15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>4. In May 2014, Ms Virgo learned of the existence of the Plaintiff's Claim, Default Judgment and its Writ of Execution (the &ldquo;Writ&rdquo;) against her when she attempted to purchase a home for herself and her son.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraph 15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>5. Negotiations between counsel herein regarding the withdrawal of the Writ in order for Ms Virgo's then pending purchase to close in early July 2014 and the setting aside of Default Judgment against her remained at an impasse until late June 2014, when counsel for Ms Virgo was forced to serve motion materials for the setting aside of the Plaintiff's Default Judgment and withdrawal of its Writ.</P>
<P>6. Only upon being served, did the Plaintiff consent to withdraw and re-register its Writ thereby enabling Ms Virgo's purchase to be completed.</P>
<P>7. The Plaintiff persistently litigated this matter, including the issue of service notwithstanding the fact that it learned that Ms Virgo moved from the matrimonial home approximately nine month before the Plaintiff's action was commenced, and the Plaintiff knew that Ms. Virgo was served with notice of the subject claim at the corporate offices of Renatoneil even though it knew that Ms Virgo was not an officer, director or in any way involved with the business activities of the co-defendants.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 4 and 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. The Plaintiff also continues to litigate enforcement of the Guarantee notwithstanding it is aware of the circumstances underlying the Guarantee and the hardship this litigation is inflicting upon Ms Virgo and her son.</P>
<P>9. Only the issue of Ms Virgo's liability, if any, pursuant the Guarantee remains to be determined; and while in the first instance the signed Guarantee may appear determinative, genuine issues pertaining to the adequacy, sufficiency and independence of the legal advice provided to Ms Virgo in respect of the Guarantee exists and require a trial.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 6&ndash;11</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUMMARY OF FACTS</TI>
<P>10. Ms Virgo has never been an officer, director, shareholder or a participant (active or otherwise) in the Company, any of Mr. Virgo's business enterprises, or Mr. Virgo's financial Affairs, before or during their marriage.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 4 and 5</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. On November 29, 2004, Mr. Virgo and the Plaintiff entered into a Credit Agreement for Business, pursuant to the <EM>Canadian Small Business Financing Act</EM>, <UNDER>S.C</UNDER>. 1998, c.36.</P>
<P>12. In late January 2005, Mr. Virgo contacted Ms Virgo while she was overseas visiting her parents and advised her that the Plaintiff required her signature as his spouse on a business loan document and it was imperative that she tend to this matter as soon as she received the document which he would send to her.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraph 6</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>13. To this end, Mr. Virgo couriered the Plaintiff's Guarantee of a Term Loan for Business form (the &ldquo;Guarantee&rdquo;) to Ms Virgo, arranged for her meet with a lawyer in Jamaica that week and instructed Ms Virgo to courier the signed document back to him immediately after it had been executed.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 7&ndash;11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>14. Ms Virgo reviewed the document on her own when it was received, and on February 2, 2005 she met with a lawyer in Jamaica, Yolande J. Whitely, (&ldquo;Whitely&rdquo;) who briefly reviewed it with her and witnessed Ms Virgo's execution of the Guarantee.</P>
<P>15. Neither the actual loan agreement, a summary of its terms, the security documentation nor the loan commitment were provided to Ms Virgo.</P>
<P>16. Whitely made no mention of the profound legal impact of the Guarantee, nor the significance of its consequences, and she did not indicate that it would be in Ms Virgo's best interest to seek modification of the Guarantee.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraph 11</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>17. Whitely was not then, is not now, nor has she ever been a member of member of the Ontario Bar or a Licencee as defined by the <EM>Law Society Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c L.8
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraph 10</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Section 12 of the Guarantee provides that:
<QUOTE><P>All debts and liabilities, present and future, of the Customer to the Guarantor are hereby assigned to the Bank and postponed to the guaranteed liabilities, and all moneys received by the Guarantor in respect thereof shall be received in trust for the Bank and forthwith upon receipt shall be paid over to the Bank, the whole without in any way lessening or limiting the liability of the Guarantor under this guarantee; and this assignment and postponement is independent of the guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until repayment in full to the Bank of all the guaranteed liabilities, notwithstanding that the liability of the undersigned or any of them under this guarantee may have been discharged or terminated.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Motion Record, Tab 2, section 12.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Section 13 of the Guarantee provides that:
<QUOTE><P>The undersigned or any of them, if more than one, or his or their executors or administrators, by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the branch of the Bank at which the main account of the Customer is kept, may terminate his or their further liability under this guarantee in respect of liabilities of the Customer incurred or arising after the expiration of such thirty days, but not in respect of any guaranteed liabilities incurred or arising before the expiration of such thirty days even though not then matured; provided that notwithstanding receipt of any such notice the Bank may fulfil any requirements of the Customers based on agreements express or implied made prior to the expiration of such thirty days and any resulting liabilities shall be covered by this guarantee; and provide further that in the event of the termination of this guarantee as to one or more of the undersigned, if more than one, it shall remain a continuing guarantee as to the other or others of the undersigned.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Motion Record, Tab 2, section 13.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>20. Section 15 of the Guarantee provides that:
<QUOTE><P>This guarantee shall be governed in all respects by the law of the province in which the Customer's main account with the Bank is kept.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Motion Record, Tab 2, section 15.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>21. The meaning, legal significance, operation nor consequences of the sections 12 and 13 in particular, as well as other sections in the Guarantee, were not specifically addressed in Whitely's approximately 15 minute meeting with Ms Virgo. Consequently, the Guarantee itself, was not recalled by Ms Virgo when she initiated divorce proceedings against Mr. Virgo.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9uly, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 11 and 16</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>22. In September 2008, upon learning that Mr. Virgo had a two year old child with his business partner, Ms Virgo and her son moved from the matrimonial home and in December 2011 she petitioned for divorce.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs 14 and 15</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>23. Neither Ms Virgo's Net Family Property Statement or her Divorce Order make any mention of, nor do they take into account, any indebtedness incurred by Ms Virgo on behalf of Mr. Virgo, the Company and, in particular, pursuant to the Guarantee.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Affidavit of Lois Virgo, sworn August 9, 2017, Responding Record, Tab A, paragraphs Tab 1</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;THE LAW</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI>Summary Judgment</TI>
<P>24. The court shall grant a motion for summary judgment if, the court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence.
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended R. 20.04(2)(a)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>25. In determining under clause (2)(a) whether there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, the court shall consider the evidence submitted by the parties and, if the determination is being made by a judge, the judge may exercise any of the following powers for the purpose, unless it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercised at a trial:
<P1>1. Weighing the evidence.</P1>
<P1>2. Evaluating the credibility of a deponent.</P1>
<P1>3. Drawing any reasonable inference from the evidence.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference: Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended R. 20.04(2.1)</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>26. A two stage approach for determining if a genuine issue requiring a trial exists was set forth in <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Maulding</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>A judge on a summary judgment motion should:
<P1>i) Determine if there's a genuine issue requiring trial based only on the evidence before her, without using the new fact-finding powers. There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial if the summary judgment process provides her with the evidence required to fairly and justly adjudicate the dispute and it's a timely, affordable and proportionate procedure, under Rule 20.04(2)(a)</P1>
<P1>ii) If there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, the judge should then determine if the need for a trial can be avoided by using the new powers under Rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2)</P1>
<P1><BOLD>Reference:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Hryniak v. Maul ding</SOC><CITE>2014 SCC 7</CITE></CASEREF>, <BOLD><EM>[Hryniak]</EM> at para.66.</BOLD></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Genuine Issues Requiring a Trial Exist Regarding the Nature, Scope and Quality of the Legal Advice Given to Ms Virgo</TI>
<P>27. Where a creditor relies upon a spousal guarantee and has knowledge or out to have knowledge of irregularities and/or uncertainties in respect of the independent legal advice rendered, the creditor has a duty to take further steps to ensure that the advice given was truly independent and free from duress and that the guarantor full understood the scope of enforcement that could be brought against her.

<P>28. Given the divergent accounts of the deponents in this motion and the divergent positions of parties to the action with respect to the effect of the Guarantee, genuine issues of fact exist which will require a judge to make findings of fact and credibility based on hearing <EM>viva voce</EM> evidence.</P></BLOCK3>
