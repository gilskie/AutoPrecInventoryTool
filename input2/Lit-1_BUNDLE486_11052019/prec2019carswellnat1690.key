<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">AFFIDAVIT OF SAAD DOUAB</TI>
<P>I, Saad Douab, of the City of Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario, SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT:</P>
<P>1. I am an auditor with the Offshore Compliance Division in the International and Ottawa Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;CRA&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. In the course of my work as an auditor, one of my main roles is to conduct income tax compliance audits. An income tax compliance audit is an audit of tax returns and filings filed by a taxpayer to review the appropriateness of assessments issued by the CRA, which are based on those returns and filings. The purpose of an audit process is to verify and confirm that the returns and filings comply with all relevant provisions of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;). One of my main duties in conducting an audit is to contact the taxpayer, or their representative, and request specific documentation, books and records which support the amounts reported and claimed in the taxpayer's income tax returns and filings.</P>
<P>3. I have access to the tax files and records of the CRA pertaining to the Respondent and as such have personal knowledge of the matters to which I hereinafter depose, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated, I verily believe them to be true.</P>
<P>4. On September 2, 2016, I was assigned conduct of an income tax compliance audit of the Respondent, for the 2006 to 2015 taxation years.</P>
<P>5. In order to conduct the income tax compliance audit of the Respondent, I needed to review various books, records and documents to verify that the taxpayer's income tax filings and returns were in compliance with relevant provisions of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>6. On September 16, 2016, I sent a letter via registered mail to the Respondent advising him of an income tax compliance audit of his personal income tax years for the period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2015. The letter contained a questionnaire seeking information, books and records which I would need to conduct the income tax compliance audit (the &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;). The Demand Letter was issued pursuant to ss. 231.1 (1) of the <EM>Act</EM>. A copy of this letter, including the questionnaire, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>7. On October 11, 2016, I received a faxed T1013 from the Respondent, authorizing his daughter Lin Lin to act as his representative with respect to the compliance audit for the Respondent's 2006 to 2015 taxation years. A copy of the faxed T1013 authorizing Lin Lin is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>8. On October 21, 2016, I received a fax from Sean Hu which enclosed a T1013 form authorizing Mr. Hu (the &ldquo;Representative&rdquo;) to represent the Respondent with respect to the income tax compliance audit. In a letter attached to the fax, the Representative advised he had written to the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) challenging the legality of the audit and requested that the audit of the Respondent's tax returns be put on hold until a response had been received from the Minister. A copy of the Representative's documents faxed on October 21, 2016, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>9. On October 25, 2016, the Representative called to confirm that his fax had been received. I confirmed it had been received and that we would follow up with him soon.</P>
<P>10. On November 7, 2016, I sent the Representative a letter advising that, despite his request to have the audit put on hold, the audit would proceed as planned and reiterated the demand for the Respondent to provide the information requested in the Demand Letter. A copy of my letter dated November 7, 2016, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>11. On November 17, 2016, I received a fax from the Representative requesting a one month extension to submit the Respondent's responses and documents as requested in the Demand Letter on the basis that the Respondent had recently undergone surgery in China. A copy of the November 17, 2016, letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>12. On November 18, 2016, I sent the Representative a letter advising that the requested extension of time was allowed and that the Respondent was to provide the requested information and documents no later than December 17, 2016. A copy of the letter dated November 18, 2016, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>13. On December 16, 2016, the Representative sent me a letter advising that the Respondent had concerns regarding the audit. In that fax, the Representative also asked me questions about the questionnaire contained in the Demand Letter. A copy of the December 16, 2016, letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>14. On January 12, 2017, I sent a letter to the Representative replying to the issues raised in his letter dated December 16, 2016. I also requested that the Respondent provide the information requested in the Demand Letter by January 20, 2017. A copy of the documents I faxed on January 12, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>15. On January 17, 2017, I received a letter from the Representative that contained additional questions in relation to the questionnaire contained in the Demand Letter as well as a request for a 6 months extension for the Respondent to provide the information and documents requested in the Demand Letter. A copy of the Representative's letter dated January 17, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>16. On April 5, 2017, I sent a letter to the Representative reiterating our request under s. 231.1 of the <EM>Act</EM> for the Respondent to provide the information requested in the Demand Letter and I advised that should the Respondent fail to comply within 30 days, the CRA could pursue a compliance order in Federal Court pursuant to s. 231.7 of the <EM>Act</EM>. A copy of the April 5, 2017, letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>17. On May 4, 2017, I received a letter from the Representative raising numerous concerns, including a suspicion that the audit conducted by the CRA was a fraud. A copy of the letter dated May 4, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>18. On May 17, 2017, my team leader, Matthew Covey and I had a phone conversation with, the Representative to discuss the issues raised in his letter dated May 4, 2017. During that conversation the Representative requested an in-person audit interview during which he would provide to us the Respondent's answers to the questionnaire contained in the Demand Letter.</P>
<P>19. On May 18, 2017, my team leader, Matthew Covey, faxed a letter to the Representative proposing that the in-person interview occur either on June 1 or June 2, 2017, at the Toronto East Tax Services Office. A copy of the letter sent on May 18, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>20. On May 19, 2017, the Representative responded to our interview request letter dated May 18, 2017, advising that he would attend the meeting which he requested be held on June 2, 2017. A copy of the letter sent on May 19, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>21. Also on May 19, 2017, Mr. Covey sent a fax to the Representative confirming the date of the meeting on June 2, 2017, and advised that his expectation was that the Respondent would be in attendance. A copy of the fax sent on May 19, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>22. On June 2, 2017, my team leader Matthew Covey and I attended the meeting in Toronto with the Representative. The Respondent did not attend the meeting nor did he provide the documents requested.</P>
<P>23. On June 7, 2017, I received a letter from the Representative dated May 4, 2017, as a follow up from the June 2, 2017, meeting. In his letter, the Representative requested another extension of time for the Respondent to provide the remainder of the information and documents sought in the Demand Letter. A copy of the letter dated May 4, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>24. On June 20, 2017, I sent a letter to the Representative giving the Respondent until August 18, 2017, to produce the information and documents requested in the Demand Letter, and that should the Respondent fail to do so, a Compliance Order under ss. 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> would be sought in Federal Court. A copy of this letter dated June 20, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>25. On July 4, 2017, I received a letter from the Representative in which he invoked various reasons for the Respondent not to comply with the Demand Letter. A copy of this letter dated July 4, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>26. On July 7, 2017, my team leader Matthew Covey and I called the Representative to get some clarification on his July 4, 2017, letter.</P>
<P>27. On August 4, 2017, I sent a letter to the Representative which addressed each of the issues raised in his July 4, 2017, letter, and reiterated CRA's demand for the information and documents requested in the Demand Letter pursuant to s. 231.1 of the <EM>Act</EM> by August 18, 2017. A copy of the August 4, 2017, letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;R&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>28. On August 11, 2017, I received another letter from the Representative arguing about the validity of the audit. A copy of the August 11, 2017, letter is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>29. By August 18, 2017, I had not received the information requested in the Demand Letter.</P>
<P>30. In the days that followed, I decided to initiate a request to the Department of Justice to pursue a compliance order pursuant to ss. 231.7 of the <EM>ITA</EM>.</P>
<P>31. On November 16, 2017, the Director of the of the International and Ottawa Tax Service office sent a letter to the Department of Justice, Tax Law Services, requesting that a compliance order application be pursued in this matter. C&ea;dric Renaud-Lafrance, counsel with the Department of Justice, Tax Law Services, contacted me and advised that he would assume carriage of this matter.</P>
<P>32. On December 1, 2017, C&ea;dric Renaud-Lafrance, counsel for the Applicant, sent a letter to the Respondent informing her that should she not provide the information and documentation requested in the Demand Letter by December 20, 2017, his instructions were to commence a compliance order application to enforce the Demand Letter. A copy of this letter was forwarded to me and is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>33. On December 20, 2017, the Representative responded to Mr. Renaud-Lafrance by way of letter but did not provide the information and documents as requested in the Demand Letter. A copy of this letter dated December 20, 2017, is attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo;</BOLD> to this affidavit.</P>
<P>34. To date, I have still not received all of the books, records or information as set out in the Demand Letter sent pursuant to ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>35. The Demand Letter I have sent to the Respondent pursuant to ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> are for the purpose of conducting the civil income tax compliance audit. As an auditor with the Offshore Compliance, Audit Division, I only conduct civil income tax compliance audits. I do not conduct investigations concerning criminal offences under the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>36. I make this affidavit in support of the Notice of Summary Application and for no other or improper use.</P>

<P>6. I married Min Wang in 1986 and had our only daughter Lin Lin in December 1987.</P>
<P>7. I pursued post-graduate studies at South China Agricultural University from 1992 to 1994 and obtained a master's degree in science majoring in poultry disease.</P>
<P>8. I started working in the field of pig farming in a public company, Shenzhen Kondral (group) Co. LTD, from 1994 to 2012 in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, and worked my way up to the position of Vice-President of the company overseeing the entire agriculture sector.</P>
<P>9. Prior to entering Canada, I received landed immigrant status in Canada.</P>
<P>10. In May of 2004, my wife, Min Wang, made an application for permanent residence in China on behalf of myself, herself and my daughter.</P>
<P>11. I came to Canada as a landed immigrant on May 26, 2005 with my wife and daughter.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Interactions with CRA</UNDER></TI>
<P>42. I received a letter from CRA addressed to me, dated September 16, 2016, and reviewed the letter with my authorized representative Sean Hu, CPA CGA.</P>
<P>43. Mr. Hu indicated that he had concerns regarding the enforceability of the letter because the letter did not meet the criteria of section 231.1, since the letter is addressed to me personally, and &ldquo;other entities&rdquo; and as a result, the Minister cannot satisfy paragraph 231.7(1)(a) because I am not a person who &ldquo;was required to under 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document and did not do so&rdquo;.</P>
<P>44. Further we discussed the broad language of the questionnaire, and the inability to understand exactly what CRA is requesting in terms of information.</P>
<P>45.1had extensive discussions with Sean Hu with respect to my residency in Canada for tax purposes.</P>
<P>46. As a result, we determined that I was a resident of China for tax purposes.</P>
<P>47. To support my position that I am a resident of China for tax purposes, I provided Sean Hu with a great deal of information that enabled him to write up a three page letter that he would submit on my behalf to CRA at the June 2, 2017 meeting.</P>
<P>48. The three page document dated May 31, 2017 is entitled &ldquo;Determination of Mr. Xue Lin's Residency for Tax Purpose&rdquo;.</P>
<P>49. I have discussed with my authorized representative that I have never been a resident of Canada for tax purposes, since I have always lived and worked in China, and infrequently come to Canada to visit my wife and my daughter.</P>
<P>50. Sean Hu, my authorized representative, continued to have verbal and written discussions with CRA expressing his concerns regarding the September 16, 2016 letter, due to the general and broad language of the questionnaire.</P>
<P>51. Further Mr. Hu advised that he continued to express his concerns continually in order to better ascertain what specifically was being requested.</P>
<P>52. My authorized representative secured a few extensions of time in order to secure documents and information for CRA.</P>
<P>53. My representative advised me that it is unusual that CRA did not have an initial interview with me, and my representative requested either a transfer of my file a to Toronto Tax Service Office, or for the auditor to come from Ottawa to have a meeting in person.</P>
<P>54. My representative advised me that he secured a meeting on June 2, 2017 and that I would be presenting the auditor, Saad Douab, with banking documents and the completed questionnaire.</P>
<P>55. On June 2, 2017, my wife attended the meeting with Sean Hu, CPA CGA, Matthew Covey, the CRA Team Leader, and the auditor, Saad Douab.</P>
<P>56. At the meeting, Mr. Hu and my wife stated that no submissions would be made on my behalf, other than stating that I am a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes.</P>
<P>57. I have always worked and lived in China, and infrequently come to Canada to visit my wife and daughter for very brief periods of time.</P>
<P>58. At that point my wife and the authorized representative were under the impression that this satisfied the requirements of the CRA Team Leader and the Auditor.</P>
<P>59. At the end of the meeting they provided my wife with a letter dated June 2, 2017, which is attached <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD>, and as I understood it, I was required to answer new additional questions surrounding the June 2, 2017 letter.</P>
<P>60. Some time went by and my representative contacted me, stating that we had not satisfied the September 16, 2016 letter and questionnaire.</P>
<P>61. My representative and I were confused because we thought that we had already satisfied those requirements at the meeting on June 2, 2017.</P>
<P>62. As a result, my representative communicated to CRA that there was some confusion surrounding the September 16, 2016 letter and June 2, 2017 letter and he further asked CRA what information was still outstanding and he advised that CRA did not answer our questions in terms of what documents or information were still outstanding, however I still wanted to comply.</P>
<P>63. My representative further advised me that the Department of Justice had sent a letter indicating that the September 16, 2016 questionnaire was not satisfactorily answered and that they wanted an answer by a certain deadline and my representative advised me that he wrote a letter asking what specifically was needed to comply and he received no response.</P>
<P>64. I understand that my authorized representative attempted to secure CRA's and the Department of Justice's determination of my residency for tax purposes prior to dealing with the request of information pursuant to CRA's letter dated September 16, 2016 and the questionnaire.</P>
<P>65. At all times I wanted to comply with my obligations pursuant to the ITA.</P>
<P>66. I make this affidavit in response to the applicant's motion herein and make this affidavit for no improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT OF SEAN HU</TI>
<P><BOLD>I, Sean Hu,</BOLD> of the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, in Canada, <BOLD>HEREBY MAKE OATH AND SAY:</BOLD>
<P1>1. I am a Public Chartered Accountant for Lin Lin, Xue Lin and Min Wang.</P1>
<P1>2. Where I express opinions in this Affidavit, those are founded on my experience, my discussions with Ming Wang, Xue Lin, Lin Lin and CRA representatives.</P1>
<P1>3. Where I make statements in the context of this Affidavit that are not within my personal knowledge, I identify the source of the information and verily believe the information to be true.</P1>
<P1>4. Min Wang, Lin Lin and Xue Lin reached out to me to retain my advice regarding a tax matter.</P1>
<P1>5. I reviewed the letter of September 16, 2016 and the questionnaire.</P1>
<P1>6. I indicated that I had concerns regarding the enforceability of the letter because the letter did not meet the criteria of section 231.1 since the letter is addressed to my clients personally, as well as &ldquo;other entities&rdquo; were referred to, and as a result, the Minister cannot satisfy paragraph 231.7(1)(a) because the person who &ldquo;was required to under 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document and did not do so&rdquo; is not ascertainable.</P1>
<P1>7. Further we discussed the broad language of the questionnaire, and the inability to understand exactly what CRA is requesting in terms of information, I advised the clients to secure as many documents with respect to the September 16, 2016 letter and the questionnaire, so I did so.</P1>
<P1>8. We discussed the fact that Xue Lin has never been a resident of Canada for tax purposes, since he has always lived and worked in China.</P1>
<P1>9. I was instructed by Min Wang, Lin Lin and Xue Lin to contact CRA both orally and in written format in order to provide them with comprehensive advice in order to act on their behalf.</P1>
<P1>10. I had a series of communications with CRA in which I advised them of the aforementioned concerns.</P1>
<P1>11. After receiving the auditor's letter dated April 5, 2017, I spoke with my clients and agreed to submit the information and documents as requested, however I still had many concerns regarding the security of the documents if sent by mail, so I sent a letter on May 4, 2017, to the auditor, expressing such concerns.</P1>
<P1>12. I advised my clients that it is unusual that CRA did not start the interaction with the taxpayers first and I advised the auditor that we requested a meeting in person.</P1>
<P1>13. I requested that the auditor located in Ottawa to (1) either transfer the file to Toronto in order to meet in Toronto, or (2) that the auditor located in Ottawa could come to Toronto to meet.</P1>
<P1>14. A week leader, the team leader, Matthew Covey, called me and told me that he and the auditor, Saad Douab, would come to Toronto to meet, and we would submit our documents then.</P1>
<P1>15. Upon confirming the date of said meeting, I was advised that Min Wang would appear on behalf of her husband and daughter.</P1>
<P1>16. CRA did not make it mandatory for my clients to attend, but Min Wang attended in person with the necessary banking documents, completed questionnaire, and answered questions on behalf of herself and her daughter.</P1>
<P1>17. I had extensive discussions with Xue Lin with respect to his residency in Canada for tax purposes.</P1>
<P1>18. As a result, Xue Lin provided me with a great deal of information that enabled me to make a three page written submission on his behalf to CRA on June 2, 2017, entitled &ldquo;Determination of Mr. Xue Lin's Residency for Tax Purpose&rdquo; dated May 31, 2017.</P1>
<P1>19. Min Wang came for the meeting and at the beginning of the meeting she submitted the documents and completed questionnaires to the CRA officials.</P1>
<P1>20. The CRA officials went through every question on the questionnaire and looked at the documents.</P1>
<P1>21. During the meeting, the auditor gave Min Wang three sets of letters dated June 2, 2017.</P1>
<P1>22. I have advised CRA both verbally and in writing that my husband, Xue Lin, is not a resident for tax purposes.</P1>
<P1>23. I explained to the CRA officials that Xue Lin, has always worked and lived in China, and infrequently comes to Canada to visit his family.</P1>
<P1>24. In the June 2, 2017 letter, the taxpayers were asked to explain some amounts of incoming funds deposited or credited to their bank accounts.</P1>
<P1>25. From that point on my understanding was that we had met the requirements of the September 16, 2016 letter, and now had to focus on the June 2, 2017 letter's questions, but that we needed some more time, as expressed in my June 7, 2017 letter.</P1>
<P1>26. However, I received a letter dated June 20, 2017 from the auditor with no reference to the June 2, 2017 letter's requirements.</P1>
<P1>27. In my letter dated July 4, 2017, I followed up with CRA regarding their determination of Xue Lin's residency in Canada for tax purpose.</P1>
<P1>28. The auditor's August 4, 2017 letter showed that they had intended to start over with their old package of demands outlined in the initial letter and that they had abandoned the June 2, 2017 requirements.</P1>
<P1>29. At that time, my understanding was that the information and documents that Min Wang provided to Mr. Covey on June 2, 2017 had substantially met the requirements of the initial letter.</P1>
<P1>30. Several things were clear to me: (1) the questionnaires were completed; (2) bank statements of various banks were provided; and (3) no documents from Xue Lin were provided because he is a non-resident for the purpose of taxation in Canada.</P1>
<P1>31. In order to let the taxpayers know how to comply with what the auditor wanted, I asked the auditor to let me know what documents were outstanding in my letter to the Auditor, dated August 11, 2018.</P1>
<P1>32. I was expecting the auditor to give me a clear answer, however he did not get back to me.</P1>
<P1>33. Then I received a letter dated December 1, 2017 from the Justice Department lawyer making the same demand without the intention to answer my question.</P1>
<P1>34. In my letter dated December 20, 2017, I once again asked the lawyer to clarify which documents were being demanded, yet I received no response as to what particular documents or information were outstanding.</P1>
<P1>35. In particular, I stated in the aforementioned letter that firstly CRA has to establish Xue Lin's residency in Canada for the purpose of taxation before discussion could begin regarding requests for information pursuant to the September 16, 2016 letter and the attached questionnaire.</P1>
<P1>36. As the request was unclear, there was no way to comply.</P1>
<P1>37. I make this affidavit in response to the applicant's motion herein and make this affidavit for no improper purpose.</P1></P>

<P><BOLD>I, Min Wang</BOLD>, of the City of Puslinch, in the Province of Ontario, in Canada, <BOLD>HEREBY MAKE OATH AND SAY:</BOLD></P>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Where I make statements in the context of this Affidavit that are not within my personal knowledge, I identify the source of the information and verily believe the information to be true.</P>
<P>2. I reside at XXXXXXXXXX.</P>
<P>3. I was born in XXXXXXXXXX in Nanzhao, in the province of Henan, in the People's Republic of China (&ldquo;China&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. I am the wife of Xue Lin and the mother of Lin Lin.</P>
<P>5. I received my undergraduate education in Henan University of Animal Husbandry and Economy.</P>
<P>6. After graduation, in 1983, I became a lecture instructor at Henan University of Animal Husbandry and Economy.</P>
<P>7. In 1986, I married Xue Lin and gave birth to my only daughter, Lin Lin, in December 1987.</P>
<P>8. I pursued post-graduate studies in South China Agricultural University from 1993 to 1995, and obtained a master's degree in science majoring in animal nutrition.</P>
<P>9. I started working in the field of animal feed from 1995 all the way to July 2005 in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.</P>
<P>10. In May of 2004, I made an application for permanent residence in China on behalf of myself, my husband and my daughter.</P>
<P>11. The purpose behind coming to Canada was so that our daughter could get a better education in Canada.</P>
<P>12. I came with my family to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in July 2005.</P>
<P>13. In Canada, my daughter attended high school for grades 11 and 12, and completed her undergrad and postgrad education.</P>
<P>14. In order to support the family, my husband, Xue Lin, flew back to China two weeks after landing in Canada, in July 2005, to continue his career.</P>
<P>15. My husband, Xue Lin, has always worked and resided in China.</P>
<P>16. Since 2005, I have been working at Chinese restaurants, volunteering at the University of Guelph as a lab assistant, and attending ESL school in my spare time.</P>
<P>17. I have substantial ties to Canada, including my principle residence, a few rental properties that I manage, personal belongings, a vehicle, insurance, bank accounts and a driver's license in Canada.</P>
<P>18. Beginning in 2005, using funds from my husband, from China, several investment houses for rental purpose were bought under my name, my daughter's name and jointly with my husband.</P>
<P>19. These aforementioned rental properties are all in Ontario and I took care of all the rental properties.</P>
<P>20. Attached is <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A</BOLD>&rdquo;, which lists all of the properties that were purchased in my name.</P>
<P>21. Xue Lin and I bought a house in Guelph in September 2005 and decided I would stay with my daughter while she went to high school in Guelph, Ontario.</P>
<P>22. My husband, Xue Lin, paid a short visit to Canada in September 2005 for the closing of the house.</P>
<P>23. This house became a rental property in 2007 when my daughter, Lin Lin, moved into a new house and was sold in 2018.</P>
<P>24. Since 2007, using fonds from my husband, Xue, two rental townhouses were bought solely under my name and three rental townhouses were bought under both my name and my husband, Xue's, and two of them were sold in 2018.</P>
<P>25. In 2010, a house in Guelph, Ontario was purchased under my name, using fonds from my husband from China, which was used as a principal residence for myself and our daughter, Lin, and was later sold in 2015.</P>
<P>26. I moved into a new house that I jointly owned with my husband, using fonds from the sale of the old home.</P>
<P>27. In 2018, I obtained paid employment at the University of Guelph as a lab assistant.</P>
<P>28. For the duration of these years, my major sources of income have been employment income, rental income and investment income from mutual fonds at TD Canada Trust.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>Interactions with CRA</UNDER></TI>
<P>29. I received a letter from CRA dated September 16, 2016, and reviewed the letter with my representative Sean Hu, CPA CGA.</P>
<P>30. Mr. Hu indicated that he had concerns regarding the enforceability of the letter because the letter did not meet the criteria of section 231.1 since the letter is addressed to me personally, and &ldquo;other entities&rdquo; and as a result, the Minister cannot satisfy paragraph 231.7(1) because I am not a person who &ldquo;was required to under 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document and did not do so&rdquo;.</P>
<P>31. Further we discussed the broad language of the questionnaire, and the inability to understand exactly what CRA is requesting in terms of information, however Mr. Hu advised me to secure as many documents with respect to the September 16, 2016 letter and the questionnaire, so I did so.</P>
<P>32. We discussed that my husband has never been a resident of Canada for tax purposes, since he has always lived and worked in China.</P>
<P>33. Sean Hu continued to have verbal and written discussions with CRA expressing his concerns regarding the September 16, 2016 letter.</P>
<P>34. Further Mr. Hu advised that he continued to express his concerns continually in order to better ascertain what specifically was being requested.</P>
<P>35. My authorized representative secured a few extensions of time in order for me to secure documents and information for CRA.</P>
<P>36. My representative advised me that it is unusual that CRA did not have an initial interview with me, and my representative requested either a transfer of my file a to Toronto Tax Service Office, or for the auditor to come from Ottawa to have a meeting in person.</P>
<P>37. My representative advised me that he secured a meeting on June 2, 2017 and that I would be presenting the auditor, Saad Douab, with banking documents and the completed questionnaire.</P>
<P>38. On June 2, 2017, I attended the meeting with Sean Hu, CPA CGA, Matthew Covey, the CRA Team Leader, and the auditor, Saad Douab.</P>
<P>39. I provided my completed questionnaire and bank documents.</P>
<P>40. Additionally, I provided the completed questionnaire and bank documents for my daughter, Lin Lin.</P>
<P>41. At the meeting, Mr. Hu and I stated that only the documents relating to myself and my daughter, Lin Lin, would be submitted, and that no submissions would be made on behalf of my husband, Xue Lin, is a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes.</P>
<P>42. My husband has always worked and lived in China, and infrequently comes to Canada to visit my daughter for a very brief period of time.</P>
<P>43. We reviewed the answers to the questionnaires and they asked a series of questions with respect to the documents and I provided answers on behalf of my daughter and myself.</P>
<P>44. At that point I was under the impression that this satisfied the requirements of the CRA Team Leader and the Auditor.</P>
<P>45. I was not provided with a receipt confirming that said documentation had been provided, nor that the submitted answers to the questionnaires had also been provided.</P>
<P>46. At the end of the meeting they provided me with a letter dated June 2, 2017, which is attached <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B</BOLD>&rdquo;, and as I understood it, I was required to answer new additional questions surrounding the June 2, 2017 letter.</P>
<P>47. Some time went by and my representative contacted me, stating that we had not satisfied the September 16, 2016 letter and questionnaire.</P>
<P>48. My representative and I were confused because we thought that we had already satisfied those requirements at the meeting on June 2, 2017.</P>
<P>49. As a result, my representative communicated to CRA that there was some confusion surrounding the September 16, 2016 letter and June 2, 2017 letter and he further asked CRA what information was still outstanding and he advised me that CRA did not answer his question in terms of what documents or information was still outstanding, however I still wanted to comply.</P>
<P>50. My representative further advised me the Department of Justice sent a letter indicating that the September 16, 2016 questionnaire was not satisfactorily answered and that they wanted an answer by a certain deadline and my representative advised me that he wrote a letter asking what specifically was needed to comply and he received no response.</P>
<P>51. At all times I wanted to comply with my obligations pursuant to the ITA.</P>
<P>52. I make this affidavit in response to the applicant's motion herein and make this affidavit for no improper purpose.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Parliament has granted the Minister of National Revenue broad powers to require any person to provide information and documentation for the purpose of the Minister conducting an audit to determine if a taxpayer's income tax filings and the assessments issued by the Minister are in compliance with the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>. These powers are necessary for the administration and enforcement of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> and to otherwise preserve the integrity of the self-reporting system.</P>
<P>2. In the present case, the Respondent has failed to produce all of the books, records and information which the Canada Revenue Agency requested he produce in the course of an income tax compliance audit of her 2006 to 2015 taxation years. The request for books and records was made under the authority granted pursuant to s. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>.</P>
<P>3. An initial request letter dated September 16, 2016 was duly issued by the Minister requesting production of the Respondent's information for the period under audit. Despite numerous follow up letters reminding the Respondent of his obligation to provide the information requested, the Respondent has failed to fully comply with the request letter.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART 1&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>4. In September 2016, the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) commenced an audit of the personal income tax returns of the Respondent for the 2006 to 2015 taxation years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Saad Douab, affirmed September 10, 2018 (&ldquo;Douab Affidavit&rdquo;), Application Record, Tab 2, para. 4.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>5. On September 16, 2016, Saad Douab, auditor at the CRA (the &ldquo;Auditor&rdquo;), via Priority Post, sent a demand letter to the Respondent advising her of an audit of her personal income taxation years 2006 to 2015 (the &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;). The Demand Letter was issued pursuant to ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>RSC 1985, c 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;) and contained a questionnaire seeking information, books and records needed to conduct the audit. The Auditor requested that the information requested in the Demand Letter be provided by October 21, 2016.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 6 and Exhibit A.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. On October 11, 2016, the Auditor received a faxed T1013 from the Respondent, authorizing his daughter Lin Lin to act as his representative with respect to the compliance audit for the Respondent's 2006 to 2015 taxation years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 7 and Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. On October 21, 2016, the Auditor received a fax from a certain Sean Hu which enclosed a letter and a T1013 form authorizing Mr. Hu (the &ldquo;Representative&rdquo;) to act as the Respondent's representative with respect to her income tax compliance audit. As part of that fax, the Representative informed the Auditor that he had written to the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) challenging the legality of the audit and requested that the audit of the Respondent's tax returns be put on hold until a response had been received from the Minister.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 8 and Exhibit C.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>8. On October 25, 2016, the Representative called the Auditor to confirm receipt of his fax. The Auditor confirmed receipt of the fax and advised the Representative that a response would be forthcoming.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. On November 7, 2016, the Auditor wrote to the Representative advising that the audit would proceed as planned. The Auditor also granted the Respondent a 10 day extension of time to November 17, 2016, to provide the information requested in the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 10, and Exhibit D</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. On November 17, 2016, the Representative faxed a letter to the Auditor requesting a one month extension of time. The reason provided for the need of an extension was that the Respondent had undergone surgery in China.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 11, and Exhibit E.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. On November 18, 2016, the Auditor granted the requested extension of time and set December 17, 2016 as the new deadline for the Respondent to comply with the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 12 and Exhibit F.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>12. On December 16, 2016, the Representative faxed a letter to the Auditor advising that the Respondent had concerns regarding the audit and requested clarification concerning some of the questions asked in the questionnaire that was attached to the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 13 and Exhibit G.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. On January 12, 2017, the Auditor wrote back to the Representative, responding to the Representative's latest letter. The Auditor set a new deadline of January 20, 2017 for the Respondent to provide the information originally requested in the Demand Letter by January 20, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 14 and Exhibit H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. On January 17, 2017, the Auditor received a letter from the Representative which contained additional questions with respect to the questionnaire attached to the Demand Letter as well as a request for a 6 months extension for the Respondent to provide the requested information and documents, arguing that additional time was required given the nature and complexity of the records being sought.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 15 and Exhibit I.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. On April 5, 2017, the Auditor sent a letter to the Representative responding to the questions asked in his letter dated January 17, 2017. The Auditor set the date of May 4, 2017 as the new date by which the Respondent had to comply with the Demand Letter. The Auditor advised that failure to comply within 30 days could result in the CRA pursuing a compliance order in Federal Court pursuant to s. 231.7 of the <EM>Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 16 and Exhibit J.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. On May 4, 2017, the Representative sent a letter to the Auditor stating that Respondent had numerous concerns regarding the legitimacy of the audit and stated that the Respondent was suspicious that the audit was fraudulent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 17 and Exhibit K.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. On May 17, 2017, the Auditor, his team leader, Mr. Matthew Covey and the Representative discussed the issues raised in the Representative's letter of May 4, 2017. During this conversation, the Representative requested an in-person meeting advising that, at that time, the Respondent would provide the completed questionnaire.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. On May 18, 2017, Mr. Covey, faxed a letter to the Representative proposing that the in-person interview occur either on June 1 or June 2, 2017, at the Toronto East Tax Services Office. In that letter, the CRA advised the Representative of the expectation that both the Representative and his client would attend the meeting.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 19 and Exhibit L.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. On May 19, 2017, the Representative faxed a letter dated May 18, 2017 to Mr. Covey advising that he would attend the meeting which he requested be held on June 2, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 20 and Exhibit M.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Also on May 19, 2017, Mr. Covey sent a fax to the Representative confirming the date of the meeting as June 2, 2017, and reiterated that the CRA expectation was that the Respondent would be in attendance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 21 and Exhibit N.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>21. On June 2, 2017, the Auditor and Mr. Covey attended the meeting with the Representative. The Respondent did not attend the meeting nor did he provide the requested documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 22.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. On June 7, 2017, the Representative sent the Auditor a letter dated May 4, 2017, requesting a further 2 month extension of time arguing that the Respondent required additional time to provide the documents and information sought.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 23 and Exhibit O.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. On June 20, 2017, the auditor wrote to the Representative, advising that the Respondent had been granted an extension of time until August 18, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 24 and Exhibit P.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. On July 4, 2017, the Representative sent the Auditor a letter stating that the auditors were acting outside of the law and requested that a new letter to comply be issued by the CRA. In that letter, the Representative cited various explanations for the Respondent's noncompliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 25 and Exhibit Q.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. On July 7, 2017, the Auditor and Mr. Covey had a call with the Representative to address the purpose of his letter dated July 4, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. On August 4, 2017, the Auditor wrote to the Representative providing answers to each of the issues raised in his letter dated July 4, 2017. The Auditor also advised that the Demand Letter was enforceable and reiterated that the deadline for the Respondent to comply with it was August 18, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 27 and Exhibit R.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. On August 11, 2017, the Representative sent another letter to the Auditor questioning the validity of the audit, requesting further clarification with respect to what information was being sought and advising that the Respondent's non-compliance was a result of the CRA's lack of specificity as to what documents were being requested, in addition to the discriminatory process employed by the CRA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 28 and Exhibit S.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. On December 1, 2017, C&ea;dric Renaud-Lafrance, counsel for the Applicant, sent a letter to the Representative stating that should the Respondent not provide the information and documentation requested in the Demand Letter by December 20, 2017, counsel for the Applicant had instructions to commence a compliance order application to enforce the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 32 and Exhibit T.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. On December 20, 2017, the Representative responded to Mr. Renaud-Lafrance by way of letter but did not provide the information and documents as requested in the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 33 and Exhibit U.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. To this date, the CRA has not received all of the books, records and information as set out in the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 34.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. The Demand Letter the Minister has issued to the Respondent is for the purpose of conducting an audit to determine the Respondent's liability for tax for the 2006 to 2015 taxation years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> at para. 35.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>32. The issue is whether the conditions for the issuance of a compliance order under ss. 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> are met in the present case.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>PART III SUBMISSIONS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><TI>Minister's powers to compel production of information and documents</TI>
<P>33. Section 220 of the <EM>Act</EM> provides that the Minister has a duty to administer and enforce the <EM>Act</EM>, and in doing so assess the amount of tax payable by every person liable for tax under the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>34. The Minister's responsibility of assessing tax is not a procedural matter; it is the very essence of the <EM>Act</EM>. Any agreement by the Minister not to tax what the <EM>Act</EM> requires to be taxed would be a dereliction of his duty to enforce the <EM>Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Wenger's Ltd. v MNR</SOC><CITE>92 DTC 2132</CITE><COURTJUR>TCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Application Record, Tab 5, at para. 93.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. The Minister must exercise these powers in a fair and even handed manner and be capable of exercising these powers whether or not he has reasonable grounds for believing that a particular taxpayer has breached the <EM>Act</EM>. Often it will be impossible to determine from the face of the return at the initial time of filing whether any impropriety has occurred in its preparation. A spot check or a system of random monitoring may be the only way in which the integrity of the tax system can be maintained. The integrity of our self-assessing tax system depends on the Minister's broad power to verify compliance with the taxing statutes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>R v McKinlay Transport Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[1990] 1 SCR 627</CITE><COURTJUR>SCC</COURTJUR></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>McKinlay</EM>&rdquo;), Application Record, Tab 6, at paras. 35-36; <CASEREF><SOC>MNR v Redeemer Foundation</SOC><CITE>2006 FCA 325</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2006 DTC 6712</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, Application Record, Tab 7, at paras. 25&ndash;37; aff'd by <CASEREF><CITE>2008 SCC 46</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2008 DTC 6474</CITE></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, Application Record, Tab 7.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. Under ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, the Minister may, for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the <EM>Act</EM>, inspect, audit or examine the books and records of a taxpayer and any document of the taxpayer or of any other person that relates or may relate to the information that is or should be in the books or records of the taxpayer or to any amount payable by the taxpayer under the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>37. A person served with a request for information or requirement under these provisions is required to provide the Minister with the information or documents requested if the Minister is acting for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the <EM>Act</EM> and the person is given a reasonable amount of time for production of the information or documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Minister of National Revenue v Marshall</SOC><CITE>2006 FC 279</CITE></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Marshall</EM>&rdquo;), Application Record, Tab 8, at paras. 16.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Section 231.1 of the <EM>Act</EM>, similarly to section 231.2 of the <EM>Act</EM>, provides the least intrusive means by which effective monitoring of compliance with the <EM>Act</EM> can be effected. It involves no invasion of a taxpayer's home or business premises. It simply calls for the production of records which may be relevant to the filing of an income tax return. A taxpayer's expectation of privacy with regard to these documents <EM>vis-&ag;-vis</EM> the Minister is relatively low. The Minister has no way of knowing whether certain records are relevant until he has had an opportunity to examine them.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>McKinlay</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 29, at para. 37.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Under ss. 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, a judge may order a person to provide any access, information, assistance or documents sought by the Minister if the judge is satisfied that the person was required to do so under ss. 231.1 of the <EM>Act</EM> to provide the access, assistance, information or document and did not do so, and the information or document is not protected from disclosure by solicitor-client privilege as defined in 232(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC, 1985, c 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp), see 231.7(1), Tab 3 (Appendix A) <EM>Marshall</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, note 31, at paras. 17-18.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>How these principles apply to the facts of this instance</TI>
<P>40. On September 16, 2016, the Minister sent the Demand Letter containing a questionnaire to the Respondent requesting the production of specified information, documents and records for income tax compliance audit purposes.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Douab Affidavit, Application Record, Tab 2, at para. 6, (Exhibit A).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Demand Letter was issued pursuant to ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> for the purpose of conducting a civil income tax compliance audit to ascertain the amounts payable by the Respondent under the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>41. The Demand Letter specified October 21, 2016 as the date by which the Respondent was to produce the information, documents and records sought, a deadline the Respondent has not complied with.</P>
<P>42. The Minister granted to the Respondent numerous extension of time to submit the information, documents and records requested in the Demand Letter.</P>
<P>43. Despite being granted additional time, the Respondent continuously failed to comply with the Demand Letter and has as yet to produce all of the information, documents and records requested by the Demand Letter.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Timing of the Income Tax Compliance Audit</TI>
<P>44. There is no time limitation constraining the Minister from requesting production of records for periods exceeding the document retention periods set out in ss. 230(4) of the <EM>Act</EM> or for taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period. As confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Tower v. Minister of National Revenue</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Tower v Minister of National Revenue</SOC><CITE>2003 FCA 307</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2003 DTC 5540</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>FCA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Application Record, Tab 9, at para. 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and <CASEREF><SOC>1144020 Ontario Ltd. v Minister of National Revenue</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>1144020 Ontario Ltd. v Minister of National Revenue</SOC><CITE>2005 FC 813</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2005 DTC 5315</CITE></CORRELAT><COURTJUR>FC</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Application Record, Tab 10, at para. 60.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> ss. 231.1 (1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, is not limited by any statutory time limit. If such records are still available and if the Minister seeks production of them pursuant to ss. 231.1 (1), then the records must be produced</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>No Solicitor-CIient Privilege</TI>
<P>45. Subsection 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> requires that the information, documents and records sought by the Minister are not protected from disclosure by solicitor-client privilege within the meaning of 232(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>ITA</EM>, ss. 232(1), Tab 3 (Appendix A).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>These provisions clearly indicate that the privilege attaches only to communications passing between a solicitor and a client in professional confidence.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Marshall</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 31, Applicant's Record, Tab 8, at para. 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>46. Solicitor-client privilege is not an issue in this matter because the information, documents and records requested in the Demand Letter, are mostly financial and banking records, not documents that would constitute communications passing between a solicitor and a client in professional confidence.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Conclusion</TI>
<P>47. The Respondent has been given a reasonable amount of time to provide the information requested in the Demand Letter and has failed to produce all of the information, documents and records requested.</P>
<P>48. The conditions set out in subsection 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> have been satisfied. Accordingly, the Minister is entitled to an Order pursuant to 231.7(1) of the <EM>Act</EM> compelling the Respondent to produce the information and documents specified in the Demand Letter, including the questionnaire attached to it, within 15 days of the date hereof.</P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V"><UNDER>PART IV&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</UNDER></TI>
<P>49. The Applicant requests an Order compelling the Respondent to provide the Applicant with the information, documents and records as set out in the draft Order at Tab 4 of the Application Record.</P>
<P>50. The Applicant requests costs of this application.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Canadian system tax is based on self-assessment and thus the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) is required to audit the taxpayers to verify whether the taxpayers have complied with their duties and obligations under the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC, 1985, c 1 [&ldquo;<EM>ITA</EM>&rdquo;].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> (hereinafter, the &ldquo;ITA&rdquo;).</P>
<P>2. The Minister has the authority to use the inspection and requirement powers under ss 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) of the ITA.</P>
<P>3. Statutory interpretation has provided for a broad interpretation of the subsection of 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>4. The Minister states that subsection of 231.1 of the ITA provides for broad audit powers, but the respondent's position is that the Minister's audit powers are not unlimited.</P>
<P>5. The Minister does not have the authority in this instance to tax a resident of China based on his worldwide income, despite the fact that the Chinese national has filed Canadian tax returns in the past.</P>
<P>6. A summary application by the Minister for a compliance order under section 231.7 of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> in relation to the respondent providing answers to the questionnaire attached to Canada Revenue Agency's letter dated September 16, 2016.</P>
<P>7. Potentially serious consequences can flow from the failure to obey a compliance order, including fines and/or imprisonment.</P>
<P>8. A compliance order can only be issued if the Minister proves that the respondent did not comply with section 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>9. The respondent's position is that the Minister did not comply with section 231.1 of the ITA because the Minister did not inspect, audit and examine the books, records and property of respondent but rather requested to obtain information. Thus, the Minister should have used section 231.2 of the ITA to require or demand the information from the respondent.</P>
<P>10. In the alternative, if the Court finds that the Minister has complied with section 231.1 of the ITA, the respondent has provided partial answers to the Minister's letter and questionnaire because it is unclear what remains outstanding with respect to the September 16, 2016 letter and questionnaire, despite the authorized representative.</P>
<P>11. The respondent raises the issue of whether the conditions for the issuance of a compliance order under subsection 231.7 of the ITA are met in the present case.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>PART I&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. On September 2, 2016, the auditor stated that he was assigned a compliance audit for the years 2006 to 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Saad Douab, affirmed September 10, 2018 at para 4 [&ldquo;<EM>Douab Affidavit</EM>&rdquo;].</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>16. The registered letter says &ldquo;[y]our personal income tax return and any other related or associated entities&rdquo;, none of which have been named.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit A and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 6.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. Further, the letter states &ldquo;...[t]he Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is in possession of information that has led us to determine that you may have offshore holdings that you have failed to disclosed as required by the Income Tax. Act.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The auditor referred to the September 16, 2016 registered letter as the &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo; and stated that issued pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. The registered letter asks for information and makes no statement that a response is &ldquo;required&rdquo; and it does not set out the consequences for non-compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. Once the respondent received the registered letter dated September 16, 2016, he contacted Sean Hu, C.P.A., C.G.A, with respect to securing representation.</P>
<P>21. The auditor stated that the representative advised the auditor that he sent a letter to the Minster of National Revenue with respect to challenging the legality of the audit and requested that CRA hold the matter down until he secures a response from the Minister.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit C and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. The auditor states that on October 25, 2016 the representative contacted him to confirm that he received his fax, and the auditor confirmed that the fax was received and &ldquo;...that we would follow up with him soon.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit D and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The auditor states that in his correspondence to the taxpayer's representative dated November 7, 2016, that &ldquo;...the audit would proceed as originally planned&rdquo; and reiterated the demand for the Respondent to provide the information requested in the initial letter dated September 16, 2016.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit D and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, the auditor asked for &ldquo;information requested as outlined in our initial letter&rdquo; and not &ldquo;books and records&rdquo;.</P>
<P>24. In the November 7, 2016 letter, the auditor stated: &ldquo;We ask that you please provide information requested as outlined in our initial dated September 16, 2016 within 10 days of this letter.&rdquo; Again, at the time this was not stated as a &ldquo;Demand&rdquo;, but a request and no consequence presented if there is not compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit D and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 10.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. On November 17, 2016, the representative for the respondent faxed a letter to the auditor requesting an extension of time to submit documents because the respondent had surgery in China and that he had surgery in China because he ordinarily lives in China.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit E and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 11.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. The auditor does not call its November 18, 2016 letter a &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo; and refers to &ldquo;the requested information and documents&rdquo; and provides a formal extension no later than December 17, 2016.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit F and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>27. The reply letter the dated November 18, 2016 from the auditor again refers to the &ldquo;information requested&rdquo;, not demanded or required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit F and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28. Further, the auditor then indicated that if the information was not received, CRA would pursue issuing a Compliance Order under subsection 231.7 of the ITA and the said letter does not state the consequences of non-compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit F and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 1.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. In a letter dated December 16, 2016, the representative for the respondent advised auditor that he had concerns regarding the audit and thus raised questions regarding the procedural issues concerning the answering of the questions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit F and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>30. Further, the representative for the respondent raised the issue of &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; if the request is made under subsection 231.6 of the Income Tax Act, which allows for a minimum of 90 days to respond.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>31. Further to the above, the representative for the respondent raised the issue about travel to meet with the auditor and a request was made to move the audit to Toronto.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. It took the auditor in or around four (4) weeks to reply to the representative's letter dated December 16, 2016.</P>
<P>33. On the cover page, the auditor stated that the deadline was extended once again, this time to January 20, 2017.</P>
<P>34. Further, the auditor stated that this was allowing the taxpayer more than 90 days.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit H and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. Further to the above, the auditor called the information &ldquo;... requested information&rdquo; and the original letter, September 16, 2016, a &ldquo;request letter&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit H and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 14.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>36. In CRA's letter dated January 12, 2017, it refers to the &ldquo;...completed information requested&rdquo; and makes no mention of the consequences of not complying with 231.7 of the Income Tax Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. Further, CRA advised the representative that &ldquo;[w]hen necessary, we will travel to your area to meet with you in due time.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The auditor also references to the original letter was being dated September 22, 2016, which was not attached as an Exhibit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. In the auditor's letter dated January 12, 2017 the auditor stated that CRA would be pursuing a Compliance Order despite the cover of the fax giving the respondent until January 20, 2017 to provide information requested.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. In a letter dated January 17, 2017, the representative for the respondent asked further questions with respect to the procedural issues surrounding the questionnaire.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. Further, the representative the addressed the following issues:
<P1>a. Have the personal tax returns and any other related or associated entities have been selected for audit?<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>

<P1>f. The CRA letter, dated January 20, 2017, with respect to reasonable length of time to comply with the initial letter dated September 16, 2016 is onerous because information is located outside Canada.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>42. Further, the representative requests another six (6) month extension.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. In a letter dated April 5, 2017 the auditor stated in the first paragraph that &ldquo;as outlined previously, the Canada Revenue Agency is in possession of information that indicates that the taxpayers may have offshore interests that they failed to disclose as required by the Income Tax Act. Consequently, they have been selected for audit for the above noted period.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit I and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. The auditor made no reference to sections 231.2 and 231.6 of the Income Tax Act and the letter does not properly explain the consequences of non-compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit I and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>46. According to paragraph 17 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor and the auditor's Team Leader had a telephone conversation with Mr. Hu to discuss the issues raised in his' letter May 4, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Douab Affidavit</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 2, at para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>50. In a letter dated May 19, 2017, the representative for the respondent confirmed the meeting but did not confirm the attendance of the respondent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit L and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 19.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>51. Further, he advised the auditor that he will attend the meeting with the &ldquo;required questionnaire information and documents.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. The auditor stated that his team leader confirmed the June 2, 2017 meeting and expressed their intention to also meet with the respondent.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 20.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. Further, Canada Revenue Agency did not specifically require or demand that the respondent to attend the meeting, and the June 2, 2017 meeting is well beyond the 30 days provided for compliance in the auditor's April 5, 2017 letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. At the meeting, my authorized representative made oral and written submissions on my behalf with respect to my residency status for the purposes of taxation in Canada.</P>
<P>55. Mr. Hu provided a three page written submission &ldquo;Determination of Mr. Xue Lin's Residency for Tax Purpose&rdquo;.</P>
<P>56. At the June 2, 2017 meeting, the auditor provided the respondent with a letter dated June 2, 2017 and the letter was entitled. &ldquo;Re: Audit of your Income Tax Returns for the Period from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015&rdquo;.</P>
<P>57. Further, the letter stated that CRA had conducted a bank deposits and withdrawal analysis and thus requested further details with respect to some transactions that CRA were not able to reconcile.</P>
<P>58. Xue Lin was unable to attend the June 2, 2017 meeting because in China and was working.</P>
<P>59. Lin Lin did not attend the meeting because she was in China providing personal support care for my mother, due to her Alzheimer's condition, and as a result Lin Lin's authorized representative, Sean Hu, and Lin Lin's mother, Min Wang, provided documents from Lin Lin, a completed questionnaire and answered questions verbally on her behalf.</P>
<P>60. The &ldquo;respondent provided a partially answered version of the questionnaire that was attached to the Demand Letter.&rdquo;, and the auditor &ldquo;provided the [R]epresentative with a query and gave the [R]espondent 30 days to respond to it.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 21.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. There is no evidence that any CRA notes were prepared in regards to the June 2, 2017 meeting.</P>
<P>62. Further, CRA did not provide the respondent, nor the respondent's representative, with a receipt for documents that were provided to CRA.</P>
<P>63. In a letter dated May 4, 2017, the respondent requested another extension for two months because (1) the respondent will go back to China in order to prepare the documents and information; and (2) her dog is expected to give birth in a month or so.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit K and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 17.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. The June 20, 2017 letter from CRA provides another extension to August 18, 2016, and referred to &ldquo;requested&rdquo; information, and the letter does not discuss the consequence of non-compliance.</P>
<P>65. In a letter dated July 4, 2017 the representative of the respondent informed the auditor that the September 16, 2016 letter is not enforceable for the following reasons: (1) Unknown taxpayers selected for the audit and required to provide information; (2) Misapplication of the Income Tax Act&mdash;section 231.1; (3) Non-compliance with the Income Tax Act&mdash;section 233.4 of the Income Tax Act; (4) The statutorily barred years&mdash;section 152 of the Income Tax Act; (5) False Representation in the September 16, 2016 letter; and (6) Confusing correspondence from CRA.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit Q and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>66. In particular Sean Hu wanted a response to his written submissions to CRA because it was important to first determine if he is considered a resident of Canada for the purposes of taxation prior to ascertaining if he has any obligation to give any information to CRA pursuant to 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>67. The auditor and the team leader contacted the representative of the respondent to &ldquo;get clarification on his July 4, 2017 letter&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Douab Affidavit</EM>, <EM>supra</EM> note 2 at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>68. The auditor did not attach his notes as an exhibit with respect to the above noted conversation with the respondent's representative.</P>
<P>69. In a letter dated August 4, 2017 the auditor provided a response to the respondent's representative's letter dated July 4, 2017.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit R and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 27.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>70. CRA's letter does not discuss the consequence of 231.7, except that it states it is a civil remedy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>71. In a letter dated August 11, 2017, the representative for the respondent once again advised the auditor of the concerns he has with respect to this audit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit S and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>72. Further, the representative for the respondent asked the auditor &ldquo;what are exactly the documents and information that remain outstanding from your initial letter dated September 16, 2017.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>73. The respondent's representative further stated the following: &ldquo;But what exactly are you demanding as far as your initial letter is concerned? You are talking as if the taxpayers had submitted nothing to you. Do you remember they submitted to you the information for the questionnaire and other documents such as bank statements during the meeting on June 2? They also answered your questions and you took notes.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. Further to the above, the representative for the respondent stated the following:
<QUOTE><P>it is understandable for your initial letter to outline your request in rather general terms before the audit started, but what we do not understand is that, two months after you received the information, you don't seem to have a better idea of what you want and to be able to let us know specifically what document or information is still outstanding based on the information already provided. We don't really see the reasons why you are still insisting on the whole package of your initial request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>75. The auditor did not receive the &ldquo;information requested&rdquo; as per the Demand Letter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 28.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>76. The auditor &ldquo;decided to initiate a request to the Department of Justice to pursue a compliance order pursuant to ss.231.7 of the <EM>ITA</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 29.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>77. The Director of the International and Ottawa Tax Service office sent a letter to the Department of Justice, Tax Law Services, requesting that a compliance order application be pursued in this matter.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM> and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 30.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>78. A letter dated December 1, 2017 from the Department of Justice, Canada referred to the Demand Letter of September 16, 2016 and stated that only four (4) questions from the questionnaire were still unanswered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit T and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 32.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>79. Further, the letter from Department of Justice provided for a final extension to December 20, 2017, and the letter does not explain the consequences of non-compliance.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>80. In a letter dated December 20, 2017, Mr. Hu advised stated that the September 16, 2016 letter is unenforceable since it relates to years beyond the retention period.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Exhibit U and <EM>Douab Affidavit</EM> at para 33.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>81. Further, Mr. Hu states that (1) the available documents were provided at the June 2, 2017 meeting and (2) no receipt was provided for the documents provided.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>82. In particular, he asked the Department of Justice lawyer the same question that he asked the auditor, from the Offshore Compliance Division in the International and Ottawa Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue agency for a response to his repeated request for the determination of Mr. Xue Lin's residency status in Canada for the purpose of section 231.1.</P>
<P>83. The auditor stated that to date, he had still not received all of the books, records, or information as set out in the Demand Letter sent pursuant to ss. 231.1(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>84. Throughout the entirety of correspondence between the auditor and the respondent, &ldquo;books and records&rdquo; were never requested or demanded.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>PART II&mdash;ISSUES</UNDER></TI>
<P>85. The Court must use statutory interpretation in order to ascertain if the Minister has the authority to request information pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>86. The Court must additionally look at the specific facts of this case in order to determine where the issuance of the letter and questionnaire are within the parameters of subsection 231.1(1) of the ITA.</P>
<P>87. Whether CRA can use their audit powers under 231.1 of the ITA prior to the determination of Mr. Xue Lin's tax status in Canada in this case.</P>
<P>88. The respondent has raised the issue whether the Minister is entitled under s.231.7 of the ITA to compel the respondent to provide responses to the September 16, 2016 letter and the questionnaire.</P>
<P>89. The respondent has raised the issue whether the conditions for the issuance of a compliance order under ss. 231.7 of ITA are met in the present case.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI>Minister's power to inspect, audit and examine books, records and property</TI>
<P>90. The Minister of National Revenue must be given broad powers in the supervising this regulatory scheme to audit taxpayers' returns and inspect all records that may relevant to the preparation of those returns.</P>
<P>91. The Minister's argument that &ldquo;inspect, audit and examine&rdquo; in subsection 231.1 includes the authority to request information.</P>
<P>92. Statutory interpretation precludes the Minister from requesting information pursuant to subsection 231.1 because that would ignore the mid-amble of the section that expressly restricts assistance for the purposes of allowing the Minister to &ldquo;inspect, audit or examine&rdquo; the books, records and property of the respondent.</P>
<P>93. Section 231.1(2) of the ITA deals with requirement for information relating to &ldquo;unnamed persons&rdquo;.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><UNDER>PART III&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><TI>How these principles apply to the facts of this instance</TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Temporal Scope of the Compliance Audit</UNDER></TI>
<P>94. With respect to paragraph 4 of the auditor's affidavit, on September 2, 2016, the auditor stated that he was assigned a compliance audit for the years 2006 to 2015. This is unlikely, depending on the initial assessment dates for each of the years. Most of those years were likely statute barred. According to subsection 152(4), CRA can only assess or reassess a return prior to the statute barred date if the CRA had, at the very least, evidence of misrepresentation attributable to negligence, carelessness, or willful default. It is inconsistent for CRA to start an audit of years as far back as above-noted taxation years unless they were confident that they could reassess. This would suggest that they had evidence of neglect, carelessness, or willful default, which generally amounts to a violation of the Income Tax Act before the audit started.</P>
<P>95. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor stated that in order to conduct the audit, he needs to review various books, records and documents. However, none of the documents attached as Exhibits indicate that he ever asked for &ldquo;books and records&rdquo;. The auditor asked for information in the form of the answering of questions that were supplied, and indirectly for documents to support the answers, however there was no mention of the books and records.</P>
<P>96. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the respondent was not was not informed as to what led to the request for information other than &ldquo;Canada Revenue Agency is in possession of information that has led us to determine that you might have offshore holdings that you have failed to disclose as required by the Income Tax Act.&rdquo;</P>
<P>97. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor does not does not use clear language to justify requesting to obtain information from the respondent. The auditor could have simply stated that we are aware that you have foreign bank accounts (please see June 2, 2017 letter from the Minister) and thus we want to &ldquo;inspect, audit or examine&rdquo; your books, records and property pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>98. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the respondent was not aware if the auditor met with or talked to an investigator in the investigations division.</P>
<P>99. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the respondent was not informed as to what the Minister was trying to determine with respect to their correct tax liability under the Act for 2006 to 2015 tax returns.</P>
<P>100. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the Applicant cannot demonstrate that the Requirement for Information was made as a part of an audit of Respondent's 2006 to 2015 taxation years and that the information and documents being sought therein are &ldquo;necessary to confirm the respondent's compliance with the ITA&rdquo;.</P>
<P>101. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the respondent submits that the purpose of the letter and questionnaire was to allow the Minister to engage on a fishing expedition in an attempt to obtain information and thus did not afford the respondent an opportunity to seek legal advice with respect self-incrimination, for example.</P>
<P>102. With respect to paragraph 5 of the auditor's affidavit, the Requirement for Information that was requested was for another purpose other than a tax audit conducted in good faith.</P>
<P>103. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor states that on September 16, 2016 he sent a registered letter to the taxpayer advising Lin Lin of the compliance audit and that the letter included a questionnaire. Section 244(5) states that the affidavit is to include documentary proof of the registration and there is no proof of service for the above-noted registered mail.</P>
<P>104. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor states that on September 16, 2016 he sent a registered letter to the taxpayer advising Lin Lin of the compliance audit and that the letter included a questionnaire. Section 244(5) states that the affidavit is include to documentary proof of the registration and there is no proof of service for the above-noted registered mail.</P>
<P>105. With regard to the first condition, in the case at bar, it is unclear whether 231.1 or 231.2 requirement was addressed to the respondent or any other related or associated entities.</P>
<P>106. The request for information was addressed to Lin Lin in her personal capacity.</P>
<P>107. The fact that the salutation of the request for information was &ldquo;Dear Lin Lin&rdquo; supports the view that the address was to Lin Lin and not any other related or associated entities.</P>
<P>108. It is not clear whether the request, nor requirement, was directed to the respondent personally or any other related or associated entities from which the Minister also seeks information</P>
<P>109. In addition, the threatened penal sanction in the request for information reinforces the position that the request pertained to Ms. Lin in her personal capacity, and not any other related or associated entities, since a corporation cannot be imprisoned.</P>
<P>110. In light of the uncertainty as to whether the request was addressed to Lin Lin or any other related or associated entities, the first condition cannot be said to be satisfied.</P>
<P>111. Section 231.2 of the ITA deals with requests for information relating to &ldquo;unnamed persons&rdquo;, not subsection 231.1 of the ITA.</P>
<P>112. The authority to request information is given in subsection 231.2 (1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, as long as it relates to named persons. In this case, other than the taxpayer, the other persons (entities) are not named, although CRA's letter suggests that they had such information. If CRA wants information on unnamed persons, they need judicial authorization and the reason is to avoid a &ldquo;fishing expedition&rdquo;.</P>
<P>113. Further, it is recognized that the new section (now section 231.2(3)), dealing with requests for information relating to &ldquo;unnamed persons&rdquo;, required a strict interpretation because of its intrusive nature into the right to the protection of private information.</P>
<P>114. Pursuant to subsection 231.2 of the ITA, &ldquo;Any other related or associated entities&rdquo; is not a group that is ascertainable, nor is the information sought in order to make it possible to verify compliance with the Act.</P>
<P>115. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, the request, and not the requirement, for information is broader than a straightforward list because of the words &ldquo;whether or not registered in your name is included in the questionnaire&rdquo;. This choice of language raises a question of whether the respondent is being asked to list his personal assets or to include documentation about corporate assets that he would only have access to in his capacity as a director or officer of a corporation.</P>
<P>116. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor refers to September 16, 2016 registered letter as the &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo; and states that it is issued pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA. The 16 September letter is not a &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo; because the letter only asks for information and makes no statement that a response is &ldquo;required&rdquo;.</P>
<P>117. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, 16 September did not set out the consequences for non-compliance. The letter sent makes no reference to consequences and therefore is only an initial request and not a Demand nor a Requirement.</P>
<P>118. Subsection 231.1 of the ITA states that the auditor is authorized to review certain things, and as noted in this section of the Income Tax Act, relates to books, records, of a business or property of a business, not obtaining information. This is summarized by the subheading <BOLD>&ldquo;Inspections&rdquo;</BOLD> at the beginning of the section. The reference to answering &ldquo;all proper questions&rdquo; relates to asking the owner or manager of the property that has been entered into. In addition, auditors are entitled to be provided with &ldquo;all reasonable assistance&rdquo; in performing their audits (paragraph 231.1(1)(d) of the Act). In this case, no books and records were requested for inspection and thus subsection 231.1(1) does not apply.</P>
<P>119. The procedure used to be first of all, a &ldquo;request&rdquo; would be served on the taxpayer, providing a deadline for the provision of the books and records (ss.231.1) or information or documents (ss.231.2). If the taxpayer did not comply, a &ldquo;demand&rdquo; or &ldquo;requirement&rdquo; letter would be issued with evidence of personal service. This would provide another deadline but would spell out the consequences for non-compliance. If the taxpayer still did not comply, then a recommendation would be made for a charge under section 238 of the ITA.</P>
<P>120. Subsection 238(1) of the Act provides the following:
<P1>a.
<QUOTE><SEC><N>238.</N><SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>Every one who had failed to file or make a return as and when required by or under this Act or a regulation or who has failed to comply with subsection 116(3), 127(3.1) or 127(3.2), 147(7) or 153(1), any of sections 230 to 232 or a regulation made under subsection 147.1 (18) or with an order under subsection 238(2) is guilty of an offence and, in addition to any penalty otherwise provided, is liable on summary conviction to

<PARA><N>ii.</N><PARAP>both the fine described in paragraph 238(1) (a) and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P1></P>
<P>121. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, there can be no formal extensions given in regard to a &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;. If a formal extension is given, there needs to be a new &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;. The fact that numerous extensions were given, supports the fact that at least the original letter was not a &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;.</P>
<P>122. With respect to paragraph 6 of the auditor's affidavit, if it is meant to be a &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo;, it is inconsistent to not use the word &ldquo;require&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;request&rdquo;.</P>
<P>123. With respect to paragraph 9 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor states that in his correspondence to the taxpayer's representative dated November 7, 2016, that he &ldquo;reiterated the demand for the respondent to provide information requested in Demand Letter&rdquo;. Note that he acknowledges that he was asking for &ldquo;information&rdquo; and not &ldquo;books and records&rdquo;.</P>
<P>124. With respect to paragraph 9 of the auditor's affidavit, the letter dated November 7, 2016 states &ldquo;We ask that you please provide information requested as outlined in our initial letter dated September 16, 2016 within 10 days of this letter.&rdquo; Again, no &ldquo;Demand&rdquo;, but a request and no consequence presented if there is non-compliance.</P>
<P>125. With respect to paragraph 11 of the auditor's affidavit, the auditor does not call it a &ldquo;Demand&rdquo; in this paragraph. He refers to &ldquo;the requested information and documents&rdquo;, and provides a formal extension. The reply letter from the auditor again refers to &ldquo;the information requested&rdquo;, not demanded or required. The auditor then said that if the information is not received they will pursue issuing a Compliance Order under ss. 231.7(1), which requires judicial approval. This could be seen to escalate the matter from a Request to an Order, while skipping any actual Demand. In order to take this step, the judge would have to be satisfied that the person was properly <BOLD><UNDER>required</UNDER></BOLD> or <BOLD><UNDER>demanded</UNDER></BOLD>, under section 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document (as applicable) and did not do so.</P>
<P>126. With respect to paragraph 12 of the auditor's affidavit, again the auditor refers to the original letter as a Demand Letter. The questions raised by Mr. Hu dealt with procedural issues concerning the answering of the questions. Mr. Hu also raised the issue of a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; if the request is made under 231.6, which allows for a minimum of 90 days to respond. This seems valid, although the auditor had not actually made the request under that Section. There were also issues about travel to meet with the auditor and a request was made to move the audit to Toronto.</P>
<P>127. With respect to paragraph 13 of the auditor's affidavit, it took the auditor about 4 weeks to reply to the representative. In that reply, the deadline was extended once again, this time to January 20, 2017. On the cover page, the auditor said that this was allowing the taxpayer more than 90 days. He also called the information &ldquo;requested information&rdquo; and the original letter a &ldquo;request letter&rdquo;. He also references the original letter was being dated September 22, 2016, which is not attached as an Exhibit. The response references September 22, 2016 as being the original letter. There is also a reference to an &ldquo;initial letter dated September 16, 2016&rdquo;. The reference is made that the auditor will be pursuing a Compliance Order, although the cover of the fax gives them until January 20<SUP>th</SUP>.</P>
<P>128. With respect to paragraph 14 of the auditor's affidavit, the representative asks further questions and requests a 6-month extension. He raises some valid points and provides reasons for the extension request. The questions again deal with procedural issues surrounding the questionnaire.</P>
<P>129. With respect to paragraph 15 of the auditor's affidavit, it is apparent that some portion of the extension requested was granted since the next letter the auditor refers to is dated April 5, 2017. The auditor makes no reference to a request under subsection 231.2 or 231.6, only 231.1.</P>
<P>130. With respect to paragraph 16 of the auditor's affidavit, the May 4, 2017 letter from the representative raises the issue as to whether the September 16, 2016 letter was addressed to the respondent in his personal capacity, or addressed to a corporation. Because of the uncertainty as to who the letter was addressed to, the criteria in section 231.1 or 231.2 has not been satisfied and in particular raised concerns that the audit was not being properly administered under the Act. As a result, paragraph 231.7(1)(a) has not been satisfied because the entity is not identified. The representative also referred to Section 152 relating to statute barred years and that the taxpayer has no obligation to provide evidence to CRA to satisfy Section 152. At the bottom of the third page, Mr. Hu acknowledges the &ldquo;Demand&rdquo; but questions the authority.</P>
<P>131. With respect to paragraph 17 of the auditor's affidavit, it is noted that both the auditor and his team leader had a telephone conversation with Mr. Hu on May 17, 2017; however, there is no reference to any notes prepared in relation to these conversations and they are not attached as Exhibits.</P>
<P>132. With respect to paragraph 19 of the auditor's affidavit, Exhibit L from Mr. Hu confirms the meeting for June 2, 2017, however, it does not confirm that his clients would be there.</P>
<P>133. With respect to paragraph 20 of the auditor's affidavit, <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD> from the team leader confirms the meeting on June 2, 2017 and voices their intention to also meet with the clients. CRA did not require or demand that the clients be at the meeting. This meeting is well beyond the 30 days provided for compliance in the auditor's April 5, 2017 letter. This nullifies any Demand implied by that letter.</P>
<P>134. With respect to paragraph 21 of the auditor's affidavit, a meeting took place on June 2, 2017 with the auditor, his team leader, and the authorized representative, Sean Hu. There is no evidence that any notes were prepared in regard to their meeting, since they are not referenced nor attached as Exhibits. Therefore, there is nothing to support the apparent further extension to July 4, 2017, other than a reference in the affidavit of an additional 30 days. Once again, this nullifies any prior Demand. There is no record or reference made to what was discussed.</P>
<P>135. The respondent provided responses to the queries on June 2, 2017.</P>
<P>136. At the June 2, 2017 meeting there was no suggestion that CRA found the respondent hesitant and reluctant at times when answering questions and not personally knowledgeable with respect to the questionnaire.</P>
<P>137. The respondent says that he has made significant effort and complied with all requests for the information that is the subject of this application.</P>
<P>138. With respect to paragraph 23 of the auditor's affidavit, the June 20, 2017 letter from CRA refers to &ldquo;requested&rdquo; information, not required information or demanded information. This is another extension, which nullifies the prior requests.</P>
<P>139. With respect to paragraph 24 of the auditor's affidavit, <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD> refers to a July 4, 2017 letter from the respondent's representative in which Sean Hu raised the issue of enforceability of subsection 231.1(1). It cannot be ascertained whether the September 16, 2016 letter was addressed to the respondent in her personal capacity or to unnamed entities. As a result, we cannot ascertain who is the person being referred to in paragraph (a) of section 231.7(1)(a) and addressing that Xue Lin is considered a non-resident for the purposes of taxation.</P>
<P>140. With respect to paragraph 25 of the auditor's affidavit, there should be notes referenced and attached in regard to the conversation on July 7, 2017.</P>
<P>141. With respect to paragraph 26 of the auditor's affidavit, the referenced letter dated August 4, 2017 ignores Mr. Hu's concerns about the non-use of s. 231.2. Note the use of the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; by the auditor, and that in this case no extension was agreed to.</P>
<P>142. With respect to paragraph 27 of the auditor's affidavit, <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo;,</BOLD> the auditor received a letter from Sean Hu in which he requested another face to face meeting in order to clarify the issues as presented in the August 4, 2017 letter. Among many other issues, in the August 11, 2017 letter, Mr. Hu addressed the subject of section 231.1 with regard to the enforceability of the September 16, 2016 letter, the non-residency of Xue Lin, and the confusion surrounding what CRA is requesting of the respondent.</P>
<P>143. With respect to paragraph 31 of the auditor's affidavit, the letter from the Justice Department provided a final extension to December 20, 2017. Reference is made to the &ldquo;Demand Letter&rdquo; of September 16, 2016.</P>
<P>144. With respect to paragraph 32 of the auditor's affidavit, <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo;</BOLD> is a letter from Mr. Hu to the Department of Justice. Mr. Hu states that the available documents were provided at the June 2, 2017 meeting. He also states that no receipt was provided for the documents produced.</P>
<P>145. With respect to paragraph 33 of the auditor's affidavit, books and records were never requested or demanded.</P>
<P>146. With respect to paragraph 34 of the auditor's affidavit, it would be correct that the auditor only does audits and not investigations, however, that does not mean that he was working with an investigator, or in conjunctions with the Investigation Division.</P>
<P>147. It should be kept in mind that the auditor would have had the option of obtaining production orders for any banks that he was aware of through the client's tax returns or third-party information. The auditor could then have proposed to reassess the client on any unexplained amounts deposited into the bank accounts.</P>
<P>148. A letter dated December 1, 2017 indicated that several queries remain outstanding as of December 1, 2017 and continue to be pursued in this application.</P>
<P>149. As of the date of this application, the respondent has provided a satisfactory response to 4 of the queries (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) of the questionnaire.</P></BLOCK4>

<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Statutory Interpretation and Subsection 231.1 of the ITA</UNDER></TI>
<P>150.

<P>151. Subsection 231.1 of the ITA authorizes an auditor to inspect a taxpayer's books, records as they pertain to the business or property of the business. As a result, a taxpayer is obligated to answer all proper questions that relate to the taxpayer's books and records. In addition, auditors are entitled to be provided with &ldquo;all reasonable assistance&rdquo; in performing their audits (paragraph 231. 1(1)(d) of the Act). In this case, no books, records were required for inspection and thus subsection 231.1(1) does not apply.</P>
<P>152. Subsection 231.1 of the ITA states that the auditor is authorized to do certain things and these certain things noted in this section of the Income Tax Act relates to books, records, of a business or property of a business, not obtaining information. This is summarized by the subheading &ldquo;<BOLD>Inspections</BOLD>&rdquo; at the beginning of the section. The reference to answering &ldquo;all proper questions&rdquo; relates to asking the owner or manager of the property that has been entered into. In addition, auditors are entitled to be provided with &ldquo;all reasonable assistance&rdquo; in performing their audits (paragraph 231.1(1)(d) of the Act). In this case, no books and/or records were requested for inspection and thus subsection 231.1(1) does not apply.</P>
<P>153. Statutory interpretation of subsection of 231.1 of the ITA in this specific instance precludes the Minister from requesting information pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA.</P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>Tax Residency</UNDER></TI>
<P>154. Mr. Xue Lin is a resident of China for tax purposes because his &ldquo;central vital interests&rdquo; lie in China or he is deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State of which he is a national of, China.</P>
<P>155. For the abovementioned reason, he is not considered a person &ldquo;required under subsection 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document and did not do so&rdquo; pursuant to paragraph 231.7(a) of the ITA.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><UNDER>The Test of subsection 231.7 of the ITA</UNDER></TI>
<P>156. As set out at paragraph of 231.7 (a) of the ITA, one must ascertain if the respondent is considered a person &ldquo;required under subsection of 231.1&rdquo; of the ITA &ldquo;to provide the access, assistance, information or document&rdquo;.</P>
<P>157. The respondent is not necessarily a person that is required to provide access, assistance, information or documents because the September 16, 2016 letter is not clear whether the request for information was directed to the respondent personally or to various other associations and thus the Court should not exercise it discretion to issue the requested compliance order.</P>
<P>158. Next, as the test is set out at paragraph 231.7(b) of the ITA, one must ascertain if the respondent is &ldquo;required&rdquo; to comply with the Minister's request for information.</P>
<P>159. If the Court determines that the Minister has the authority to request information pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA in this case, the respondent submits that the Applicant has not met its burden to prove that the respondent has not already provided the requested information.</P>
<P>160. In the alternative, if the Court determines that the Minister has the authority to request information pursuant to subsection 231.1 of the ITA and the respondent has not provided satisfactory response to four (4) of the queries (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) of the questionnaire, the respondent will provide information if the CRA make it clear what specific documents are outstanding.</P>
<P>161. The respondent argues that it is not reasonable for the Applicant to seek a compliance order against the respondent when none of the CRA representatives provided the respondent with the necessary information that the CRA representatives had as to what was required in order for the respondent to comply with the queries.</P>
<P>162. The test set out at paragraph 231.7(1)(a) of the ITA is relevant because if the respondent &ldquo;was required under section 231.1 or 231.2 to provide the access, assistance, information or document...&rdquo; but the respondent and the respondent's authorized representative clearly indicated numerous times a lack of understanding as to what remaining outstanding information is required, the respondent would logically be unable to provide it.</P>
<P>163. Thus, the test, which the jurisprudence indicates must be &ldquo;clearly met,&rdquo; has not been fulfilled for the issuance of an order under s.271.1</P>
<P>164. The respondent argues that the Minister had failed to &ldquo;clearly meet&rdquo; her burden to show that the respondent had not already provided the documents or, in the alternative, that the documents will be provided if CRA provides clarification what was specifically outstanding.</P>
<P>165. If CRA requires clarification with respect to four queries, it may make further inquiries, but argues that no basis exists for this Court to make as 231.7 order requiring the production of further information.</P>
<P>166. In the event that the Court is satisfied that the Applicant has &ldquo;clearly met&rdquo; the burden to prove that the respondent was required under 231.1 to provide the information sought by the Applicant, then the respondent submits that the Court ought to exercise its discretion not to issue the order.</P>
<P>167. The test set out at paragraph 231.7(c) of the ITA the information and documents are protected by solicitor-client privilege and the aforementioned paragraph does not apply to the case at bar.</P>
<BLOCK5><TI><UNDER>Potentially Serious Consequences</UNDER></TI>
<P>168. In addition, there are potentially serious consequences that can flow from the failure to obey a compliance order, including fines and/or imprisonment. In light of this, the Court indicated in <CASEREF><SOC>Minister of National Revenue v SML Operations (Canada LTD)</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><CITE>2003 FC 868</CITE></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> that it would not exercise its discretion to order the production of the documents sought by the Minister unless it was satisfied that the statutory conditions of section 231.7 of the <EM>ITA</EM> had been &ldquo;clearly met&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid.</EM> at para 15.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
