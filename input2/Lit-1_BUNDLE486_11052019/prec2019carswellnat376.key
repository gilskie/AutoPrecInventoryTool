<BLOCK1><TI><UNDER>APPLICATION</UNDER></TI>
<P>This is an application for judicial review, pursuant to s. 18 and 18.1 of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, in respect of a decision made by Mr. L. Beck, Team Leader at the Taxpayer Relief Centre of Expertise, Appeals Branch of the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CRA</BOLD>&rdquo;), who, acting on behalf of the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Minister</BOLD>&rdquo;), on July 19, 2017, denied the Applicant's request dated May 4, 2017 for the following relief pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD>IT</BOLD>A&rdquo;):
<P1>A. The Cancellation of interest for the 2002 taxation year from January 01, 2006 to May 1, 2008 and March 5, 2013 to October 5, 2016;</P1>
<P1>B. The Cancellation of interest for the 2003 taxation year from January 01, 2006 to May 1, 2008 and June 25, 2011 to October 5, 2016; and</P1>
<P1>C. No agreement to waive any interest that would otherwise accrue on the 2002 and 2003 tax years starting on May 25, 2016.</P1></P>
<P>The Applicant makes an application pursuant to s. 18 and 18.1 of the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM> to seek the following orders:
<P1>A. An order referring the matter back to the Minister to redetermine CRA's decision of July 19, 2017 to not grant the requested relief on its merits and that such redetermination be carried out by a person or persons previously uninvolved with the tax affairs of the Applicant, his wife, or Thomson 28 Co. Ltd. (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Corporation</BOLD>&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>B. An order for the reasonable and proper costs of this Application as this Honourable Court in its discretion may award; and</P1>
<P1>C. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may deem just.</P1></P>
<P>The grounds for the application are:
<QUOTE><BLOCK1><TI><EM>First Notice of Objection</EM></TI>
<P>1. On February 1, 2008, the Applicant was assessed by the CRA under s. 152(7) of the ITA for the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</P>
<P>2. On May 2, 2008, the Applicant's then lawyer&mdash;Mr. John David Boute&mdash;filed an Application for an Extension of Time to file a Notice of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 tax years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>First Objection</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. At the time of filing the First Objection, the Applicant requested that this matter be held in abeyance pending the resolution of his appeal in the Tax Court of Canada for the 1999 to 2001 tax years on the grounds that there were common issues in all of the years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>TCC Appeal</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. On February 18, 2009, the appeals officer assigned to the file, Ms. Alice Tao (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Tao</BOLD>&rdquo;), requested that the Applicant prepare and submit T1 income tax returns for the 2002 tax year for her review.</P>
<P>5. On June 25, 2009, a Notice of Confirmation was issued for the 2002 tax year (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Confirmation</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Tax Court of Canada Decision for 1999 to 2001</EM></TI>
<P>6. On November 20, 2009, the Tax Court of Canada rendered its decision with respect to the TCC Appeal.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Second Notice of Objection</EM></TI>
<P>7. On April 8, 2010, a Consequential Reassessment for the 2002 tax year was issued as a result of the decision in the TCC Appeal.</P>
<P>8. On June 24, 2011, the Applicant's new lawyer&mdash;Mr. Nick Ranieri&mdash;filed an Application for an Extension of Time to file a Notice of Objection for the 1999 to 2003 and 2009 tax years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Objection</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>ITA s. 165(1.2) Applied to 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>9. On January 4, 2012, the CRA acknowledged receipt of the Second Objection and refused to accept the objection for the 2002 tax year citing the application of ITA s. 165(1.2).</P1>
<P1>10. On August 10, 2012, an appeals officer&mdash;Ms. Maryam Aman (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Aman</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;requested particulars in respect of the Applicant's objection for the 2009 tax year only.</P1>
<P1>11. On December 19, 2012, a new appeals officer&mdash;Ms. Hanaa Farag (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Farag</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;was assigned to the Second Objection.</P1>
<P1>12. On January 14, 2013, Mr. Ranieri wrote to Appeals Officer Farag stating that ITA s. 165(1.2) was inapplicable to the Applicant's 2002 tax year.</P1>
<P1>13. On January 15, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag wrote to Mr. Ranieri to request further information and explanations.</P1>
<P1>14. On February 1, 2013, Mr. Ranieri in response to Appeals Officer Farag's January 15, 2013 letter, again repeated his submission that ITA s. 165(1.2) was not applicable to the Applicant's 2002 tax year.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>ITA s. 165(1.2) Inapplicable to 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>15. On March 5, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag wrote to the Applicant and finally informed him that the CRA was now in agreement with him. They agreed that the objection for the 2002 tax year was valid as a result of a consequential reassessment stemming from the TCC Appeal.</P1>
<P1>16. On April 10, 2013, Mr. Ranieri submitted the Applicant's T1 income tax returns for the 2002 tax year to Appeals Officer Farag by fax.</P1>
<P1>17. On April 12, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag provided Mr. Ranieri with a final summary of the Notices of Objection for the 1999 through 2002 tax years.</P1>
<P1>18. On February 3, 2014, the Applicant filed a request for a reassessment pursuant to ITA s. 152(4.2) for the 2002 tax year.</P1>
<P1>19. On May 5, 2014, Appeals Officer Aman wrote to the Applicant requesting that he provide supporting documentation with respect to the 2002 tax year.</P1>
<P1>20. On June 4, 2014, Mr. Ranieri provided Appeals Officer Aman with financial statements indicating the Applicant's pay in the 2002 tax year.</P1>
<P1>21. On the same day, Mr. Ranieri wrote to Appeals Officer Aman to provide written confirmation of the Applicant's position with respect to the 2002 tax year.</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>First Taxpayer Relief Request Filed</EM></TI>
<P>22. On July 3, 2014, the Applicant filed a Request for Taxpayer Relief for the 2002 tax year on the basis that the CRA had made a delay in processing his objection and that the Applicant's then lawyer, Mr. Boute, had misinformed him about filing an appeal for the 2003 tax year (the &ldquo;<BOLD>First Relief Request</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Second Notice of Objection Allowed in Part</EM></TI>
<P>23. On July 24, 2014, the CRA allowed the Applicant's 2002 tax year objection in part.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Second Taxpayer Relief Request Filed</EM></TI>
<P>24. On May 7, 2015, the CRA rejected the First Relief Request for the following reasons:
<P1>a. a history of non-compliance with his tax obligations;</P1>
<P1>b. a balance had knowingly been allowed to exist on which arrears interest had accrued;</P1>
<P1>c. a reasonable amount of care had not been exercised; and</P1>
<P1>d. actions were not taken to quickly remedy any delay or omission.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Third Taxpayer Relief Request Filed</EM></TI>
<P>25. On May 25, 2016, TaxChambers LLP filed, on behalf of the Applicant, another Taxpayer Relief Request (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Third Relief Request</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>26. The Third Relief Request asked for two types of relief:
<P1>a. the cancellation of interest that accrued from May 25, 2006 to May 25, 2016 on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years; and</P1>
<P1>b. the waiver of all future interest on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</P1></P>
<P>27. On December 05, 2016, the CRA responded to the Third Relief Request as follows:
<P1>a. Arrears interest for the 2002 tax year was cancelled for the period between June 24, 2011 and March 06, 2013 due to possible CRA delay (&ldquo;<BOLD>Third Request Decision</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>b. All other requested relief was denied. In particular:
<P2>i. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from January 01, 2006 to June 24, 2011;</P2>
<P2>ii. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from March 5, 2013 to October 5, 2016;</P2>
<P2>iii. no relief was granted for the 2003 tax year from January 01, 2006 to the present; and</P2>
<P2>iv. no agreement to waive any interest that would otherwise accrue on the 2002 and 2003 tax years starting on May 25, 2016.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI><EM>Second Level Review of Third Relief Request</EM></TI>
<P>28. On May 4, 2017, TaxChambers LLP filed, on behalf of the Applicant, a second level review of the Third Request Decision (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Level Review Request</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P>
<P>29. The Second Level Review Request asked for two types of relief:
<P1>a. the cancellation of interest that accrued in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years for the following periods:
<P2>i. from May 25, 2006 to June 24, 2011; and</P2>
<P2>ii. from March 6, 2013 to the present date.</P2></P1>
<P1>b. The waiver of all future interest on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</P1></P>
<P>30. On July 19, 2017, CRA responded to the Second Level Review request as follows:
<P1>a. Arrears interest for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years were cancelled for the period between May 2, 2008 and June 24, 2011 due to the actions of CRA (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Level Review Response</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>b. All other requested relief was denied. In particular:
<P2>i. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from January 01, 2006 to May 1, 2008;</P2>
<P2>ii. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from March 5, 2013 to October 5, 2016;</P2>

<P>I, Robert Jewett of the City of Mississauga and Province of Ontario, <BOLD>SWEAR THAT</BOLD>:
<P1>1. I am the Applicant in this matter. As such, I have personal knowledge of the matters herein deposed to, save and except where stated to be on information from others, and where so stated, I believe that information to be true.</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>First Notice of Objection</TI>
<P>2. On February 01, 2008, I was assessed by the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Minister</BOLD>&rdquo;) under s. 152(7) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (R.S.C., 1985 c. 1 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Supp.), the &ldquo;<BOLD>ITA</BOLD>&rdquo;) for the 2002 and 2003 tax years (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>3. On May 02, 2008, my then lawyer&mdash;Mr. John David Boute&mdash;filed an Application for an Extension of Time to file a Notice of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 tax years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>First Objection</BOLD>&rdquo;, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>4. At the time of filing the First Objection, Mr. Boute requested that this matter be held in abeyance pending the resolution of my appeal in the Tax Court of Canada for the 1999 to 2001 tax years on the grounds that there were common issues in all of the years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>TCC Appeal</BOLD>&rdquo;, see Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;).</P>
<P>5. On February 18, 2009, the appeals officer assigned to my file, Ms. Alice Tao (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Tao</BOLD>&rdquo;), requested that I prepare and submit T1 income tax returns for the 2002 tax year for her review (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>6. On June 25, 2009, the Minister issued Notice of Confirmation for my 2002 tax year (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Confirmation</BOLD>&rdquo;, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>Tax Court of Canada Decision for 1999 to 2001</TI>
<P>7. On November 20, 2009, the Tax Court of Canada rendered its decision with respect to the TCC Appeal (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>Second Notice of Objection</TI>
<P>8. On April 08, 2010, a consequential reassessment for the 2002 tax year was issued as a result of the decision in the TCC Appeal (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>9. On June 24, 2011, my new lawyer&mdash;Mr. Nick Ranieri&mdash;filed an Application for an Extension of Time to file a Notice of Objection for the 1999 to 2003 and 2009 tax years (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Objection</BOLD>&rdquo;, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>ITA s. 165(1.2) Applied to 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>10. On January 04, 2012, the Canada Revenue Agency (the &ldquo;<BOLD>CRA</BOLD>&rdquo;) acknowledged receipt of the Second Objection and refused to accept the objection for the 2002 tax year citing the application of ITA s. 165(1.2) (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit</BOLD> &ldquo;H&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>11. On August 10, 2012, an appeals officer&mdash;Ms. Maryam Aman (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Aman</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;requested particulars in respect of my objection for the 2009 tax year only (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>12. On December 19, 2012, a new appeals officer&mdash;Ms. Hanaa Farag (&ldquo;<BOLD>Appeals Officer Farag</BOLD>&rdquo;)&mdash;was assigned to the Second Objection (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>13. On January 14, 2013, Mr. Ranieri wrote to Appeals Officer Farag stating that ITA s. 165(1.2) was inapplicable to my 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;K&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>14. On January 15, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag wrote to Mr. Ranieri to request further information and explanations (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>15. On February 01, 2013, Mr. Ranieri in response to Appeals Officer Farag's January 15, 2013 letter, again repeated his submission that ITA s. 165(1.2) was not applicable to my 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI><EM>ITA s. 165(1.2) Inapplicable to 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>16. On March 5, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag informed me that the CRA was now in agreement with me. They agreed that the objection for the 2002 tax year was valid as a result of a consequential reassessment stemming from the TCC Appeal (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>17. On April 10, 2013, Mr. Ranieri submitted my T1 income tax returns for the 2002 tax year to Appeals Officer Farag by fax (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>18. I acknowledge Exhibit &ldquo;O&rdquo; appears incomplete as it only has page 1 of my 2003 T1 income tax return. However, it is my understanding that the CRA was already in possession of my 2003 T1 returns at the time of Mr. Ranieri's letter dated April 10, 2013 as a copy of said return dated March 20, 2012 was found in an <EM>Access to Information Act</EM> disclosure from the CRA made to me on June 14, 2016 (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;P&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>19. On April 12, 2013, Appeals Officer Farag provided Mr. Ranieri with a final summary of the Notices of Objection for the 1999 through 2002 tax years (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>20. On February 03, 2014, Mr. Ranieri filed a request for a reassessment pursuant to ITA s. 152(4.2) for my 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit</BOLD> &ldquo;R&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>21. On May 05, 2014, Appeals Officer Aman requested that I provide supporting documentation with respect to the 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;S&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>22. On June 04, 2014, Mr. Ranieri provided Appeals Officer Aman with financial statements indicating my pay in the 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;T&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1>
<P1>23. On the same day, Mr. Ranieri wrote to Appeals Officer Aman to provide written confirmation of my position with respect to the 2002 tax year (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P1></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>First Taxpayer Relief Request Filed</TI>
<P>24. On July 03, 2014, I filed a Request for Taxpayer Relief for the 2002 tax year on the basis that the CRA had made a delay in processing my objection and that my then lawyer, Mr. Boute, had misinformed me about filing an appeal for the 2003 tax year (the &ldquo;<BOLD>First Relief Request</BOLD>&rdquo;, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;V&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>Second Notice of Objection Allowed in Part</TI>
<P>25. On July 24, 2014, the CRA allowed my 2002 tax year objection in part (attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;W&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>CRA Response to the First Taxpayer Relief Request</TI>
<P>26. On May 07, 2015, the CRA rejected the First Relief Request for the following reasons:
<P1>a. a history of non-compliance with my tax obligations;</P1>
<P1>b. a balance had knowingly been allowed to exist on which arrears interest had accrued;</P1>
<P1>c. a reasonable amount of care had not been exercised; and</P1>
<P1>d. actions were not taken to quickly remedy any delay or omission.
<P2>(May 07, 2015 CRA letter attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;X&rdquo;</BOLD>)</P2></P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>Second Taxpayer Relief Request Filed</TI>
<P>27. On May 25, 2016, TaxChambers LLP filed, on behalf of myself, another Taxpayer Relief Request (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Relief Request</BOLD>&rdquo;, attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Y&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>28. The Second Relief Request asked for two types of relief:
<P1>a. the cancellation of interest that accrued from May 25, 2006 to May 25, 2016 on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years; and</P1>
<P1>b. the waiver of all future interest on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</P1></P>
<P>29. On December 05, 2016, the CRA responded to the Second Relief Request as follows:
<P1>a. Arrears interest for the 2002 tax year was cancelled for the period between June 24, 2011 and March 06, 2013 due to possible CRA delay (&ldquo;<BOLD>Second Request Decision</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>b. All other requested relief was denied. In particular:
<P2>i. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from January 01, 2006 to June 24, 2011;</P2>
<P2>ii. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from March 5, 2013 to October 5, 2016;</P2>
<P2>iii. no relief was granted for the 2003 tax year from January 01, 2006 to the present; and</P2>
<P2>iv. no agreement to waive any interest that would otherwise accrue on the 2002 and 2003 tax years starting on May 25, 2016.</P2></P1>
<P1>(December 05, 2016 CRA letter attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;Z&rdquo;</BOLD>)</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI>Second Level Review of Second Relief Request</TI>
<P>30. On May 04, 2017, TaxChambers LLP filed, on behalf of myself, a second level review of the Second Request Decision (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Level Review Request</BOLD>&rdquo; attached hereto and marked as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;AA&rdquo;</BOLD>).</P>
<P>31. The Second Level Review Request asked for two types of relief:
<P1>a. the cancellation of interest that accrued in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years for the following periods:
<P2>i. from May 25, 2006 to June 24, 2011; and</P2>
<P2>ii. from March 6, 2013 to the present date.</P2></P1>
<P1>b. the waiver of all future interest on any balance in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years.
<P2>(See Exhibit &ldquo;AA&rdquo;)</P2></P1></P>
<P>32. On July 19, 2017, the CRA responded to the Second Level Review request as follows:
<P1>a. Arrears interest for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years were cancelled for the period between May 2, 2008 and June 24, 2011 due to the actions of the CRA (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Second Level Review Response</BOLD>&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>b. All other requested relief was denied. In particular:
<P2>i. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from January 01, 2006 to May 1, 2008;</P2>
<P2>ii. no relief was granted for the 2002 tax year from March 5, 2013 to October 5, 2016;</P2>

<P2>iv. no relief was granted for the 2003 tax year from June 25, 2011 to October 5, 2016;and</P2>
<P2>v. no agreement to waive any interest that would otherwise accrue on the 2002 and 2003 tax years starting on May 25, 2016.</P2></P1>

<BLOCK1><TI>AFFIDAVIT</TI>
<P>I, Tracey MacGregor, of the City of Summerside, in the Province of Prince Edward Island, MAKE OATH AND SAY:</P>
<P>1. I am a Taxpayer Relief Officer, Appeals Branch, at the Prince Edward Island Tax Centre of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and as such have personal knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to, save and except what is stated to be on information and belief, and where so stated, I verily believe them to be true. Where I refer to information herein without expressly disclosing the source, the information was derived from my review of the CRA records for the applicant, Robert Jewett.</P>
<BLOCK2><TI>Taxpayer Relief Provisions</TI>
<P>2. Pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;), the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;) has discretion to waive interest or penalties (&ldquo;Taxpayer Relief&rdquo;). The Minister's discretion in respect of Taxpayer Relief is exercised by officials at the CRA with the requisite delegated authority.</P>
<P>3. Ms. Lori Beck, Team Leader, Taxpayer Relief Centre of Expertise, Appeals Branch, at the Prince Edward Island Tax Centre, is one of the CRA officials with the requisite delegated authority to exercise the Minister's discretion in respect of Taxpayer Relief. I am an officer in Ms. Beck's team.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>First Request for Relief and Decision</TI>
<P>4. In May 2016, the applicant made a request to the Minister for Taxpayer Relief for waiver of interest and penalties in respect of his 2002 and 2003 taxation years. The request was received by the Minister on May 30, 2016.</P>
<P>5. Upon receiving the applicant's request, John Asche, an officer of the Taxpayer Relief Centre of Expertise, Appeals Branch at the Vancouver Tax Services Office (TSO) was designated to conduct a review of the request and to prepare a report for review by the ultimate decision maker. Mr. Asche prepared a report wherein he set out his review of the facts and his recommendations with respect to the applicant's request. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of Mr. Asche's report.</P>
<P>6. Shelley O'Connor, a team leader of the Taxpayer Relief Centre of Expertise, Appeals Branch at the Vancouver TSO, was a CRA officer with requisite delegated authority to exercise the Minister's discretion in respect of Taxpayer Relief, and the ultimate decision maker in respect of the applicant's request. She agreed with Mr. Asche's recommendations and made the decision to partially approve the applicant's request for Taxpayer Relief. Attached as hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the letter from Ms. O'Connor to Robert Jewett, dated December 5, 2016, advising him that his request for Taxpayer Relief has been partially approved.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI>Second Request for Relief, Review of Request and Decision</TI>
<P>7. In May 2017, the applicant made a request for the Minister to reconsider Ms. O'Connor's decision with respect to his request for Taxpayer Relief for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years. The request was received by the Minister on May 4, 2017 (the &ldquo;Second Review Request&rdquo;).</P>
<P>8. I was the officer designated to review the Second Review Request and to prepare a report with my recommendations for review by the ultimate decision maker. Attached as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of my report.</P>
<P>9. In making my recommendations with respect to the Second Review Request, I carefully reviewed the following documents and information:
<P1>a. the CRA records for the applicant referenced or relied upon in my report;</P1>
<P1>b. the correspondence related to the applicant; and</P1>
<P1>c. the applicant's materials and submissions in the request dated May 4, 2017;</P1>
attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the CRA OP N.4 printouts (CRA electronic records for taxpayer's history of filings, reassessments and payments) in respect of Robert Jewett's 2002 taxation year. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of the CRA OP N.4 printouts (CRA electronic records for taxpayer's history of filings, reassessments and payments) in respect of Robert Jewett's 2003 taxation year. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;F&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies CRA Enforcement Action History printouts (&ldquo;SUDS&rdquo;) in respect of Robert Jewett's 2002 and 2003 taxation years. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of CRA list of correspondence issued to Robert Jewett from Revenue Collections printout (&ldquo;REMITS&rdquo;). Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;</BOLD> are copies of CRA collections diary printouts (&ldquo;ACSES&rdquo;) in respect of Robert Jewett ranging from the beginning of January 2003 to the end of December 2016. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;</BOLD> are reproductions of correspondence from CRA electronic records (&ldquo;ELCS&rdquo;) in respect of Robert Jewett.</P>
<P>10. After my review of the documents and information, I recommended granting relief of the arrears interest assessed on the applicant's 2002 and 2003 taxation years from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011, due to CRA delay.</P>
<P>11. In coming to my recommendation for granting the applicant partial interest relief, I considered carefully the circumstances of the applicant, and concluded that the applicant was prevented from meeting his payment obligations due to some CRA delay, and in particular:
<ITEM><P>on May 2, 2008, the applicant served his request for an extension of time to file objections to the Minister's reassessments for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>on August 20, 2008, the applicant served his objections to the Minister's reassessments for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>on February 18, 2009, CRA acknowledge receipt of the applicant's objections for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>on or about October 26, 2009, CRA closed the file for the applicant's objections for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years;</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>in May/June 2010, CRA officers incorrectly advised the applicant, in writing and verbally in a telephone call, that the applicant's objections for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years remained active and under review; and</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>on June 24, 2011, the applicant served second objections for his 2002 and 2003 taxation years.</P></ITEM></P>
<P>12. In coming to my recommendation for granting the applicant partial interest relief, I also confirmed and considered the fact that the applicant has been granted relief of the arrears interest assessed on his 2002 and 2003 taxation years from June 24, 2011, to March 5, 2013, due to CRA delay pursuant to his first request for Taxpayer Relief.</P>
<P>13. My recommendations with respect to the Second Review Request was submitted for review by Mr. Dean Rush and Ms. Beck. Mr. Rush and Ms. Beck agreed with my recommendation to grant partial interest relief. The decision and reasons were communicated to the applicant by letter. Attached hereto as <BOLD>Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;</BOLD> is a copy of the letter from Lori Beck to Robert Jewett dated July 19, 2017.</P>

<P>1. On July 19, 2017, the Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;<BOLD>Minister</BOLD>&rdquo;) partially granted the Applicant's request to cancel interest under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM> (the &ldquo;<BOLD><EM>ITA</EM></BOLD>&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>2. On July 19, 2017, the Minister cancelled interest that had accrued between May 2, 2008, and June 24, 2011, for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years.</P>
<P>3. The Minister had previously cancelled interest from June 24, 2011, to March 5, 2013, for the 2002 taxation year as a result of the Applicant's first Taxpayer Relief Request dated May 25, 2016.</P>
<P>4. The Applicant submits that the Minister's July 19, 2017, decision to not cancel additional interest for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years was an unreasonable exercise of the Minister's discretion.</P>
<P>5. The Applicant's request for relief was based on having experienced significant CRA delays in the processing of his T1 Income Tax Returns and Notices of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years.</P>
<P>6. The Applicant submits that the Minister's delegate based her decision on a gross misapprehension of the facts as to the existence and cause of the said delays experienced by the Applicant.</P>
<P>7. Additionally, the Applicant submits that the Minister's decision was unreasonable upon a fair understanding of the events that transpired in the processing of his T1 Income Tax Returns and Notices of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years.</P></BLOCK1>

<P>36. The issue raised in this Application is
<P1>a. was the Minister's decision dated July 19, 2017 to not exercise her discretion pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>ITA</EM> unreasonable?</P1></P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>PART III: SUBMISSIONS</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK2><N>(a)</N><TI>Standard of Review</TI>
<P>37. According to the Supreme Court of Canada's (the &ldquo;<BOLD>SCC</BOLD>&rdquo;) decision in <CASEREF><SOC>New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir</SOC></CASEREF> (&ldquo;<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>&rdquo;), there are two standards of review utilized to review administrative exercises of discretion, correctness and reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>45</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. Furthermore, where a standard of review hsas previously been already determined in the jurisprudence, then that previously determined standard is the appropriate standard of review.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>62</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The applicable standard of review for decisions made by the Minister pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>ITA</EM> is that of reasonableness.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Telfer v Canada Revenue Agency</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 23</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF>, and <CASEREF><SOC>Easton v Canada (Revenue Agency)</SOC><CITE>2017 FC 113</CITE><PARANUM>41</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. Decisions reviewed on the reasonableness standard will be concerned with &ldquo;the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision making process&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>; <EM>Telfer</EM> at para 25.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(b)</N><TI>Lack of Justification, Transparency, and Intelligibility within Decision Making Process</TI>
<P>40. The Minister's July 19, 2017 decision was based upon the recommendations prepared by Ms. Tracey MacGregor, a CRA delegated official who reviewed the Applicant's Second Level Review Request.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, at para 8.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. Ms. MacGregor's understanding of the facts and circumstances during the decision making process of the Applicant's request can be found in Taxpayer Relief Fact Sheet in Section III under the heading &ldquo;Describe the circumstances that prevented the taxpayer from meeting their tax obligations. Were they beyond the taxpayer's control?&rdquo; (&ldquo;<BOLD>Fact Sheet&mdash;Circumstances &amp; Control</BOLD>&rdquo;)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, at p. 3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P>
<P>42. Ms. MacGregor has stated in her Affidavit that &ldquo;In making my recommendations with respect to the Second Review Request, I carefully reviewed the following documents and information...&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, at para 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, a review of the Fact Sheet&mdash;Circumstances &amp; Control shows that it is rife with error and misunderstanding as to fundamental facts.</P>
<P>43. As Ms. MacGregor's recommendations were based upon Fact Sheet&mdash;Circumstances &amp; Control, her decision process was premised upon a fundamentally factually erroneous basis.</P>
<P>44. Factual errors and misunderstandings in the Fact Sheet&mdash;Circumstances &amp; Control document include the following which can be found at paragraph 4:
<P1>a. &ldquo;On June 24, 2011, the authorized representative filed a second objection for the 2002 and 2003 tax years; however, on January 4, 2012, it was denied on the reasons that a taxpayer can not [<EM>sic</EM>] object to an arbitrary assessment.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit C, at p. 3</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.
<P2>i. The Notice of Objection filed on June 24, 2011 was for the 1999 to 2003 and 2009 taxation years, not just for the Applicant's 2002 and 2003 taxation year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit G</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> By narrowly defining the Notice of Objection just the 2002 and 2003 taxation years, Ms. MacGregor has overlooked the fact that at the time the Applicant filed this Notice of Objection, he was dealing with a more complicated fact pattern than just the 2002 and 2003 taxation years.</P2>
<P2>ii. The Notice of Objection for 2002 and 2003 was not denied because &ldquo;a taxpayer can not [<EM>sic</EM>] object to an arbitrary assessment&rdquo;. The Minister initially denied the Notice of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years because &ldquo;In accordance with subsection 165(1.2) of the ITA, no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment in respect of an issue for which the right of objection has been waived in writing under subsection 169(3)&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit H</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This mischaracterization confuses what was a central issue in the delay in processing the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years, which was that the CRA had erroneously cited the application of subsection 165(1.2) of the <EM>ITA</EM> as a bar to accepting the Applicant's Notice of Objection.</P2></P1>
<P1>b. &ldquo;Amended Returns for 2002 and 2003 were then received on March 16, 2012, with no supporting documents or schedules; therefore original returns were requested on March 5, 2013.&rdquo;
<P2>i. The 2002 and 2003 T1 Income Tax Returns that were filed on March 16, 2012, and they contained all of the schedules required to process such returns.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit P.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This misunderstanding characterizes the Applicant in a negative light, when he in fact he had provided the information when required to do so.</P2>
<P2>ii. The 2002 and 2003 T1 Income Tax Returns that were filed were not amended returns, but original returns as the Applicant had not previously filed T1 Income Tax Returns for these two years.</P2>
<P2>iii. &ldquo;original returns&rdquo; were not requested on March 5, 2013.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit N.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Instead, the March 5, 2013 letter was the first time in which the CRA acknowledged that the Notice of Objection for the 2002 taxation year was valid. Up to that point, Mr. Ranieri had been providing submissions to CRA as to why the Notices of Objection for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years were valid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibits K and M</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Until that preliminary issue was settled, no attention could be devoted to resolving the substantive portion of the Applicant's Notice of Objection.</P2></P1>
<P1>c. &ldquo;In a letter to the taxpayer on April 12, 2013, the appeals officer explained that the 2002 tax year would be reassessed an increase of income due to the court decision for the 1999 to 2001 tax years.&rdquo;
<P2>i. The April 12, 2013 letter from Ms. Farag explains how the reassessments for the 1999 to 2002 taxation years were issued, not how they <EM>will be</EM> issued.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit Q.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This further demonstrates how Ms. MacGregor misunderstood what happened with respect to the Applicant's file during this process.</P2></P1>
<P1>d. &ldquo;On December 6, 2013, the T1 adjustments were denied as the arbitrary assessments were being held up by appeals; therefore; reassessments could not be considered.&rdquo;
<P2>i. On March 5, 2013, Ms. Farag had already indicated to Mr. Ranieri that the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2003 taxation year was invalid. As such, it is unclear how the Minister could, on the one hand, deny processing the Applicant's return for the 2003 taxation year because it was being &ldquo;held up by appeals&rdquo; and on the other hand, have the CRA Appeals Division state that the 2003 Notice of Objection was invalid. This letter only perpetuated the confusion that the Applicant and his representatives had with respect to the validity of the 2003 Notice of Objection.</P2>
<P2>ii. Secondly, if the returns that were filed for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years were being &ldquo;held up by appeals&rdquo;, the CRA Appeals Division must have had an opportunity to have review the 2002 and 2003 T1 income tax returns that had been filed by the Applicant on March 16, 2012. However, there is nothing in the materials provided by the Respondent pursuant to the Applicant's request made pursuant to Rule 317 of the <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM> or the Affidavit of Ms. MacGregor that would indicate at what point in time after March 16, 2012 the CRA Appeals Division would have began to look at the 2002 and 2003 T1 Income Tax Returns. It does not appear as if Ms. MacGregor apprised herself of the facts as to what was actually happening within the CRA during this period of time, despite there being multiple requests and officers all working on the Applicant's matter.</P2></P1>
<P1>e. &ldquo;The Appeals Officer issued the taxpayer a letter on May 5, 2014, requesting the 2002 original return be submit by June 5, 2014&rdquo;.
<P2>i. The May 5, 2014 letter is a request for &ldquo;related schedules and any supporting documentation&rdquo; with respect to the 2002 taxation year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit S</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>ii. The May 5, 2014 letter confirms that the Applicant had already provided the Agency with an amended T1 Return for 2002.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit S</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>iii. The May 5, 2014 letter itself contains its own error in that it states that the applicant has not provided the related schedules.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit S.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> However, the Applicant had already provided the T1 Income Tax Returns, with the related schedules, on two occasions&mdash;March 16, 2012 and April 10, 2013.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit O and Exhibit P.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2>
<P2>iv. There is no indication in the record why no CRA Appeals Officer communicated with Mr. Ranieri until over a year after his April 10, 2013 fax other than to explain how the disputed 2002 Notice of Reassessment originated. These unexplained CRA delays were the heart of the Applicant's request for taxpayer relief that were overlooked by Ms. MacGregor due to her misunderstanding of the facts.</P2></P1>
<P1>f. &ldquo;The 2002 return was received on June 4, 2014, and the 2002 objection was allowed and $154,000 in income was cancelled on September 5, 2014.&rdquo;
<P2>i. On June 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 2014, Mr. Ranieri submitted two faxes to Ms. Aman. The first fax contained financial statements, not a tax return, as supporting documentation<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit T.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>. The second fax contained submissions explaining why the financial statements support the Applicant's position.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit U.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P2></P1></P>
<P>45. Furthermore, Ms. MacGregor's lack of clear understanding of the facts is readily apparent even in her Affidavit, where in paragraph 12 she states that &ldquo;In coming to my recommendation for granting the applicant partial interest relief, I also confirmed and considered the fact that the applicant has been granted relief of the arrears interest assessed on his 2002 and 2003 taxation years from June 24, 2011 to March 5, 2013, due to CRA delay pursuant to his first request for Taxpayer Relief.&rdquo;<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, para. 12.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This statement is incorrect because according to the CRA's original December 5, 2016 decision letter, such interest relief was limited to 2002 only and was not allowed with respect to the 2003 taxation year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><N>(c)</N><TI>Outcome Indefensible In Respect of the Facts</TI>
<P>46. The Applicant submits that July 19, 2017 decision was an outcome indefensible in respect of the facts.</P>
<P>47. IC07-1 <EM>Taxpayer Relief Provisions</EM> (&ldquo;<BOLD>IC07-1</BOLD>&rdquo;) set out the conditions where the Minister will exercise discretion under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>ITA</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, <EM>Taxpayer Relief Provisions</EM>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>
<QUOTE><P>g. IC07-1 (of which subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>ITA</EM> is included) allows the CRA to help taxpayers to resolve issues that come up through no fault of their own.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, at para 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>h. Paragraph 26 of IC07-1 states that penalties and interest may also be waived or cancelled if they resulted mainly because of actions of the CRA, such as (c) incorrect information provided to a taxpayer or (f) undue delays in resolving an objection or an appeal, or in completing an audit.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, at para 26.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>48. As noted above, the Applicant was granted interest relief for the 2002 taxation year for the period June 24, 2011 to December March 5, 2013.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit B.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The basis for this relief was due to the fact that the Applicant's representative, Mr. Ranieri, received communication from the CRA indicating that the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2002 taxation year was invalid, when it was not actually invalid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit B, pages 1 and 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. However, the Minister did not find that there was any CRA delay in processing the Applicant's objection for the 2002 taxation year after March 5, 2013 or with respect to the 2003 taxation year after June 24, 2011 at either the first Taxpayer Relief Request or the Second Level Review Request. The Applicant submits that this decision is unreasonable because it is not defensible in respect of the facts, as the following delays did occur:
<QUOTE><P>i. Delay #1: between March 6, 2013 to May 5, 2014 for the 2002 taxation year:
<P1>i. The processing of the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2002 taxation year was marred by delay and confusion upon its filing in June, 2011.</P1>
<P1>ii. The Minister admitted its delay and miscommunication in processing the Applicant's Objection for the 2002 taxation year, but by limiting the relief it granted to March 5, 2013, the Minister is taking the position that this delay and confusion ended on that date. The Applicant respectfully disagrees with that position.</P1>
<P1>iii. As stated above, Mr. Ranieri faxed a copy of the Applicant's 2002 T1 Income Tax Return to the Appeals Officer who wrote the March 5, 2013 letter to the Applicant.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit O.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>iv. Two days later, Ms. Farag wrote back to Mr. Ranieri to confirm how the 1999 to 2002 taxation years were reassessed. This letter does not mention the Applicant's fax sent two days earlier.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit Q.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>v. The Applicant did not receive any correspondence from an Appeals Officer until over one year later when Ms. Aman writes to the Applicant requesting further supporting documents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit S.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>vi. There is no explanation provided as to why neither Ms. Farag nor Ms. Aman failed to correspond with the Applicant or his representative during this period.</P1>
<P1>vii. Ms. Farag and Ms. Aman had ample time to review the fax dated April 10, 2013 and to generate a list of further questions.</P1>
<P1>viii. Given that Ms. Aman incorrectly stated that the Applicant had submitted his return without schedules, it leaves the Applicant wondering how much attention was actually given to the April 10, 2013 fax.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit O.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>ix. The Applicant submits that it is not justifiable for the Minister to have accepted that she delayed the processing of the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2002 taxation year from June 24, 2011 to March 5, 2013 but that there were no further delays until May 5, 2014.</P1>
<P1>x. The Applicant submits that Ms. MacGregor's misunderstanding of the facts lead to her unreasonable conclusion that the delay in processing the Applicant's objection for the 2002 taxation year after March 5, 2013 was due to the inaction of either the Applicant or his representative.</P1>
<P1>xi. Upon a review of the record, the conclusion defensible in respect of the facts is that between March 6, 2013 and May 5, 2014, the CRA took no further action to resolve the Applicant's 2002 objection. Accordingly, the Applicant submits that this is grounds for the cancellation of interest that accrued between March 6, 2013 and May 5, 2014 pursuant to paragraph 26(f) of IC07-1.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>IC07-1, at para 26(f).</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1></P>
<P>j. Delay #2: between June 24, 2011 to December 6, 2013 for the 2003 taxation year:
<P1>i. The Minister found that there were no delays with respect to the 2003 taxation year after June 24, 2011. The Applicant respectfully disagrees.</P1>
<P1>ii. On June 24, 2011, Mr. Ranieri filed a Notice of Objection which included the 2003 taxation year. At the time of the Objection, the Applicant was under the impression that the date of Reassessment was April 8, 2010 and that the Objection was valid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit G.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>iii. Until January 4, 2012, the Applicant had no reason to believe that his Notice of Objection was not filed on a timely basis.</P1>
<P1>iv. On January 4, 2012, the Minister issued a letter stating that both the 2002 and 2003 taxation years could not be accepted pursuant to subsection 169(3) of the <EM>ITA</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit H.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>v. In addition to the Applicant's Notice of Objection for the 2003 taxation year, on March 16, 2012, the Applicant filed T1 income tax returns for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Respondent's Affidavit, tab I, page 23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>vi. As such, between March 16, 2012 and March 5, 2013, the Applicant believed that there were two processes that were being worked with the Minister to resolve the 2003 taxation year.</P1>
<P1>vii. While Mr. Ranieri's submissions with respect to the validity of the notice of objection for the 2003 taxation year continued until March 5, 2013, there is no indication that the Applicant's T1 Income Tax Returns that were filed on March 16, 2012 were being processed.</P1>
<P1>viii. According to Mr. Ranieri, the CRA failed to communicate with him until September, 2014, when he was contacted by phone by Mr. Pagonis.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit R.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>ix. Shortly thereafter, on October 2, 2013, Mr. Pagonis informed Mr. Ranieri that because Objections had been filed, he could not consider them under this process.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit R.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>x. This timeline was confirmed by Ms. MacGregor as part of her report to the ultimate decision-makers, Ms. Lori Beck and Mr. Dean Rush.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Tracy MacGregor, Exhibit C, bottom paragraph, page 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>xi. However, by March 5, 2013, Ms. Farag had already confirmed that the Notice of Objection for the 2003 taxation year was not valid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Robert Jewett, Exhibit N.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P1>
<P1>xii. As such, it is unclear why the processing of the T1 Income Tax Return for the 2003 taxation year would otherwise be delayed when the CRA Appeals Division was not considering that a valid objection had been filed for that year.</P1>
<P1>xiii. The Minister's decision is not defensible in respect of the facts because between June 24, 2011 and December 5, 2013, the Applicant was undertaking all options available to him to resolve his tax debt for the 2003 taxation year.</P1>
<P1>xiv. This resolution process was unnecessarily delayed until March 5, 2013, because of the confusion as to the validity of the 2003 objection that was created by CRA's correspondence of January 4, 2012, and thereafter until December 6, 2013, because CRA was not processing the T1 income tax returns because of a mistaken belief that that year was being dealt with by the CRA Appeals Division. The Applicant submits that this is grounds for relief pursuant to IC07-1 paragraph 26(f), as the process pursued by the Applicant is similar to an objection or an appeal.</P1></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>

<BLOCK1><TI>RESPONDENT'S MEMORANDUM OF FACT AND LAW</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">OVERVIEW</TI>
<P><P1>1. The Minister of National Revenue (the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;), in exercising the discretion conferred upon her under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Income Tax Act</EM>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the &ldquo;<EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;), allowed in part the Applicant's request for waiver of interest in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years, the decision of which was communicated to the Applicant by letter dated July 19, 2017 (the &ldquo;Decision&rdquo;).</P1>
<P1>2. The Decision granted the Applicant interest relief in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011 due to actions of the Canada Revenue Agency (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;). The Applicant seeks judicial review of the Decision.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART I&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P><P1>3. The facts relevant to the review of the Decision are set out in the affidavit of Robert Jewett, sworn September 6, 2017 (the &ldquo;Applicant's Affidavit&rdquo;) and the affidavit of Tracey MacGregor, sworn October 11, 2017 (the &ldquo;Respondent's Affidavit&rdquo;).</P1></P>

<BLOCK4><TI><EM>ITA ss. 152(7) Assessments, Objections and Confirmation</EM></TI>
<P><P1>4. The Applicant did not file income tax returns for the 2002 and 2003 tax years as and when required by the <EM>Act</EM>.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 02 and Exhibit &ldquo;I&rdquo;: Reproduction of Letter from CRA to Robert Jewett dated September 04, 2007.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>5. The Minister assessed the Applicant's tax liability under the <EM>Act</EM> for the 2002 and 2003 tax years, the concurrent notices of which were dated February 1, 2008 (collectively the &ldquo;Assessments&rdquo;). The Assessments were made under subsection 152(7) of the <EM>Act</EM>.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 02 and Exhibits &ldquo;D&rdquo;, &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>6. The Applicant objected to the Assessments, the notices of which were received by the Minister on May 2, 2008.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03 and Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>7. The Minister confirmed the Assessments, the notice of which was dated June 25, 2009.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;D&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03 and Exhibit &ldquo;H&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>8. The Applicant did not appeal the Assessments to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Tax Court Judgment and Consequential Assessment of 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>9. On November 29, 2009, the Tax Court of Canada rendered judgment in respect of an appeal from the Minister's assessments of the Applicant's tax liability under the <EM>Act</EM> for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 tax years (the &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>10. The Judgment, among other things, referred the Applicant's 2001 tax year back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that &ldquo;...the $47,576 credit card balance from 2001, should be removed from personal expenditures in 2001 and put in 2002.&rdquo;
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;E&rdquo; at para. 30 (p. 39 of 755).</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>11. The Minister reassessed the Applicant's tax liability under the <EM>Act</EM> for the 2002 tax year, the notice of which was dated April 8, 2010, to implement the Judgment (the &ldquo;Consequential Assessment&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibits</BOLD> &ldquo;F&rdquo; <BOLD>and &ldquo;Q&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Applicant's Objection re: 2002 Tax Year</EM></TI>
<P><P1>12. The Applicant objected to the Consequential Assessment i.e. the reassessment of the 2002 tax year, the notice of which was received by the Minister on June 24, 2011. The notice also purported to object to the Minister's assessment of the Applicant's 2003 tax year.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;G&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>13. In the period from June 24, 2011 to March 5, 2013, communication from the CRA to the Applicant erroneously stated that the Minister cannot accept an objection to the Consequential Assessment when in fact such an objection may be valid.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibits &ldquo;H&rdquo;, &ldquo;J&rdquo; and &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>14. On or about March 5, 2013, the CRA communicated with the Applicant and provide him with the correct information with respect to his objection for the 2002 tax year, including the fact that the objection is valid and active.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;N&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>15. The Minister allowed the Applicant's objection for the 2002 tax year in part, the decision of which was communicated to the Applicant by letter dated July 24, 2014.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;W&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo;, Page 03.</BOLD></P2></P1></P>
<BLOCK5><TI><EM>First Level Review</EM></TI>
<P><P1>16. In May 2016, the Applicant applied to the Minister for waiver of interest for the 2002 and 2003 tax years (the &ldquo;First Level Request&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;Y&rdquo;</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at para. 4.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>17. The Minister made the decision to allow the Applicant's request in part, and granted the applicant interest relief in respect of the 2002 tax year from June 24, 2011 up to March 5, 2013, the decision of which was communicated to the Applicant by letter dated December 5, 2016 (the &ldquo;First Level Decision&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at para. 6 and Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK5></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Second Level Request and Decision</EM></TI>
<P><P1>18. In May 2017, the Applicant applied to the Minister for reconsideration of the First Level Decision (the &ldquo;Second Level Request&rdquo;).
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit &ldquo;AA&rdquo;</BOLD></P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at para. 7.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>19. In reviewing the Second Level Request, the Minister determined that the Second Level Request should be allowed in part, and that interest relief be granted for the 2002 and 2003 tax years from May 2, 2008 to June 24, 2011 due to CRA delay.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at para. 8 to 10 and Exhibits &ldquo;C&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rdquo;, inclusive.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART II&mdash;POINTS IN ISSUE</TI>
<P><P1>20. The sole issue in this application is whether the Decision is reasonable.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV">PART III&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>A</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Standard of Review</EM></TI>
<P><P1>21. Subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Act</EM> confers upon the Minister the discretion to waive interest imposed under the <EM>Act</EM>. The exercise of the Minister's discretion under this subsection is an administrative decision subject to review by the Court.</P1>
<P1>22. In reviewing an administrative decision, the reviewing court must determine the proper standard of review. There are only two standards of review applicable to judicial reviews of administrative decisions: correctness and reasonableness.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</SOC><CITE>2008 SCC 9</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[<EM>Dunsmuir</EM>], at para. 34</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>23. In <EM>Telfer</EM>, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the standard of review applicable to decisions made under subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Act</EM> is (un)reasonableness.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Telfer v. Canada (Revenue Agency)</SOC><CITE>2009 FCA 23</CITE><PARANUM>24</PARANUM></CASEREF></P2></P1>
<P1>24. In <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, the Supreme Court elaborated on the reasonableness standard in the context of judicial review:
<QUOTE><P>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead they may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. <UNDER>A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</UNDER>
<P1>(my emphasis)</P1></P></QUOTE>
<P2><BOLD><EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, at para. 47</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>25. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion. If the reasons given allow the reviewing court to understand why a decision was made and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <EM>Dunsmuir</EM> criteria are met.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>N.L.N.U. v. Newfoundland &amp; Labrador (Treasury Board)</SOC><CITE>2011 SCC 62</CITE><PARANUM>15 and 16</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>B</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Taxpayer Relief Policy</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Income Tax Information Circular IC07-1</EM></TI>
<P><P1>26. The CRA guideline sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors that will be considered by the Minister in exercising her discretion to waive interest, including:
<P2>a. extraordinary circumstances;</P2>
<P2>b. actions of the CRA; and</P2>
<P2>c. inability to pay or financial hardship.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Income Tax Information Circular IC07-1 (&ldquo;IC07-1&rdquo;) at para. 23</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>27. Actions of the CRA that may have prevented a taxpayer from making a payment when due, filing a return on time, or otherwise complying with an obligation under the <EM>Act</EM> include, but are not limited to, the following:
<P2>a. processing delays that result in the taxpayer not being informed, within a reasonable time, that an amount was owing;</P2>
<P2>b. errors in material available to the public, which led taxpayers to file returns or make payments based on incorrect information;</P2>
<P2>c. incorrect information provided to a taxpayer;</P2>
<P2>d. error in processing;</P2>
<P2>e. delays in providing information, such as when a taxpayer could not make the appropriate instalment or arrears payments because the necessary information was not available; or</P2>
<P2>f. undue delays in resolving an objection or an appeal, or in completing an audit.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>IC07-1, at para. 26</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>28. When determining whether to exercise her discretion to waive interest, the following factors will be considered by the Minister:
<P2>a. whether the taxpayer has a history of compliance with tax obligations;</P2>
<P2>b. whether the taxpayer has knowingly allowed a balance to exist on which arrears interest has accrued;</P2>
<P2>c. whether the taxpayer has exercised a reasonable amount of care and has not been negligent or careless in conducting their affairs under the self-assessment system; and</P2>
<P2>d. whether the taxpayer has acted quickly to remedy any delay or omission.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>IC07-1, at para. 33</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>29. While taxpayers are generally considered responsible for errors made or delays caused by third parties acting for the taxpayer for income tax matters, there may be exceptional situations where it may be appropriate to provide relief to taxpayers because of third- party errors or delays.
<P2><BOLD>IC07-1, at para. 35</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>C</EM>.</N><TI><EM>Decision was Reasonable</EM></TI>
<P><P1>30. The subject of this judicial review is the Decision and whether it was reasonable. As explained by the Supreme Court in <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>, a review for reasonableness is an inquiry into both the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. The review of the Decision is therefore a determination of the following:
<P2>a. whether the decision-making process of the Minister in coming to the Decision was justified, transparent and intelligible; and</P2>
<P2>b. whether the Decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</P2></P1></P>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>The Decision / Interest Relief re: 2002 and 2003 Tax Years</EM></TI>
<P><P1>31. The Decision granted the Applicant interest relief in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011 due to CRA delays.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;J&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>32. The relief granted by the Decision is in addition to the interest relief in respect of the 2002 tax year from June 24, 2011 up to March 5, 2013 already granted by the Minister in the First Level Decision.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at para. 6 and Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>33. The cumulative interest relief granted by the Minister to the Applicant in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years is therefore as follows:
<P2>a. for the 2002 tax year&mdash;from May 2, 2008 up to March 5, 2013; and</P2>
<P2>b. for the 2003 tax year&mdash;from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011.</P2></P1>
<P1>34. The Minister reviewed the CRA records and the Applicant's submissions, and determined that the Applicant did not warrant any further interest relief in respect of the 2002 and 2003 tax years.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Page 05</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Applicant's History of Compliance / Conduct of Affairs under Self-Assessment System</EM></TI>
<P><P1>35. The Applicant did not file his income tax returns for the 2002 and 2003 tax years as and when required by the <EM>Act</EM>.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Page 02</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>36. The Minister issued a warning letter to the Applicant with respect to his failure to file income tax returns for the 2002 and 2003 tax years, and subsequent to the Assessments, issued multiple warning letters to the Applicant with respect to his significant income tax arrears for multiple tax years including the 2002 and 2003 tax years.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Page 02-03 and Exhibits &ldquo;D&rdquo;, &ldquo;E&rdquo;, &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>Errors Made by Applicant's Lawyer Compounded by CRA Delays</EM></TI>
<P><P1>37. The Applicant did not appeal the Assessments to the Tax Court of Canada, which was attributed to errors made by his lawyers.
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Pages 03-04</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>38. The CRA communication with the Applicant between June 25, 2009 and June 24, 2011 compounded the problem of the errors made by the Applicant's lawyer by not providing the following information clearly to the Applicant:
<P2>a. the Consequential Assessment was issued to implement the Judgment and was with respect to the 2002 tax year only, which the Applicant may object to and the Minister will process the objection to the Consequential Assessment; and</P2>
<P2>b. the Minister did not reassess the Applicant's 2003 tax year, and since the Minister confirmed the Assessments on June 25, 2009, the Applicant needed to appeal to the Tax Court to dispute the assessment with respect to the 2003 tax year.</P2>
<P2><BOLD>Respondent's Affidavit at Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; Pages 03-05</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>39. The Minister considered the incorrect information provided to the Applicant with respect to the objections with respect to the 2002 and 2003 tax years and concluded that these were actions of the CRA that caused delay. On that basis, the Minister determined that interest relief should be granted for the 2002 and 2003 tax years from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011, which covers the period from when the Applicant first objected to the Assessments to when the Applicant first objected to the Consequential Assessment.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>No CRA Delay re: 2002 Tax Year from March 6, 2013 to May 5, 2014</EM></TI>
<P><P1>40. The period from March 6, 2013 to May 5, 2014 was when the Minister processed the Applicant's objection to the Consequential Assessment i.e. the 2002 tax year. The Applicant and the CRA were engaged in ongoing correspondence with respect to the objection during this period in the usual course of resolving an objection.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit at Exhibits &ldquo;O&rdquo;, &ldquo;P&rdquo;, &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, &ldquo;R&rdquo;, &ldquo;S&rdquo; and &ldquo;T&rdquo;.</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>41. The Respondent submits that it was not unreasonable for CRA to take 14 months to resolve the Applicant's objection with respect to the Consequential Assessment.
<P2><CASEREF><SOC>Metro-Can Construction Limited v. R.</SOC><CITE>2002 FCT 1171</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P2></P1>
<P1>42. Furthermore, the Applicant had a right to appeal the Consequential Assessment to the Tax Court at any time during the period from March 6, 2013 to May 5, 2014.</P1></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><TI><EM>No CRA Delay re: 2003 Tax Year from June 24, 2011 to December 6, 2013</EM></TI>
<P><P1>43. The Applicant did not have a valid objection with the Minister with respect to the 2003 tax year in the period from June 24, 2011 to December 6, 2013 and therefore there were no CRA delays.</P1>
<P1>44. A review of the correspondence between the Applicant and CRA during this period shows that while the Applicant's lawyer consistently and incorrectly referenced the 2003 tax year as a year under objection, the CRA has never stated that the Applicant has a valid objection with respect to the 2003 tax year.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit at Exhibits &ldquo;G&rdquo;, &ldquo;H&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;K&rdquo;, &ldquo;L&rdquo;</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>45. In particular, the CRA letter to the Applicant dated December 19, 2012 clearly referenced the Minister's confirmation with respect to the 2003 tax year, and by February 1, 2013, the Applicant's lawyer stopped referencing the 2003 tax year in his letters to CRA.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit at Exhibits &ldquo;J&rdquo; and &ldquo;M&rdquo;</BOLD></P2></P1>
<P1>46. Finally, the CRA letter to the Applicant dated March 5, 2013 stated clearly that the Applicant did not have an objection with the Minister with respect to the 2003 tax year.
<P2><BOLD>Applicant's Affidavit at Exhibit</BOLD> &ldquo;N&rdquo;</P2></P1>
<P1>47. The Respondent submits that if there were any delays with respect to the 2003 tax year in the period June 24, 2011 to December 6, 2013, the delays were due to errors made by the Applicant's lawyer, and that such errors were not compounded by any actions of the CRA.</P1>
<P1>48. Subsection 220(3.1) of the <EM>Act</EM> grants broad discretion to the Minister to allow relief or partial relief. In the present case, the Minister's discretion was properly exercised. The Minister took into account the relevant factors in her consideration of the Applicant's circumstances in coming to the Decision. The Decision to waive interest for the 2002 and 2003 tax years from May 2, 2008 up to June 24, 2011 was reasonable.</P1>
<P1>49. The Decision granted the Applicant interest relief and the Respondent submits that the outcome is within the range of acceptable and rational solutions contemplated by <EM>Dunsmuir</EM>. While the Applicant may argue that the Minister could have more generous, such is not the test for whether or not the Decision was reasonable.

<P><P1>50. The Respondent concedes that paragraph 12 of the Respondent's Affidavit contained an error. The First Level Decision granted interest relief for the Applicant's 2002 tax year only, and therefore the reference to relief for &ldquo;...2002 <BOLD><UNDER>and 2003</UNDER></BOLD> taxation years...&rdquo; in paragraph 12 of the Respondent's Affidavit is incorrect.</P1>
<P1>51. However, the Respondent submits that the error in paragraph 12 of the Respondent's Affidavit has no bearing on the Decision under review for the following reasons:
<P2>a. the error is patently obvious as it is contradicted by the exhibits annexed to the Respondent's Affidavit, in particular, <BOLD>Exhibits &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo;</BOLD>; and</P2>
<P2>b. the Respondent's Affidavit was prepared in the course of this proceeding and was not a document prepared in the course of or considered by the Minister in the process of making the Decision.</P2></P1></P></BLOCK3>

<P><P1>52. The Minister's decision-making process was justifiable, transparent and intelligible. The Minister exercised her statutory discretion in good faith and observed the principles of natural justice, and made a reasonable decision based on the relevant facts and considerations before her. The Applicant was permitted the opportunity to make representations and those representations were fully reviewed and considered by the Minister. The reasons for Decision were then clearly communicated to the Applicant. The Decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.</P1>
<P1>53. The Decision was reasonable, and deference should be accorded to the same.</P1></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
