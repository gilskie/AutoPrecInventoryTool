<P1>(b) the resulting Judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs, inclusive of pre-judgment interest and after the apportionment of liability, was $2,625,640.00;</P1>
<P1>(c) Justice McLean erred in law in granting an assignment of future accident benefits payable to the Plaintiff, Barbara Carroll, where there was no allocation by the jury of the future care costs and instead only a global assessment;</P1>
<P1>(d) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to appreciate and/or apply the proper test for the assignment of collateral benefits;</P1>
<P1>(e) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to provide any comparison or matching of the jury verdict to the accident benefits for which the assignment was sought;</P1>
<P1>(f) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in finding that the Defendants' actuary had done a &ldquo;matching&rdquo; analysis when her role was restricted to a mathematical exercise of calculating the value of the offers to settle and future accident benefits;</P1>
<P1>(g) Justice McLean erred in law in granting an assignment of accident benefits without requiring the Defendants to fully compensate the Plaintiffs;</P1>
<P1>(h) Justice McLean erred in law in prohibiting the Plaintiffs from claiming under the bankruptcy of the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen, for any shortfall in satisfaction of the resulting Judgment;</P1>
<P1>(i) Justice McLean exceeded his jurisdiction by extinguishing the Plaintiffs' rights under the bankruptcy of the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen;</P1>
<P1>(j) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to consider, or even mention, an offer to settle of the Plaintiffs as against the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen, which the Defendants ought to have accepted as it was significantly lower (approximately $1,625,000 lower) than the ultimate jury award and it would have permitted those Defendants to have settled the action within their insurance limits;</P1>
<P1>(k) Justice McLean erred in law in failing to consider the costs implications of the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen, remaining in the action when the Plaintiffs offered to settle within insurance limits in circumstances where there was no question that the $1,000,000 insurance limits of the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen, would be exhausted;</P1>
<P1>(l) Justice McLean erred in fact and in law in failing to appropriately consider that the Plaintiffs were successful in obtaining a jury verdict which exceeded both the Plaintiffs' offer to settle against the Defendants, Robert and Caroline McEwen and also the Plaintiffs' joint offer to settle against both Defendants;</P1>
<P1>(m) Justice McLean failed to consider and/or apply Rule 49.13 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM> with respect to offers to settle made by the Plaintiffs;</P1>
<P1>(n) Justice McLean erred in law in determining that the insurance limits of the Defendants were relevant to the issue of costs particularly when the Defendants refused to pay their insurance limits to settle the action despite receiving offers to settle within insurance limits;</P1>
<P1>(o) Justice McLean erred in law in failing to put any weight on the numerous offers to settle of the Plaintiffs which provided clear and convincing evidence that the sole reason this action proceeded to trial was due to the Defendants' conduct in refusing to accept reasonable settlement offers which were exceeded by the Jury Verdict;</P1>
<P1>(p) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in suggesting that the Jury Verdict exceeding the Plaintiffs' offers (as well as the offers of the Defendants) was insufficient as the margin of success was not &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; over the offers to settle;</P1>
<P1>(q) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in considering incorrect values for accident benefits prior to trial which even the Defendant's own expert admitted were in error;</P1>
<P1>(r) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to consider or even summarize the arguments raised by the Plaintiffs with respect to costs and erred in stating that the Plaintiffs argued that &ldquo;these offers were exceeded by the jury verdict by approximately $2,600,000.00&rdquo; which was never the position of the Plaintiff nor is it logistically possible unless the Plaintiffs had offered to settle for &lt;nil&gt;;</P1>
<P1>(s) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to appropriately consider and value the offers to settle exchanged between the parties;</P1>
<P1>(t) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to consider that the Defendant's offer to settle (which resulted in the failed settlement) expressly stated that the offer was for &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; and did not state that it included either the bad faith claims which the Defendants knew was going to be the subject of a subsequent legal action nor did it state that it included past accident benefits;</P1>
<P1>(u) Justice McLean erred in fact and in law in inconsistently interpreting the Defendants' offers to settle as including the bad faith action and past accident benefits for the purposes of criticizing the conduct of Plaintiffs' counsel with respect to the failed settlement but <UNDER>not</UNDER> including any valuation of those claims for the purposes of assessing costs;</P1>
<P1>(v) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in failing to consider that the Defendants' offers included the additional claims (bad faith and past accident benefits) despite finding it was apparently &ldquo;without doubt&rdquo; that these offers included the other claims and the Defendants took the position that they would <UNDER>not</UNDER> settle without release of those other claims;</P1>
<P1>(w) Justice McLean erred in law in failing to consider that the Defendants ought to have proceeded with the failed settlement as the Plaintiffs obtained a more favourable jury verdict even without consideration of the value of past accident benefits or the bad faith claims which remain outstanding;</P1>
<P1>(x) Justice McLean erred in fact and law by characterizing the offer to settle of the Defendants of $1.75M offer as a &ldquo;Rule 49 offer&rdquo; when it was admitted by the Defendants that acceptance of this offer included a release of claims outside the scope of the within action (i.e. bad faith claims and past accident benefits);</P1>
<P1>(y) Justice McLean erred in fact and law in reducing the Plaintiffs' entitlement to costs due to the late service of expert reports while completely ignoring the fact that both parties served expert reports outside of the case management timetable, including one expert report of the Defendants which was served in the middle of trial and after the Plaintiffs' expert had already testified; and</P1>
<P1>(z) such further and other ground as Counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE BASIS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S JURISDICTION IS:</BOLD>
<P1>(a) sections 6(1)(b) and s.133 of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(b) Rule 61.03.01(17) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>;</P1>
<P1>(c) the Order of Justice McLean is a final Order; and</P1>
<P1>(d) such farther and other basis as Counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">NOTICE OF CROSS-APPEAL OF THE DEFENDANTS ROBERT MCEWEN AND CAROLINE MCEWEN</TI>
<P><BOLD>THE RESPONDENTS, ROBERT MCEWEN AND CAROLINE MCEWEN CROSS-APPEAL</BOLD> in this appeal and asks that the judgment/Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice McLean dated May 19, 2016 be varied as follows:
<P1>1. An Order setting aside the costs Order of the Trial Judge dated May 19, 2016;</P1>
<P1>2. An Order that the Defendants be awarded their costs of the action;</P1>
<P1>3. In the alternative, an Order that there be no order as to costs with respect to the trial of this matter; and</P1>
<P1>4. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.</P1></P>
<P><BOLD>THE GROUNDS FOR THIS CROSS-APPEAL</BOLD> are as follows:
<P1>1. The Trial Judge properly found that the Defendants were entitled to an assignment of future accident benefits. However, the Trial Judge erred in law and failed to properly consider the value of the assignment in an assessment of the value of the offers to settle made by the Defendants;</P1>
<P1>2. The Trial Judge appreciated that the value of the Defendants' offers to settle, including an all-inclusive settlement offer of $2,150,000.00, with no assignment of future accident benefits, dated September 11, 2015 rendered the trial of slight benefit to the Plaintiffs. The Trial Judge erred in law in the exercise of his discre tion when he awarded $375,000.00 in costs to the Plaintiffs;</P1>
<P1>3. The Trial Judge failed to apply the appropriate sanction for what had been discussed as &ldquo;sharp practice&rdquo; with respect to the Appellants' acceptance of the $2,150,000.00 offer dated September 11, 2015 and the immediate issuance of a new action against the Respondent Aviva Canada Inc. claiming $2,000,000.00 in damages, a tactic that the Trial Judge accurately described as &ldquo;a trick&rdquo;; and</P1>
<P1>4. The Trial Judge correctly held that the Appellants gave &ldquo;lip service&rdquo; to the Order of the Case Management Master dated May 26, 2014. The Case Management Order required service of all expert reports 90 days in advance of the pre-trial on June 17, 2015. Instead, the Plaintiffs served a report, dated August 18, 2015, containing a new plan for the Plaintiff Barbara Carroll's future care, even though they had advised the Defendants prior to the pre-trial that Barbara Carroll's future care needs had not changed. The Trial Judge erred in law in the exercise of his discretion when he failed to apply the appropriate sanction for this and other aspects of the conduct of counsel for the Plaintiffs in his award of $375,000.00 in costs to the Plaintiffs.</P1></P>

<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;NATURE OF THE APPEAL</TI>
<P>1. The Plaintiff Barbara Carroll appeals the Judgment of the Honourable Justice McLean, dated October 30, 2015, following an eight (8) week trial with a jury at Ottawa, Ontario.</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiffs received Judgment in the amount of $2,610,774.32, together with $375,000 in costs. It further provided for an assignment of future statutory accident benefits <UNDER>upon payment of the Judgment</UNDER>. To-date, the Defendants have not paid the Judgment and have only paid their insurance limits of $2,000,000 (plus accrued interest on that amount). No amount has been paid on costs.</P></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;OVERVIEW STATEMENT</TI>
<P>3. On March 28, 2009, Barbara Carroll, then a pedestrian, sustained a catastrophic brain injury when she was struck by a motor vehicle owned by the Defendant Caroline McEwen and operated by the Defendant Robert McEwen (&ldquo;the McEwens&rdquo;).</P>
<P>4. Barbara Carroll commenced this action to recover damages for her personal injuries sustained in the accident. She named as defendants in the action, in addition to the McEwens, the Pilot Insurance Company (&ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;) and Aviva Canada Limited (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;) as her OPCF 44 (Family Protection Endorsement) insurers. The Family Protection Endorsement contained insurance limits of $2,000,000. The McEwens held liability coverage with Aviva with a limit of $1,000,000.</P>
<P>5. The jury, at the conclusion of a lengthy hard fought trial assessed the Plaintiffs damages at $4,083,000 and split liability 62/38 in the Plaintiffs' favour. The resulting Judgment amount of $2,610,774.32 was broken down as follows:
<P1>(a) Barbara Lynn Carroll
<P2>General damages of $186,000 plus prejudgment interest of $58,512.50</P2></P1>
<P1>(b) Shannon Luknowsky
<P2>General damages of $43,400 plus prejudgment interest of $13,652.92</P2></P1>
<P1>(c) Jeffrey Carroll
<P2>General damages of $43,400.00 plus prejudgment interest of $13,652.92</P2></P1>
<P1>(d) The Estate of Lome Carroll
<P2>General damages of $15,332.60 plus prejudgment interest of $4,823.38</P2></P1>
<P1>(e) Barbara Lynn Carroll
<P2>For the cost of future care $2,232,000</P2></P1></P>
<P>6. Following receipt of the jury verdict, McLean J entertained further evidence and heard submissions on, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the following issues:
<P1>(a) assignment of benefits under the <EM>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</EM> (the &ldquo;SABS&rdquo;);</P1>
<P1>(b) the effect of the McEwen bankruptcy on the McEwen's personal liability; and</P1>
<P1>(c) costs.</P1></P>
<P>6. McLean J determined as follows:
<P1>(a) upon payment of the full amount of the Judgment, Barbara Carroll is ordered to assign future accident benefits (attendant care and medical and rehabilitation benefits) to which the Plaintiff is entitled to receive after the Judgment is paid;</P1>
<P1>(b) Judgment was rendered for the full amount ($2,610,774.32) but the personal liability of the McEwens was limited to the insurance limits of $1,000,000;</P1>
<P1>(c) no determination was made regarding any claims which could be made in the bankruptcy;</P1>
<P1>(d) Pilot/Aviva were found liable for an additional $1,000,000 under the OPCF 44; and</P1>
<P1>(e) the Plaintiffs' request for costs (including disbursements) was reduced by more than 50% from a bill of costs of $795,616.09, on a partial indemnity basis, down to $375,000 to punish the Plaintiffs for alleged wrongdoings.</P1></P>
<P>7. The within appeal is limited to two issues:
<P1>(i) the assignment of future accident benefits; and</P1>
<P1>(ii) costs.</P1></P>
<P>8. On the issue of the assignment of accident benefits, the Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the learned trial judge erred in law in granting the assignment in circumstances where the Judgment had not been paid in full and the jury's lump sum assessment did not allow the court to match the award of future care costs to the particular accident benefits that might be received in the future</P>
<P>9. With respect to deductibility and assignment of collateral benefits, the issue before this five&mdash;member panel is to determine the law generally applicable to all litigants in motor vehicle litigation. An interpretation of the legislation that enables parties to litigate only issues actually in dispute (and then match the damages to collateral sources) is preferable to an interpretation that would require injured plaintiffs to sue for <UNDER>all</UNDER> past and future damages even if those damages are fully compensated by collateral sources. Litigants should be encouraged to act reasonably and not waste judicial time and resources to prove <UNDER>each and every</UNDER> claim for the sole purpose of avoiding unfair deductions and/or assignments.</P>
<P>10. On the matter of costs, the Plaintiffs respectfully submit that McLean J fell into serious error in sanctioning Plaintiffs' counsel for conduct that His Honour characterized as a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; by reducing the Plaintiffs' reasonable partial indemnity costs request by over 50% (a penalty of more than $400,000). His Honour erred in penalizing the Plaintiffs for accepting an offer to se ttle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; which the Defendants alleged, <UNDER>only after acceptance</UNDER>, had implied terms including claims outside of &ldquo;this proceeding.&rdquo; Any misunderstanding resulting from the Defendants' conduct in failing to identify implied terms in an offer to settle should be borne solely upon them. This was particularly alarming as there was another offer, using the same wording to settle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; that was still open for acceptance which the Defendants maintained had Rule 49 costs consequences. It was only during a mid-trial motion proceeding before Hackland J that it was discovered that both offers had implied terms which required release of claims which fell outside of the proceeding. The deceptive practice of having implied terms in offers to settle th at purport to have costs consequences is not reasonable nor appropriate. There may have been a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; being played, but the &ldquo;trick&rdquo; was not perpetrated by the Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>11. Furthermore, McLean J fell into palpable and overriding error in:
<P1>(a) failing to give any weight to Offers to Settle made by the Plaintiffs which were in amounts considerably less than the Judgment amount;</P1>
<P1>(b) penalizing the Plaintiffs for the Defendants seeking leave at the outset of trial for an examination for discovery of the Plaintiff Barbara Carroll; and</P1>
<P1>(c) penalizing the Plaintiffs for non-compliance with the case management time line for service of expert reports in circumstances where both parties failed to meet the time line.</P1></P></BLOCK1>

<P1>Defendants' Proposed Jury Questions and Authorities Brief, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 25, p. 147&mdash;150.</P1></P>
<P>15. At trial, the Plaintiffs' claims for future cost of care were detailed by individual items claimed, their annual cost and the present value factor. The jury was also provided with the tools to calculate the present value of items for differing periods of time depending upon the length of time the jury determined the item(s) would be payable.
<P1>Present Value Chart of Gary Principe; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 62, pp.572&ndash;575.</P1></P>
<P>16. The Defendants did not ask the jury to divide the damages into particular items of future care nor did they ask the jury to determine the future care costs by benefit categories contained in the <EM>SABS</EM>. This is despite the fact that the evidence at trial divided the needs in a manner consistent with proper matching of the jury award to benefits available. Under the <EM>SABS</EM>, medical and rehabilitation benefits are covered by a separate limit of insurance than attendant care benefits.

<P1>Future Care Chart, Trial Exhibit #10, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 63.</P1></P>
<P>17. Arguments were made by the Plaintiffs after trial that the issue of an assignment of benefits was moot or premature as the Defendants had not paid the Judgment as required by the legislation. The trial judge accepted that the Judgment may not be paid but nonetheless concluded that the argument advanced by the Plaintiffs was &ldquo;not persuasive&rdquo; as &ldquo;the Plaintiffs were well aware of this situation before trial commenced and were well aware of the risks of litigation.&rdquo; McLean J's reasoning was unresponsive to the Plaintiffs' argument.
<P1>Judgment of Justice McLean, October 30, 2015; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 3, p.5, para 8 and 30.</P1></P>
<P>18. The trial judge ordered that once the Defendants pay the full amount of the Judgment (plus interest and costs), Barbara Carroll will then be required to assign to Aviva/Pilot all payments that Barbara Carroll is entitled to receive, after the Judgment has been paid, for SABS in respect of medical and rehabilitation benefits and attendant care benefits. No determination was made by the trial judge matching the jury award to particular benefits-payable to Barbara Carroll under the SABS.

<P1>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 4, pp.17&ndash;34.</P1></P>
<P>19. The trial judge determined that Ms. Larouche, the Defendant's actuary, &ldquo;provided substantial evidence with regard to the nature of the future care plan and indirectly its matching with the jury's award.&rdquo; This is not correct. After trial, Ms. Larouche provided evidence on the present value of accident benefits as of September 8, 2015 as well as a calculation comparing the total value of the jury award to settlement offers exchanged prior to trial. Neither her affidavit material, nor her report, attempts any sort of matching between the jury award and the SABS. It was an analysis made purely for cost purposes to compare the ultimate Judgment to a series of offers to settle.

<BLOCK3><N>(a)</N><TI>Attempted settlement of &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo;</TI>
<P>20. Prior to the calling of evidence at trial, the Plaintiffs accepted an offer of the Defendants in the amount of $2,150,000 inclusive of costs. The offer was drafted by the Defendants with the style of cause in the within court file and read as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The Defendants offer to settle this <UNDER>proceeding</UNDER> on the following terms:</P>
<P>Payment by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs the sum of $2,150,000 inclusive of all damages, prejudgment interest and costs. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Offer to Settle of the Defendants, September 11, 2015, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 36, pp. 177&ndash;179.</P1></P>
<P>21. The wording for Rule 49 Offers to Settle is set out in Form 49A as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The (identifying party) offers to settle <UNDER>this proceeding</UNDER> (or the following claims in this proceeding) on the following terms:... [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1>Form 49 A, Table of Forms, Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 40, p. 196.</P1></P>
<P>22. Correspondence from counsel of Pilot/Aviva stated that the joint offer to settle was made &ldquo;pursuant to the Rules&rdquo; and warned of &ldquo;costs consequences&rdquo; of the offer if not accepted.
<P1>Letter of Robert Sutherland, dated September 11, 2015, Exhibit &ldquo;U&rdquo; to the Affidavit of Elizabeth Quigley, September 14, 2015 Appeal Book and Co mpendium, Tab 41, p.197.</P1></P>
<P>23. After the Plaintiffs accepted the Defendants' offer, the Defendants took the position that the offer was not limited to this proceeding and sought to rescind the settlement on the basis that the settlement required a full and final release of:
<P1>(a) any and all bad faith claims between the Plaintiffs and Pilot/Aviva; and</P1>
<P1>(b) any past claims for SABS and only permitted &ldquo;<UNDER>future</UNDER> claims that Barbara Lynn Carroll may have with respect to a claim for Accident Benefits to her under Pilot Policy No. XXXXXXXXXX <UNDER>based on facts that do not exist as of the date hereof</UNDER>.&rdquo;[emphasis added]</P1>

<P1>Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 42, pp. 198&ndash;201.</P1></P>
<P>24. The expansive release was demanded by the Defendants after the Plaintiffs brought bad faith litigation against Pilot/Aviva as OPCF44 and accident benefits insurer. The bad faith litigation was no surprise to anyone as the bad faith litigation was the subject-matter of letters exchanged by the parties <UNDER>prior</UNDER> to the Defendants' offer to settle. Indeed, in the correspondence string <UNDER>prior</UNDER> to any settlement being reached, the parties had debated whether or not the lawyers acting in the within proceeding would be able to represent the parties in the subsequent bad faith claim.

<P>25. No bad faith claims or accident benefit claims are at issue in the within proceeding. Pilot/Aviva, in its capacity as accident benefits insurer, was not a party to this action. The Defendants' expert and Plaintiffs' expert agreed that the past accident benefits release alone had a value of $50,584.

<P>26. At the motion before Hackland J to enforce the settlement, issues arose with respect to the interpretation of: (a) the accepted offer; and (b) another open offer to settle of the Defendants in the amount of $ 1,757,500 plus costs (characterized by the Defendants as a &ldquo;Rule 49 offer&rdquo;). Both offers were to settle &ldquo;this proceeding.&rdquo; Plaintiffs' counsel raised the following concerns:
<QUOTE><P>[T]here is danger in allowing a defendant, who is represented by three competent counsel, making offers under Rule 49 that are silent about things. And then, when the plaintiff accepts, the claws come out. But if the plaintiff doesn't accept&mdash;it's an ingenious offer. It's an ingenious offer. They never accepted, Your Honour. Read the statement. It's &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; only. It's a dangerous game.</P></QUOTE>

<P>27. At the motion, the Defendants took the position that all offers, including the purported &ldquo;Rule 49 offer&rdquo; required the same release (including the bad faith claims and past accident benefits).
<P1>Transcript before Justice Hackland p..54 line 17-p.55 line 23; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 15, pp. 95&ndash;97.</P1></P>
<P>28. After trial, the Defendants took the position, for costs purposes, that the $1,757,500 to settle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; (which impliedly included the additional claims) was a Rule 49 offer. This was the exact mischief that the motion before Justice Hackland sought to eliminate.

<P1>Rule 49.02(1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</P1></P>
<P>29. The Defendants misled the trial judge by referring to comments made by Hackland J during a dialogue with counsel before he fully understood the facts. The transcripts show that Hackland J was still trying to grasp what actually occurred and admitted as follows:
<QUOTE><P>... I get it now. Sorry, I'm a bit slow. Maybe it's because I'm dealing with drug trafficking at the same time. Okay.</P>
<P>So you're saying you get a Rule 49 offer. The Rule 49 offer can only apply to the personal injury claim. So you knew from that, or you thought from that, that it must be understood that there's no release&mdash;that there's no involvement above the other action you've been talking about bringing, because it's a Rule 49 offer?</P></QUOTE>

<P1>Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 16, pp. 98&ndash;100.</P1></P>
<P>30. Hackland J. further stated during the hearing of the motion:
<QUOTE><P>I think a judge looking at it would probably have to say, assuming that they are looking for release to the bad-faith claim, that it probably isn't a Rule 49 offer. I got your point on that.</P></QUOTE>

<P>31. The motion to enforce the settlement was withdrawn and costs awarded in the cause. No reasons were delivered by the motions judge.

<P>32. In his reasons delivered after trial, McLean J determined that it is &ldquo;without question&rdquo; that the offers were made on the basis of settlement of &ldquo;all matters.&rdquo; He further stated that the Plaintiffs had tried to enforce what was essentially a &ldquo;non-enforceable offer.&rdquo; McLean J concluded that, &ldquo;[t]his is not something that this Court can countenance without sanction.&rdquo;
<P1>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean at paras 13, 34, 36 and 48-49; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 4, pp. 22 and 28 and 32.</P1></P>
<P>33. In arriving at his conclusion on costs at trial, McLean J refers to and relies upon &ldquo;Reasons&rdquo; of Hackland, J in the motion. There were no &ldquo;Reasons&rdquo; and there was no decision. Once the Defendants admitted that their alleged &ldquo;Rule 49&rdquo; offer contained the implied terms, the motion was withdrawn. Hackland J explained his understanding during an appointment to settle the terms of his Order that costs of the motion were &ldquo;in the cause&rdquo;:
<QUOTE><P>...it seemed to be that there are a number of different layers of issues that were unfolded in front of me. When it started out the previous day, actually, in a case conference, when we were talking about this, and then an argument, I thought the basic issue was with respect to the, the second offer, and the acceptance, the communication that Ms. Quigley entered whether or not that was a, an acceptance of an offer that needed, that should be enforced, and, of course, the issue was this sort of, that was this good faith issue that, that has been out there. Was that caught in the settlement or was it not? And then I hear&mdash;that's what I had completely focused on. You know, then, then I hear about whether pa rties intended one or more offers to be Rule 49 offers. I think whether it's a Rule 49 offer not as a characterization of the offer the need to stand to make an offer. Whether it's a Rule 49 offer or not will depend on the criteria that is set out in the r ules and whatever judge adjudicates on it. I didn't really get into that though I heard an active debate about all so that. From my point of view, I was, I, I think I had simply put to you, Mr. Obagi, that I, I might, and I might indeed enforce your motion but I would imply on it a release provision, or we would leave it to the Court to sort out if you withdrew your motion. You decided the latter point, and I simply held out as an inducement that we just let&mdash;I could've said &ldquo;no costs&rdquo; and walked out, which I should've probably. But I said &ldquo;costs in the cause&rdquo; and walked out. So truly, I was not intended to do anything other than to put those into the pot of the rest of the costs. I wasn't intending to restrain Judge McLean. And if that results in Judge McLean hearing, you know, as, one sort of sub issue who was right or wrong in that motion I think that's, that's too bad, but I think it's probably a reality that that's a possibility. The trial judge has the overall control, doesn't he, of all the costs of t he action. [sic!]</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>(b)</N><TI>Success in the Proceeding / Offers to Settle</TI>
<P>34. The Plaintiffs were successful in obtaining a Judgment greater than the amounts for which the Plaintiffs attempted to settle the action prior to the commencement of trial yet the trial judge gave no consideration to this success in the award of costs.</P>
<P>35. Prior to the commencement of trial, the Plaintiffs made various offers to settle, including:
<P1>(a) an offer to settle the action as against the McEwens for the amount of their insurance limit of $1,000,000. This offer was made six (6) days before the comme ncement of trial; and</P1>
<P1>(b) offers to settle against all defendants in amounts from $1,856,280 to $1,950,000 plus costs.</P1>
<P1>Offers to Settle Brief with Chart and Offers; Appeal Book and Compendium Tab 26, pp. 151&ndash;155 and Tabs 27&ndash;337.</P1></P>
<P>36. The offers made by the Plaintiffs were <UNDER>lower than</UNDER> the eventual Judgment.</P>
<P>37. The trial judge was then asked by the Defendants to consider the potential future value of accident benefits. The Judgment had not even been paid and no assignment granted. Notwi thstanding this incorrect approach to costs, the experts on behalf of both parties agreed that the Plaintiffs had beaten their offers to settle, <UNDER>even when the full present value of future SABS were taken into account</UNDER>. The Defendants' expert made the following admissions:
<P1>(a) with respect to the Plaintiffs' offer to settle for $1,000,000 with the McEwen Defendants, the offer beat the jury verdict; and</P1>
<P1>(b) with respect to the Plaintiffs' offer to settle for $1,856,280, the offer beat the jury verdict by $10,486.00 <UNDER>using all of her own assumptions and the deduction of the full present value of SABS</UNDER>. Using the Plaintiffs' expert assumptions, the Defendants' expert admitted that the Plaintiffs' offer beat the jury verdict by $170,000.</P1>

<P>38. In the Defendants previous submissions before this Honourable Court, the Defendants have attempted to refer to the inaccurate valuations of future accident benefits by their expert, <UNDER>prior</UNDER> to cross-examination, which inflates the values. In the previous factums and submissions, the Defendants have (a) referred to a document provided by Aviva (as accident benefits insurer) prior to trial regarding the valuation of benefits which all experts acknowledged was wrong; and (b) submitted that the value of benefits was somewhere between &ldquo;$760,511 and $813,748.&rdquo; The Defendants own expert admitted these numbers were wrong in cross-examination. Any attempt to use the uncorrected evidence of the Defendants' expert, Maryse Larouche, prior to corrections made in cross-examination, is entirely improper and misleading to this Honourable Court.

<P>39. The trial judge did not to consider the $1,000,000.00 offer to the McEwens in his Reasons for Decision. This offer was $1,610,774.32 less than the Judgment. Defence counsel admitted on behalf of his expert that it was &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; that this offer beats the jury verdict. It is plain and obvious that this offer ought to have been accepted by the McEwens yet the trial judge did not even refer to the offer in his determination of costs.
<P1>Cross-Examination of Maryse Larouche, February 25, 2016 at Q. 1022-1023; Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 39, p. 190.</P1></P>
<P>40. With respect to the Plaintiffs' joint offers to settle, the trial judge determined that these offers were also beaten by the jury verdict. The Plaintiffs' offer to settle of $1,856,250.00 was:
<P1>(a) $754,494.32 less than the verdict; and</P1>
<P1>(b) $154,750.00 less than the insurance limits of the Defendants.</P1>

<P>41. The Defendants <UNDER>never offered</UNDER> their insurance limits ($2,000,000) to settle this action. <UNDER>All</UNDER> of the Plaintiffs' offers were <UNDER>under</UNDER> the insurance limits. None were accepted. The Defendants have <UNDER>now paid</UNDER> their insurance limits (and not the balance of the Judgment). The Plaintiffs have now recovered more in damages than <UNDER>all</UNDER> the offers to settle.

<BLOCK3><N>(c)</N><TI>Discoveries of the Plaintiff Barbara Carroll at the outset of trial</TI>
<P>42. Barbara Carroll had a litigation guardian&mdash;her daughter Shannon. The Defendants proceeded with examination for discovery of the litigation guardian. The action was set down for trial. All parties agreed to a fixed trial date. All parties agreed that discoveries were complete. No orders were requested or made for continuing examinations for discovery. After the matter was set down for trial, new counsel for Pilot/Aviva communicated with Plaintiffs' counsel. The subject matter of those conversations were disputed. Counsel for Aviva alleged that he was told that calling Barbara Carroll at trial would not serve any useful purpose. It is agreed by all parties that no undertakin g was given not to call Barbara Carroll as a witness. This is confirmed by counsel for the Pilot/Aviva ten (10) months prior to trial (although this affidavit was only served at trial).

<P>43. The Defendants objected to Barbara Carroll testifying at trial and brought a motion at the outset of trial to conduct an examination for discovery of Barbara Carroll or, in the alternative, an Order that Barbara Carroll not be permitted to testify. The trial judge refused to permit the Plaintiffs to cross-examine the counsel for Pilot/Aviva (not trial counsel) on his affidavit.

<P>44. No evidence was advanced by any party that any discussions took place at examinations for discovery regarding whether Barbara Carroll would testify at trial. Despite this lack of evidentiary foundation, the trial judge reached following conclusions:
<QUOTE><P>Apparently, some while ago discoveries were held and it was indicated to defence counsel that Ms. Carroll would not be testifying at trial. Ms. Carroll was represented, at that t ime, by a litigation guardian, as she still is. The implication was that the litigation guardian should be examined, and really Ms. Carroll would not be helpful as a witness.</P>
<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>The difficulty we have is that during the prior discoveries the indication, at least, was given to defence counsel that she would not testify, and that she really could not say anything helpful to the court. It would seem that no formal undertaking was given that she not testify. However, we have to look at the context of this litigation. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>

<P>45. In his costs decision, the trial judge makes a finding that the Defendants' counsel were told that Barbara Carroll &ldquo;would not be called as she could not give useful evidence.&rdquo; No such undertaking was ever given or even alleged at trial.

<P>46. The case conference endorsement of Master McLeod applied to <UNDER>all</UNDER> parties. The trial judge makes no mention of the late reports of the Defendants, including:
<P1>(a) the Defendants' mid-trial life expectancy report changed the life expectancy from a five year reduction to a nine year reduction based upon information available since 2012. Due to the timing, the Plaintiffs were unable to retain an expert in response;</P1>
<P1>(b) the Defendants served their first future care report only three weeks prior to the trial date (and approximately <UNDER>three years</UNDER> after the first Future Care Report of the Plaintiffs); and</P1>
<P1>(c) the Defendants did not serve any accident reconstruction reports until one month after the Plaintiffs even though the Defendants had the reverse onus to disprove negligence.</P1>

<BLOCK4><N>B.</N><TI><EM>Future Care</EM></TI>
<P>47. The trial judge referred to the updated report of the Plaintiffs' future care expert and stated that it contained &ldquo;new information which certainly made matters more expensive and required further consideration of their position by the Defendants.&rdquo; This was not correct. The annual future care costs claims of the Plaintiffs <UNDER>decreased</UNDER> from the original report. The original report (2012) assessed the annual future care needs of Barbara Carroll at $247,539.15 with various options and the second report assessed her annual future care needs at $218,286.11 with various options.

<P>48. The trial judge criticized a letter from Plaintiffs' Counsel which stated that, &ldquo;Ms. Carroll continues to reside in Stillwater Retirement Residence and I do not believe her needs have changed substantially.&rdquo; No evidence was called that this information was incorrect as of the date of the letter (May 2015). In fact, the defence position at trial was that recommendations of intensive therapy were made by the treatment team was &ldquo;all of a sudden&rdquo; in July and August 2015.

According to the Defendants' own future care expert, Barbara Carroll had made &ldquo;some progress&rdquo; since the accident but that &ldquo;the progress has not been incredible in terms of function.&rdquo; She did not think that Barbara Carroll was &ldquo;going to make an incredible amount of progress.&rdquo; It was her evidence that there was &ldquo;not much&rdquo; and &ldquo;very little&rdquo; difference between her recommendations in August 2015 and the first future care report of the Plaintiffs in 2012.

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Issue"><N>#1</N><TI>The trial judge erred in awarding an assignment of accident benefits at trial</TI>
<P>50. This Honourable Court is faced with conflicting judicial decisions regarding the proper interpretation of s.267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. The seminal decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF> outlines the basic principles dealing with collateral benefit legislation. The reasoning in <EM>Bannon</EM> has been applied and adopted for s.267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> in other Court of Appeal decisions, namely <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Fonseca v. Hansen</SOC></CASEREF>. It is the Plaintiffs' position that the reasoning and statutory interpretation contained in this line of cases is correct.</P>
<P>51. It is a principle of statutory interpretation that courts are to respect the intent of the Legislature as much as possible, and therefore a section of a statute should be read to comply with the legislative text, promote the legislative purpose, and produce a reasonable and just meaning. The <EM>Insurance Act</EM> and its regulations are remedial legislation and should receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of its objects.

<P>52. Generally, there are two competing interests when addressing deductibility and assignment of collateral benefits: (a) the Plaintiff should not receive double recovery; and (b) the Plaintiff should receive full compensation and not recover less than that to which he or she is entitled.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 4486</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <UNDER>at p. 33, Appellants' Book of Authorities. Tab 1</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>53. It is also important to interpret the legislative provisions in a manner that is going to promote access to justice and proportionality. The <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF> principles provide flexibility to litigants to narrow the areas of disagreement for the purpose of a tort trial (particularly if a plaintiff has been fully compensated for some losses by a collateral source).</P>
<P>54. If a party has received full compensation for past loss of income from a collateral source, a statutory interpretation that <UNDER>requires</UNDER> them to advance claims for those losses to avoid a deduction or assignment relating to different claims is not an interpretation that should be favoured. It is illogical to force plaintiffs to litigate past losses simply to avoid an unfair deduction or assignment of past losses from future losses. Similarly, if a party is receiving full compensation for attendant care claims, they should not be forced to make claims for attendant care simply to avoid a deduction from medical or rehabilitation claims, covered under separate limits of insurance.</P>
<P>55. In simple cases where most medical and rehabilitation claims are paid by the collateral source, a litigant should be able to advance claims only for the portion of loss not compensated by the collateral source, such as a denied home renovation claim. Otherwise, the party would have to litigate every single claim already compensated by the collateral source to obtain recovery for the one expense which was not paid. Lawsuits that ought to be simple and straightforward will become unnecessarily lengthy and complicated for no identifiable purpose.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>Deduction of Collateral Benefits</TI>
<P>56. Section 267.8 addresses the deductions available for income loss and health care expenses. These provisions state that the amount of damages for these items should be reduced by all payments that the plaintiff received or that were available in respect of those damages. In particular, the deduction of statutory accident benefits specifically refers back to the damages awarded. For example:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>267.8</N>
<SSEC><N>(1)</N><SSECP>In an action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile, the damages for income loss and loss of earning capacity shall be reduced by the following amounts:
<PARA><N>1.</N><PARAP>all payments in respect of the incident that the plaintiff has received or that were available before the trial of the action for statutory accident benefits in respect of <BOLD><UNDER>the</UNDER></BOLD> income loss and loss of earning capacity. (Emphasis added)</PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>57. It is noteworthy that the Legislature specifically linked the benefit payments to the damages awarded. The Legislature did not state that all payments for income loss are to be deducted. The Legislature stated that all payments for <BOLD><UNDER>the</UNDER></BOLD> income loss are to be deducted. Similar wording is used in section 267(4) for health care expenses (i.e. ...in respect of <BOLD><UNDER>the</UNDER></BOLD> expenses for health care).</P>
<P>58. The intention of the Legislature was to deduct only those payments which relate to the specific damages awarded at trial. Not all income loss benefits are to be deducted from income loss damages. Similarly, not all health care benefits are to be deducted from damages awarded for health care. The benefits must relate to the particular damage award, otherwise the word &ldquo;<UNDER>the</UNDER>&rdquo; becomes superfluous.</P>
<P>59. The Supreme Court of Canada recognizes that there is a general presumption against tautology in statutory interpretation. It is presumed that the Legislature avoids superfluous or meaningless words, that it does not pointlessly repeat itself or speak in vain. Every word in a statute is presumed to make sense and to have a specific role to play in advancing the legislative purpose. The presumption carries &ldquo;considerable weight.&rdquo; It is rebuttable when it can be shown the words do not serve a function, or that the words were added for greater certainty.

<P>60. The interpretation of the provision which would give meaning to the specific words used by the Legislature is consistent with the principles laid out in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF>. The policy rationale is to ensure there is no duplication in a tort judgment and receipt of SABS. An &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; approach furthers that objective without eroding principles of full compensation to the Plaintiff.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 4486</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF> p.29, Appellant's Book of Authorities, Tab 1</P1></P>
<P>61. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF>, this Honourable Court held that there is a requirement that the jury's award mirror the collateral benefit such that the statutory accident benefit must be deducted from a head of damage or type of loss <UNDER>akin</UNDER> to that for which the benefits were intended to compensate. A collateral benefit which may not &ldquo;truly overlap with the sums recovered in a tort judgment&rdquo; should not be unfairly deducted from the damages.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC><CITE>[2015] OJ. No. 5573</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <UNDER>at para 43-44; Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 5</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>62. The decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> outlines the requirement that there must be both a <UNDER>temporal</UNDER> matching (same time period) as well as a <UNDER>qualitative</UNDER> matching (compensating for the same loss).</P>
<P>63. This Honourable Court revisited this issue in the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Fonseca v. Hansen</SOC></CASEREF> and held that the damages must mirror the collateral benefit&mdash;temporally and qualitatively.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Fonseca v. Hansen</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 299 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>104&ndash;107</PARANUM></CASEREF><UNDER>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 6</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>64. It has been stated that s. 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> is a codification of the principles of <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF>. The Plaintiff agrees. Unfortunately, the interpretation of that codification is at i ssue. It is the Plaintiffs's position that the Legislature specifically codifies that the deduction against a damage award must be for SABS relating to <UNDER>the</UNDER> particular income loss and <UNDER>the</UNDER> health care expense to which the damages relate. The comparison of the benefits to the damages must be made on both a <UNDER>temporal</UNDER> basis as well as a <UNDER>qualitative</UNDER> basis.</P>
<P>65. Unfortunately, confusion has arisen as courts have not given meaning to the specific wording of the provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. This Honourable Court has not been asked to evaluate the fact that these provisions refer only to benefits in respect of &ldquo;<UNDER>the</UNDER>&rdquo; tort award. In fact, the interpretation adopted by this Honourable Court in both <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF> as well as <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long</SOC></CASEREF> adopt an interpretation which would place no meaning on the word &ldquo;<UNDER>the</UNDER>&rdquo; and reads the provision as if the word is omitted. This distinction does not appear to have been argued in either case.

<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>Implications of the Interpretations</TI>
<P>66. The &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; interpretation of the legislation, which is consistent with <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Fonseca v. Hansen</SOC></CASEREF>, enhances the likelihood that the plaintiff is fully compensated while avoiding double recovery. Benefits that are matched to the actual damages awarded on both a <UNDER>temporal</UNDER> as well as a <UNDER>qualitative</UNDER> basis will ensure that the benefits actually overlap the tort award.</P>
<P>67. This approach also provides flexibility to litigants to recognize that claims which are fully compensated from collateral sources need not be advanced. Litigants would not be compelled to advance past income loss claims if they are not seeking damages for past income loss. It would enable litigants to pursue only claims for which they are seeking damages from the tort defendant. It also permits judges to ensure that only deductions for the particular claims p ursued are made. It promotes reasonableness and efficiency rather than a proliferation of claims at trial.</P>
<P>68. Proportionality has become fundamentally important in litigation in recent years. All levels of court are demanding proportionality. It is contrary to proportionality to require litigants to pursue claims for which a collateral source has fully compensated them. It is contrary to proportionality to require litigants to pursue claims simply to avoid an unfair deduction or assignment rather than for the purpose of seeking damages from the tortfeasor.</P>
<P>69. Flexibility and reasonableness should be encouraged in the judicial system particularly as the plain language of the legislation supports such an interpretation. Parties should be encouraged to continue the practice of narrowing issues in dispute. This Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>El Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF> appears to have approved of the practice of advancing &ldquo;net claims&rdquo; only at trial or the ability of plaintiffs to frame their claims to address only the amounts actually in dispute:
<QUOTE><P>In <EM>Bannon</EM>, the plaintiffs did not seek recovery of benefits already provided to them by their no-fault insurer; their claims were presented net of those benefits. Nevertheless, the appellants in that case argued that the payments still had to be deducted from the damage award in the tort claim. The result in <EM>Bannon</EM> is not surprising; where the claim was presented net of no-fault payments, any further deduction would have amounted to a <UNDER>double counting of the no-fault benefits</UNDER>. <UNDER>[Emphasis added]</UNDER></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>52</PARANUM></CASEREF><UNDER>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 9</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>70. An interpretation that demands the rigid deduction or assignment of benefits without attempting to match the benefits to the damages awarded would eliminate the possibility of such an approach.</P>
<P>71. <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF> confirmed the availability of a &ldquo;Cox and Carter&rdquo; order for future benefits under s.267(l) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>. As stated in <EM>El Khodr</EM>, the provisions contained in s. 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> providing for assignments of collateral benefits are a codification of the &ldquo;Cox and Carter&rdquo; order. As such, the same general principles outlined in <EM>Bannon</EM> relating to future collateral benefits should be applicable under the current legislation. The Supreme Court affirmed that it is presumed, in the absence of a clear provision to the contrary, that the Legislature does not intend to change existing law or to depart from established principles, polic ies or practices.

<P>72. With respect to the implications of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC></CASEREF>, caution is required in transposing principles contained in the B.C. legislation to the Ontario legislation. The B.C. legislation contained a very specific provision that &ldquo;[a] person who has a claim for damages and who receives or is entitled to receive benefits respecting the claim, is deemed to have released the claim to the extent of the benefits.&rdquo; As noted in the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>El Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF>, the equivalent provision in the Ontario legislation was removed from the legislation in 1990. The current legislation has no such provision. Given that the applicable provision was expressly removed from the legislation, the interpretation of deductibility of benefits contained in <EM>Gurniak</EM> is not applicable to the statutory provisions at issue in the within appeals.

<P1>Insurance Act, R. S. O. 1980, c. 218., s.s. 239(2) [version not available on Canlii]</P1></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>Trust and Assignment Provisions</TI>
<P>73. Unlike the deduction provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, the assignment provisions do not mandate the nature or scope of the assignment or trust. The provisions provide for determination by arbitration (trust provisions) or discretion of the trial judge (assignment). Unlike the deduction provisions, which specifically mandate the deductions to be applied, the trust and assignment provisions simply provide that &ldquo;a plaintiff who recovers damages&rdquo; will be impressed with a trust, or subject to an assignment, in respect of future collateral benefits. The trust provisions mandate that the any resulting dispute be determined by way of arbitration while the assignment provisions are subject to judicial discretion &ldquo;subject to any conditions the court considers just.&rdquo;</P>
<P>74. With respect to the trust provisions contained in the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, a plaintiff who recovers damages for income loss, loss of earning capacity, expenses that have been or will be incurred for health care, or other pecuniary loss in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile shall hold <UNDER>all</UNDER> payments relating to <UNDER>all</UNDER> collateral benefits in trust. The legislation enumerates the types of collateral benefits available. The legislation requires the plaintiff to hold the money in trust for the b enefit of persons from whom &ldquo;damages were recovered&rdquo; in proportions that those persons paid &ldquo;the damages.&rdquo; Disputes relating to the &ldquo;plaintiff's liability to make payments&rdquo; are referred to arbitration.
<P1><UNDER>Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990. c.I.8. s.267.8(9)-(11)</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>75. The assignment provisions contained in s. 267.8(12) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, on the other hand, use permissive, rather than mandatory, language:
<QUOTE><SEC><N>267.8</N>
<SSEC><N>(12)</N><SSECP>The court that heard and determined the action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of the automobile, on motion, <BOLD>may order that, subject to any conditions the court considers just</BOLD>,
<PARA><N>(a)</N><PARAP>the plaintiff who recovered damages in the action <BOLD>assign to the defendants or the defendants' insurers all rights in respect of all payments to which the plaintiff who recovered damages</BOLD> is entitled in respect of the incident after the trial of the action,
<SPARA><N>(i)</N><SPARAP>for statutory accident benefits in respect of income loss...;...</SPARAP></SPARA>
<SPARA><N>(iv)</N><SPARAP>for statutory accident benefits in respect of expenses for health care...;...</SPARAP></SPARA></PARAP></PARA></SSECP></SSEC></SEC></QUOTE></P>
<P>76. The assignment provision also requires recovery of the damages as a precondition of any assignment. This makes logical and practical sense as there is no potential for double recovery unless the judgment is paid in full. It was an error of law for the trial judge to order an assignment in the present case given that the Defendants have failed to pay the Judgment. Recovery of the damages awarded is a necessary precondition to an assignment. This is particularly concerning since the trial judge acknowledged in his Reasons for Decision that it is unlikely that the Defendants will ultimately pay the Judgment. The necessary preconditions were not met to grant an assignment.</P>
<P>77. The Plaintiffs are not disputing that a trial judge could, under different circumstances, award an assignment of all payments for each of the enumerated benefits if such assignment is warranted and matches <UNDER>the</UNDER> damages which were awarded at trial. However, the provision does not provide an automatic right to such an assignment and the discretion must be exercised judicially.</P>
<P>78. Matching is required on several bases. Technically, the language of the assignment provisions does not import a requirement that the assignment be limited to the amount of damages and provides little guidance. It is logical to make reference to the deduction provisions which are contained in</P>
<P>79. There must be some matching of the collateral benefit to the damages awarded. The legislation cannot be literally interpreted as requiring an assignment of <UNDER>all</UNDER> payments for <UNDER>all</UNDER> the enumerated categories irrespective of the actual damages recovered. It would be an absurd interpretation to permit a tortfeasor to recover more in collateral benefits by assignment than the tortfeasor was required to pay in damages. There must be a matching of benefits beyond the express language of the legislation in order for the assignment to be fair and reasonable. A trial judge is required to consider whether the assignment, or the conditions to be placed upon the assignment, are &ldquo;just.&rdquo;</P>
<P>80. It is respectfully submitted that a just assignment must include a matching analysis to ensure that (a) the benefits <UNDER>temporally</UNDER> match the damages and (b) the benefits <UNDER>qualitatively</UNDER> match the damages. Justice requires a balancing of the interests of full compensation to the pl aintiff contrasted with a prevention of double recovery.</P>
<P>81. In dismissing the appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF>, this Honourable Court determined that a global jury award for &ldquo;future care costs&rdquo; that did not allocate damages to particular items of care was insufficient to secure an assignment, even where &ldquo;some overlap might be likely.&rdquo; It must be accurately determined what portion of the jury's future care costs mirrored expenses which the plaintiff continues to be entitled to claim under the SABS before an assi gnment could be granted.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC><CITE>[2015] OJ. No. 5573</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A</COURTJUR></CASEREF> para 47-48. Appellants' Book of Authorities. Tab 5.</P1></P>
<P>82. In the within action, the Defendants drafted the damages questions to the jury. The question directed the jury to give one lump sum amount for the value of &ldquo;future care costs.&rdquo; The Defendants could have asked the jury to detail the specific items of future care costs for which they intended to seek an assignment. They elected not to do so and for possibly good reasons. As a result, the duration and amount of damages for medical and rehabilitation services, as well as the duration and amount of damages awarded for attendant care, was never disclosed to the parties.</P>
<P>83. With respect to <UNDER>temporal</UNDER> matching, it is admitted by all parties that the attendant care benefits will be exhausted in 8.67 years post-trial. With respect to medical and rehabilitation benefits, the parties agreed they would be exhausted between 1.5 and 2.55 years post-trial. The damages awarded to the Plaintiff were awarded for her lifetime. It is unclear what damages correspond to the period of time which temporally match the SABS benefits sought to be assigned. While there may be &ldquo;some overlap&rdquo; the precise breakdown of the award for &ldquo;future care costs&rdquo; is unknown.</P>
<P>84. The Plaintiffs submit that the assignment should not rely on guesswork or assumptions. The heavy burden of establishing double recovery falls entirely upon the Defendants. They had the onus to demonstrate that the jury award compensated Barbara Carroll for the same loss. There is no way to determine with any certainty what the jury was intending to compensate. An assignment of all medical rehabilitation and attendant care benefits runs the risk that Barbara Carroll will receive less than full compensation for her loss.</P>
<P>85. The Defendants had every opportunity, if they wished to pursue an assignment, to ensure that the jury award was properly particularized. They chose not to do so. This decision is likely based upon the fact that the Defendants never intended to pay more than their insurance limits. They have yet to pay more than their insurance limits.</P>
<P>86. In agreeing to hear the motion as a hypothetical, the trial judge erred in failing to make a comparison between the jury verdict and the future accident benefits for which the assignment was sought. The trial judge purported to rely upon the &ldquo;indirect matching&rdquo; allegedly performed by Ms. Larouche. No such analysis appears in the record. None.</P>
<P>87. The &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison is required for the assignment of future accident benefits and the trial judge erred in failing to conduct the analysis. To the extent that the trial judge re lied upon a non-existent analysis conducted by Ms. Larouche, he committed a palpable and overriding error.</P>
<P>88. The Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>El Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF> expressly acknowledged that &ldquo;the present legislation does, to a limited extent, import a matching requirement.&rdquo; According to that decision, the matching is limited to the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; created by 267.8 (presumably referring to deduction provisions of s.267.8 as the assignment provisions simply list all potential assignments that could be made).
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>60</PARANUM></CASEREF><UNDER>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 9</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>89. Under the SABS, there are many categories of benefits. Section267.8 specifically enumerates three categories that can be assigned. The importance of the provision was not to create &ldquo;silos&rdquo; but to specifically exclude certain benefits from assignment, including non-earner benefits (Part III), caregiver benefits (Part IV), as well as death and funeral benefits (Part VII). Even if &ldquo;silos&rdquo; were created under the deduction provisions, they refer back to <UNDER>the</UNDER> specific damages which the plaintiff received and not <UNDER>all</UNDER> payments for loss of income or <UNDER>all</UNDER> payments for health care.</P>
<P>90. Flexibility in bringing claims for only amounts sought against the tortfeasor ought to be encouraged. An automatic deduction or assignment should not be given for <UNDER>all</UNDER> benefits in a category for the mere reason that they fall within a &ldquo;silo.&rdquo; This interpretation would require the plaintiff to litigate <UNDER>all</UNDER> damages even if fully compensated by a collateral source. If a party is only claiming for future income loss, a fair and reasonable assignment ought to be limited to benefits intended to compensate future income loss and then only to the extent that damages were actually awarded for future income loss. The intention of the legislation is to avoid double recovery and this objective can be met by ensuring that the deduction or assignment is restricted to a collateral benefit which matches, both <UNDER>temporally</UNDER> and <UNDER>qualitatively</UNDER>, the damages awarded.</P>
<P>91. Lastly, the Defendants have still not satisfied the Judgment amount. The legislation does not permit an assignment until payment has been made. This requirement makes practical sense as there is no potential for &ldquo;double recovery&rdquo; until the tortfeasor(s) pays the judgment. The Defendants should not be permitted, in these circumstances, to seek an advance ruling of their legal entitlement in the event of some hypothetical future conduct. The fact t hat they have yet to pay the Judgment, now nearly 2&nbsp;<TEXTFRAC>1/2</TEXTFRAC>years post-verdict, underlines the hypothetical nature of these issues.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>Attempted settlement of &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo;</TI>
<P>95. The trial judge erred in law in penalizing the Plaintiffs in costs for a motion which was cau sed by the Defendants making an offer to settle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; and then, <UNDER>only after the offer was accepted</UNDER>, disclosing that the offer to settle was intended to also include matters outside of the proceeding. The trial judge characterized the Defendants' offer as an &ldquo;unenforceable offer.&rdquo; Yet the Plaintiffs bore the severe consequences of having accepted the &ldquo;unenforceable offer.&rdquo;</P>
<P>96. The Plaintiffs state that the offer to settle which was accepted was clear and plain on its face and related to &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; only. The Defendants took the position that their offer, though worded as pertaining to &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; only, encompassed a bad faith dispute as well as past accident benefits. This raised additional issues as the Defendants had made a similar o ffer earlier in the action and had to admit that the earlier offer also attracted implied terms and conditions.</P>
<P>97. These offers were unfair to the Plaintiffs. Had the &ldquo;unenforceable offer&rdquo; not been accepted, the Defendants would have unfairly and wrongfully been able to rely on rule 49 in seeking cost consequences. This raises real concerns of mischief that could be accomplished by permitting hidden terms to attach to an offer that are only disclosed upon acceptance of the offer .</P>
<P>98. Rule 49.02(1) states that &ldquo;a party to a proceeding may serve on any other party an offer to settle any one or more of the claims <UNDER>in the proceeding</UNDER> on the terms specified in the offer to settle.&rdquo; Form 49A contains the same wording as the Defendants's offer as follows:
<QUOTE><P>The (identified party) offers to settle <UNDER>this proceeding</UNDER> (or the following claims in this proceeding) on the following terms. [emphasis added]</P></QUOTE>
<P1><UNDER>Rule 1.06(2) and 49.02(1) and Form 49A of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></UNDER></P1></P>
<P>99. A claim in the proceeding is a claim included in the statement of claim.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Igbokwe v. HB Group Insurance Management Ltd.</SOC><CITE>[2001], 55 O.R. (3d) 313</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <UNDER>at para 8. Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 15</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>100. Offers that extend beyond claims in the proceeding, including the requirement for a full and final settlement of all claims that a plaintiff may have against a defendant, whether pertaining to the proceeding or not, do not qualify as Rule 49 offers.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Amyotte v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>[2013] O.J. No. 3321</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. Div.Ct</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <UNDER>at para 14. Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 16</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>101. The Plaintiffs state that it is an error of law to interpret the wording of the offer to settle utilizing Rule 49 wording as including matters outside of the proceeding. It would place considerable uncertainty into the meaning of offers to settle served under Rule 49. These offers are intended to settle the matters in dispute in the proceeding <UNDER>only</UNDER>. Full and final releases of all issues between the parties are not required nor mandated by Rule 49. If the parties seek to resolve issues outside of the proceeding, the offers could and should specify that other issues are encompassed in the offer.</P>
<P>102. The Plaintiffs were legitimately concerned that the Defendants were requesting the motions judge to &ldquo;read-in&rdquo; terms into an accepted offer to settle while asserting that their previous offer (also to settle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo;) was a proper Rule 49 offer. On the motion before Hackland J, it was confirmed that all offers contained an implied terms requiring a full and final release of the bad faith claims and past accident benefits. Upon confirmation of the implied conditions in the previous offer, the Plaintiffs withdrew their motion and the parties proceeded to trial.</P>
<P>103. Despite receiving clarification that the Defendants' previous &ldquo;Rule 49&rdquo; offer of $1,757,500 required release of bad faith claims and past accident benefit claims, the Defendants proceeded, post-trial, to characterize the very same offer as a Rule 49 offer despite assurances on the motion before Hackland J that the offer contained implied conditions relating to matters outside the scope of &ldquo;this proceeding.&rdquo; This was the precise problem the Plaintiffs sought to clarify before Hackland, J. As the Defendants did not ultimately beat the offer, nor even the Plaintiffs' offers, the $1,757,500 offer became irrelevant for cost purposes but it certainly raises concerns regarding the potential abuse that could have occurred had the jury verdict been different.</P>
<P>104. The Plaintiffs obtained a Judgment in excess of the &ldquo;unenforceable offer.&rdquo; In addition, the Plaintiffs have not released any bad faith claims or claims for past accident benefits. The Plaint iffs have recovered over $2,000,000 in damages and $50,584 in past SABS. Their bad faith action is ongoing. The Defendants would have been well served to have accepted the settlement without insisting upon release of matters outside of this litigation.</P>
<P>105. The Plaintiffs state that it was ultimately the Defendants who were responsible for the failed settlement. If the Defendants had intended to make an offer encompassing the bad faith claims, past accident benefits or any other matters outside of &ldquo;this proceeding,&rdquo; they could have easily done so. Instead, they opted to use Rule 49 wording in their offer.</P>
<P>106. Vast uncertainty would arise if offers to settle using the actual wording of Rule 49 were then interpreted as including implied terms to resolve claims falling outside of the subject proceeding. The entire purpose of Rule 49 is to have offers which can be directly compared with the ultimate Judgment. Implied inclusion of claims outside of the proceeding renders that exerc ise impossible. A trial judge cannot and should not quantify the value of claims outside of the proceeding.
<P1><UNDER>Rule 49 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM></UNDER>.</P1></P>
<P>107. It was the Plaintiffs position that an offer to settle &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; is limited to the claims in &ldquo;this proceeding.&rdquo; It was a reasonable position based on the plain wording of the offer to settle and as well as the authority of this Honourable Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Igbokwe v. HB Group Insurance Management</SOC></CASEREF>.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Igbokwe v. HB Group Insurance Management</SOC><CITE>55 O.R. (3d) 313</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A</COURTJUR></CASEREF><UNDER>.Appellants' Book of Authorities. Tab 15</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>108. Bad faith claims against insurers are not claims for indemnity under the insurance contract. On the contrary, there is an independent duty of the utmost good faith which an insurer owes to an insured which is independent of and in addition to the breach of a contractual duty. A breach of the duty to act fairly and in good faith gives rise to a separate cause of action that is distinct from a cause of action under the insurance policy.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Dundas v. Zurich Canada</SOC><CITE>[2012] OJ No. 1321</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <UNDER>at para 49&ndash;51;Appellants' Book of Authorities. Tab 17</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>109. The correspondence between the parties prior to the failed settlement demonstrate that the parties recognized that the bad faith claims would be the subject matter of another legal action and a debate was already underway regarding who could act as counsel in that action. Irregardl ess, even if there was a misunderstanding, that misunderstanding was caused by the Defendants.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>Failure to Consider the Plaintiffs' Offers</TI>
<P>110. A trial judge is required to consider offers to settle, and Rule 49.13 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>, particularly in a case where offers to settle are close to the result.
<P1><UNDER>Rules 57.01(1) and 49.13 of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</UNDER></P1>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Elbakhiet v. Palmer</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 544</CITE></CASEREF><UNDER>.Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 18</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>111. The trial judge failed to consider the Plaintiffs' Offer to Settle against the McEwens (made six days before the commencement of trial and open until the last week of trial). The offer of $1M was unequivocally more favourable to the McEwen Defendants and ought to have been given significant weight by the trial judge.</P>
<P>112. In addition to the offer to settle as against the McEwens, the Plaintiffs made joint offers which were all within the combined insurance limits of the McEwens (Aviva) and the insurance limits under the OPCF44 policy of Barbara Carroll (Pilot/Aviva). The ultimate Judgment secured exceeded all of these offers.</P>
<P>113. Instead of considering the Plaintiffs' offers to settle to justify a higher costs award or penalizing the Defendants in any way for their failure to accept reasonable offers, the trial judge appears to have imposed a requirement that Plaintiffs not only beat their offers, but that they have to beat them by a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; margin simply to secure partial indemnity costs. In any event, the Judgment did exceed the offers by a substantial margin. The Plaintiffs have already received in damages $143,720.00 more than they were willing to accept in their joint Offer to Settle. The Plaintiffs have received $1,610,774.32 more than the Plaintiffs' Offer to Settle as against the McEwens. These numbers are substantial by any measure.</P>
<P>114. It is certainly curious that the McEwens did not accept the $1,000,000 Offer to Settle as against them despite the fact that the Defendants' joint offers clearly indicated that the insurance limits of the McEwens were exhausted. No explanation has ever been provided for this conduct. Why were two counsel at trial representing the McEwens? The Plaintiffs were forced to litigate an eight we ek trial against two sets of lawyers: Pilot/Aviva (represented by Ms. Neate) and the McEwens (represented by Mr. Nearing and Ms. Durant), also insured by Aviva. The trial judge ought to have considered the McEwens' failure to accept the Plaintiffs' offer o r at least question what reasonable basis existed for the McEwens to remain in this action in light of the offers made.</P>
<P>115. The trial judge further erred in stating that the joint offers were &ldquo;virtually all of the money available.&rdquo; Even if the Plaintiffs' claim in the McEwens' bankruptcy were disregarded, the combined insurance limits of the Defendants was $2M. <UNDER>All</UNDER> of the Plaintiffs' offers were within those insurance limits. The Plaintiffs were willing to accept $143,720 less than the combined insurance limits of the Defendants to resolve the action. The Defendants refused and have since paid out their insurance limits.</P>
<P>116. If the trial decision is left to stand, it essentially gives <EM>carte blanche</EM> to insurers to withhold their full insurance limits in claims that exceed those limits and then argue after trial that Plaintiffs should be penalized for obtaining a higher judgment that is not &ldquo;substantially more&rdquo; than the Plaintiffs' own offers. Beating one's own offer is a victory. It demonstrates that the Plaintiffs were acting reasonably and that the Defendants were not. The trial judge failed to give any weight to the Plaintiffs' offers, thereby penalizing the wrong party in costs..</P>
<P>117. The Defendants chose to force these Plaintiffs through an eight week trial. They gambled and lost. The result is a Judgment greater than the Plaintiffs' offers. Consequences ought to have followed and the Plaintiffs were entitled to their partial indemnity costs.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iv.</N><TI>Leave for examination for discovery of the Plaintiff Barbara Carroll at outset of trial</TI>
<P>118. Where an action is brought by a party under disability, the litigation guardian may be examined in place of the person under disability. At the option of the examining party, the person under disability may be examined. Parties who have consented for a matter to be set down for trial shall not initiate or continue any form of discovery without leave of the court.
<P1><UNDER>Rule 31.01 and Rule 31.03(5) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</UNDER></P1>
<P1><UNDER>Rule 48.04(1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>.</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>119. The Defendants brought a motion at trial requesting that Barbara Carroll to be excluded as a witness in her own trial. In the alternative they requested to conduct an examination for discovery.</P>
<P>120. The decisions of the trial judge indicate that he misapprehended the evidence and incorrectly, and without evidentiary foundation, determined there was a representation during examination for discoveries that Barbara Carroll would not be called as witness as she would not give useful evidence. No such representation was even argued at trial.</P>
<P>121. The Defendants position that they relied on alleged comments of Plaintiffs' counsel (supposedly made <UNDER>after</UNDER> completion of discoveries and after consenting to the matter being set down for trial), opining on the &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; of Barbara Carroll's evidence, to justify their failure to br ing a motion prior to trial was not tenable. In fact, ten (10) months prior to trial, the Defendants had turned their minds to the fact that there was no undertaking not to call Barbara Carroll as a witness at trial. They went so far as to put that information in an affidavit (which was not served until trial).</P>
<P>122. The Plaintiffs strenuously challenged the allegations of the Defendants. The trial judge denied the Plaintiffs' request to cross-examine upon the affidavit evidence. If allegations of misconduct were to be levelled against Plaintiffs' counsel, a reasonable opportunity to challenge the allegations ought to have been provided to the Plaintiffs. Ultimately, the Defendants ought to be blamed for their <UNDER>own decision</UNDER> to proceed to trial without examination for discovery of Barbara Carroll.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>v.</N><TI>The trial judge erred in failing to consider the failure of the Defendants to adhere to the case management time lines</TI>
<P>123. None of the parties to this litigation ultimately complied with the case management order with respect to expert reports. Both parties served late reports. The only evidence of prejudice was upon the Plaintiffs regarding the Defendants' mid-trial revised life expectancy report. The Plaintiffs would have retained a life expectancy expert to respond to this report if sufficient time had been provided for an expert to review and respond to the report prior to the conclusion of trial.</P>
<P>124. As for the future care reports, even if one were to accept that there were significant changes between the Plaintiffs' two future care reports, it was irrelevant as the Defendants did not even have their own future care report completed and served until three weeks before trial (at the same time as the Plaintiffs' updated report). The Plaintiffs were not deserving of punishment in costs.</P>
<P>125. If adherence to time lines are considered, it was an error for the trial judge not to consider the conduct and time lines of both counsel in an even handed manner.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>vi.</N><TI>Conclusion on Costs</TI>
<P>126. The trial judge's approach to costs demonstrates significant errors in principle which justify intervention by this Honourable Court. In addition, a costs award which denies partial indemn ity costs to a party who was willing to settle for substantially less than the Judgment secured at trial is so plainly wrong that it ought to be set aside as both punitive and unfair to the Plaintiffs.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2></BLOCK1>
<BLOCK1><TI TOCID="V">PART V&mdash;ORDER SOUGHT</TI>
<P>127. The Plaintiffs (Appellants in Appeal) respectfully request that this Honourable Court grant the within appeal and Order that:
<P1>(a) the assignment of statutory accident benefits be set aside;</P1>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Appellants' appeal has two objectives: to obtain double recovery for future health care expenses to which they are already entitled under statutory accident benefits and, (if leave to appeal is granted) to avoid the costs consequences of their conduct of the action.</P>
<P>2. This action arises from a pedestrian/motor vehicle accident on May 28, 2009, in which the Plaintiff/Appellant Barbara Carroll sustained a catastrophic brain injury.</P>
<P>3. The maximum risk to the Defendants in the action and the total possible recovery by the Plaintiffs was $2,000,000 plus costs. The Respondent McEwens declared bankruptcy in 2011 and obtained an Absolute Discharge on June 18, 2012, except for an amount up to the $1,000,000 limit of their insurance coverage. There was a further $1,000,000 available by virtue of the Appellant Barbara Carroll's OPCF44 endorsement with the Respondent Aviva.</P>
<P>4. After an 8 week trial, the jury found that Barbara Carroll was 38% at fault for the accident and (taking into account the apportionment of liability), assessed her damages at $2,418,000 plus interest. Of that amount, $2,232,000 related to the cost of future care. Damages were awarded to the other Plaintiffs for <EM>Family Law Act</EM> claims. The total verdict was $2,610,774.32.</P>
<P>5. Following the jury's verdict, the trial Judge made two orders that are the subject of the appeal.</P>
<P>6. First, he ordered that the future accident benefits payable to Ms. Carroll under the statutory benefits scheme should be assigned to the Defendants upon payment of the judgment against them. The trial Judge made this order to prevent double recovery. He was satisfied that the Defendants had discharged a &ldquo;very strict onus of proof&rdquo; and that &ldquo;on the evidence it is patently clear that the preconditions for an appropriate assignment have been made out&rdquo;: para. 10 of the Reasons of the trial Judge.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean at para. 10 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 21 and 22].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. The Respondent McEwens' position is that this discretionary order is supported by sound legal principle and by findings of fact that are not tainted by any reviewable error.</P>
<P>8. Second, the trial Judge reduced the Plaintiffs' claimed costs by more than 50% by virtue of the conduct of the Plaintiffs' solicitors. The Judge found that going to trial had resulted in little, if any, practical benefit to the Plaintiffs; that their solicitors' conduct had unnecessarily extended the proceedings and that they had tried to trick the Defendants by accepting an offer to settle the proceedings while, a minute later, serving the Defendant Aviva with a $2,000,000 claim for bad faith.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean at paras.45, 48, 49 and 50 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 31 and 32]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The Respondent McEwens' position is that leave to appeal this discretionary order should be denied as the Judge made no error in principle and the order is not plainly wrong.</P>
<P>10. The Respondent McEwens are not pursuing any cross-appeal with respect to the trial Judge's costs order.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>11. The Respondent McEwens accept the facts as stated in paragraphs 12, 21, 22 and 32 of the Plaintiffs' (Appellants) Statement of Facts.</P>
<P>12. The Plaintiffs initiated proceedings against the Defendants (Respondents) Robert McEwen and Caroline McEwen (the driver and owner of the motor vehicle). The Plaintiffs also sued their own insurer, the Respondent Aviva Canada Inc. (&ldquo;Aviva&rdquo;), pursuant to the OPCF 44 Family Protection Endorsement in Barbara Carroll's motor vehicle insurance policy. Aviva's exposure under Barbara Carroll's OPCF44 endorsement was $1,000,000 inclusive of interests and costs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim issued March 25, 2011 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 8, pages 43 to 58].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. The McEwens' insurance policy limits were $1,000,000, inclusive of prejudgment interest. The McEwens had declared bankruptcy in 2012. The Plaintiffs' claim was listed as a liability in their bankruptcy.</P>
<P>14. The McEwens were given an absolute discharge from their bankruptcy in June 2012. The Carrolls' solicitors obtained an Order from the Registrar in Bankruptcy enabling them to continue with the action but only to the extent of the limits of McEwens' policy.</P>
<P>15. Throughout these proceedings, the Plaintiffs' solicitor maintained the position that they had a right to take proceedings for further recovery against the McEwens over and above the limits of the McEwens' insurance policy, a position that has no basis in law.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>McEwen Insurance Declaration, Exhibit Book Vol. 2, pages 514 to 518 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 1, page 1]</BOLD>; Certificate of Absolute Discharge of the Bankruptcy of the McEwens dated June 18, 2012 Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, pages 704 to 710 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 2, pages 8 and 10]</BOLD>; Order of Master Pierre E. Roger dated October 12, 2002 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 5, pages 35 to 37]</BOLD>; Email from Joseph Obagi to Kevin Nearing dated September 7, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, pages 180 and 181 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 3, page 13]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The Appellants have abandoned the Appeal with respect to the trial Judge's Decision prohibiting the Plaintiffs from claiming under the Defendants' bankruptcy, for any shortfall in the satisfaction of the resulting judgment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Appeal dated June 16, 2016, <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 1, page 3, at paras.(h) and (i)]</BOLD>; Revised Plaintiffs' Factum, para.7 at page 3.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>17. The maximum realistic recovery for the Plaintiffs was thus the limits of the insurance coverage, plus costs, and the maximum risk to the Defendants in the action was the same: $2,000,000 plus costs.</P>
<P>18. There were two main issues at trial: liability and Barbara Carroll's claim for damages for the cost of future care.</P>
<P>19. Liability was a serious issue as witnessed by the jury's verdict dividing liability 62/38% in the Plaintiffs' favour.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Jury Questions answered October 30, 2015 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 24, page 145].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>20. With respect to the claim for damages for the cost of future care, by the time of trial, Barbara Carroll had already used $1,011,045 of the $2,000,000 of available accident benefits for attendant care and medical and rehabilitation benefits.</P>
<P>21. Prior to trial, the Defendants had served a motion for an assignment, <EM>inter alia</EM>, of future statutory accident benefits in respect of expenses for health care.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Notice of Motion dated August 28, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 4, pages 15 to 17]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>22. After the jury was selected and opening statements were made, and before any evidence was called, the Defendants served a time-limited offer dated September 11, 2015, to settle the Plaintiffs' claim for $2,150,000 inclusive of all damages, prejudgment interest and costs.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Offer to Settle of the Defendants September 11, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 2, page 530 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 36, page 177]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>23. The offer did not request any assignment of the remaining future health care expenses available to Barbara Carroll through her accident benefits insurer. At the start of trial, the information provided by the Plaintiffs' solicitors was that Barbara Carroll had $988,955 of remaining health care expenses available to her from her accident benefits insurer. On its face, the Defendants' offer had an apparent value in excess of $3,000,000.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Elizabeth Quigley to Kevin Nearing dated August 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, pages 1161 and 1162 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 5, pages 19 and 20].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>24. One minute after purporting to accept the offer, the Plaintiffs served counsel for Aviva with a brand new statement of claim in which they sought punitive damages and damages for bad faith in the amount of $2,000,000. The Defendants advised the Plaintiffs' counsel that their offer was intended to settle all litigation and that, if the Plaintiffs were not prepared to release the Defendants of any and all claims, they were not prepared to proceed with a $2,150,000 settlement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Sutherland and Ms. Neate dated September 11, 2015 serving new Statement of Claim, Exhibit Book, page 229 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 6, page 21]</BOLD>; Letter from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Nearing and Mr. Sutherland dated September 11, 2015 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 32, page 169]</BOLD>; Email from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Nearing, Mr. Sutherland and Stephanie Neate sent September 11, 2015, at 4:24 p.m ., Exhibit Book, page 268 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 7, pages 22 and 23]</BOLD>; Email from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Sutherland and Ms. Neate sent September 11, 2015, at 4: 25 p.m., Exhibit Book, pages 271 and 272 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 8, pages 24 and 25].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. The Plaintiffs' solicitors then brought a Motion to enforce the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;. This led to a hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015. The Plaintiffs ultimately withdrew their Motion to enforce the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; and proceeded to trial.</P>
<P>26. The jury assessed Barbara Carroll's cost of future care claim at $3,600,000. After reducing the award by Barbara Carroll's contributory negligence of 38%, the net amount awarded for Barbara Carroll's cost of future care claim was $2,232,000.</P>
<P>27. The jury questions were the result of back and forth negotiations between counsel. The mutually agreed upon proposed questions were accepted by the trial Judge and given to the jury. The wording proposed by the Defendants was amended. With respect to future care costs, the parties and the trial Judge agreed upon a question that put all future care costs in one question.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Defendants' proposed jury questions <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 25, pages 147 and 149];</BOLD> Jury verdict <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 24, pages 145 and 146].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>28.

<P>29. With respect to costs, the trial Judge concluded that the Plaintiffs had achieved little or no benefit by proceeding to trial.

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Assignment of Accidents Benefits for Health Care Expenses</UNDER></TI>
<P>30. After the jury verdict, the Defendants sought an order for the assignment of future health care expenses upon payment of the judgment. The purpose of the assignment is to prevent double recovery where it is clear that the damages awarded at trial duplicate the amounts covered by the statutory benefits for health care expenses.</P>
<P>31. Based on the evidence summarized below, the trial Judge concluded that there was no doubt that Barbara Carroll would receive all of the outstanding statutory accident benefits for health care expenses; that the Defendants had met the applicable onus of proof; and that &ldquo;based on that evidence, it is patently clear that the preconditions for an appropriate assignment had been made out&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean at paras. 10 and 11 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 21 and 22]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>32. Because she had suffered a catastrophic impairment, Barbara Carroll had $2,000,000 of accident benefits available to her for health care expenses: $1,000,000 for medical and rehabilitation expenses and $1,000,000 for attendant care expenses.</P>
<P>33. As of the start of the trial, the information provided by the Plaintiffs' solicitors was that Barbara Carroll had already received $1,011,145 in health care expenses for medical/ rehabilitation benefits and attendant care, leaving a further $988,955 available to her.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Elizabeth Quigley to Kevin Nearing dated August 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol . 4, pages 1161 and 1162 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 5, pages 19 and 20]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>34. Subsequent information provided by the Plaintiffs' solicitors indicated that, as of the start of the trial, an additional $50,584 had been incurred but not yet paid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 2014, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, pages 1224 and 1229 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, pages 206 and 217].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> There was no dispute with respect to these additional health care expenses. The record demonstrates that some of these expenses had already been paid by the time the parties came before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015. There was never any attempt by the Defendants or any intention on their part to have the Plaintiffs release any claim to the health care expenses that had been incurred but not yet paid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 204, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1223 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, page 217].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>35. There was no evidence that there had been any dispute whatsoever with respect to any of Barbara Carroll's claim for accident benefits.</P>
<P>36. The vast majority of the evidence at trial was evidence with respect to Barbara Carroll's health care needs. As the trial Judge noted, there was substantial evidence led at trial, including the evidence of life care planners, caregivers and Barbara Carroll's occupational therapists.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean at paras.6, 9 and 10 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 21 and 22].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>37. During the hearing regarding the assignment and costs, evidence filed by the Defendants indicated that Barbara Carroll's available medical and rehabilitation accident benefits would be exhausted in 1.5 years from the start of the trial. The Plaintiffs' evidence was that the remaining medical and rehabilitation benefits would be consumed in 2.55 years from the start of the trial. The experts agreed that attendant care benefits would be exhausted in 8.67 years from the start of the trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Maryse Larouche dated February 5, 2016, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1182 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 61, page 564];</BOLD> Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1233 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, page 216].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The Plaintiffs' updated cost of future care report indicated that medical and rehabilitation services were going to be consumed at $81,552.85 a year and personal care services (attendant care) were going to be consumed at a rate of anywhere between $136,733.26 and $195,100.00 a year.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Future Care Report Summary for Tort dated August 18, 2015 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 59, page 555].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. After adjusting for the $50,084 of health care expenses incurred but not paid as of the start of trial, Ms. Larouche, the Defendants' actuary, calculated the present value of the remaining health care expenses for medical and rehabilitation services and attendant care at between $760,511 and $813,748.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Maryse Larouche sworn February 9, 2016, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, pages 1171 and 1172 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 45, pages 306 and 307 at paras.6 and 7].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>40. Ms. Larouche's calculations and the calculations of Mr. Principe, the Plaintiffs' accountant, resulted in the identical figure for attendant care: $623,893. They differed slightly with respect to medical/rehabilitation benefits. Ms. Larouche calculated a figure of $274,180 to $277,895 whereas Mr. Principe calculated a figure of $263,714: a marginal difference.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, at page 1233 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, page 216]</BOLD>; Report of Maryse Larouche dated February 5, 2016, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1182 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 61, page 564].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>41. The major difference between the two experts was an unsubstantiated 20% to 30% reduction by Mr. Principe on the theory that in a negotiated settlement, an accident benefits insurer would require this level of discount to settle a claim on a lump sum basis. With respect, this consideration is irrelevant in determining a present value figure for the outstanding health care expenses.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Affidavit of Gary Principe sworn January 29, 2006, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1215 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 44, page 302, at para.5].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>42. The net result of the calculations was that the available accident benefits for health care expenses was either $749,037 (the Plaintiffs' number) or $760,511 to $813,748 (the Defendants' numbers).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Maryse Larouche dated February 5, 2016, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1182 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 61, page 564]</BOLD>; Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1233 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, page 216].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>43. There was no dispute that Barbara Carroll was entitled to these accident benefits for future health care expenses.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER>Costs</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK4><N>a)</N><TI><UNDER>Background</UNDER></TI>
<P>44. In exercising his discretion to substantially reduce the partial indemnity costs requested by the Plaintiffs, the trial Judge relied on three main factors: the conduct of t he Plaintiffs' solicitors in trying to trick the Defendants with respect to the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;; conduct of the Plaintiffs' solicitors that unnecessarily extended the trial; and the modest results obtained at the trial.</P>
<P>45. The trial Judge received and reviewed affidavit and actuarial evidence regarding the present value of the remaining health care expenses, all of which demonstrated that the Plaintiffs achieved little, if any, benefit by proceeding with the trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, page 31, at para.45]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>b)</N><TI><UNDER>The Trick</UNDER></TI>
<P>46. A unique aspect of this case is the attempt by the Plaintiffs' solicitors to enforce their acceptance of the joint offer from the Defendants for $2,150,000 inclusive of interest and costs <UNDER>with no assignment of any remaining benefits for health care expenses</UNDER> after immediately issuing a $2 million bad faith claim against Aviva.</P>
<P>47. Without any risk of proceeding to trial, the value of the Defendants' offer using either the Plaintiffs' valuation of the accident benefits or the higher number of the Defendants' valuation of the accident benefits ranged from $2,899,037 to $2,963,748. The amount recovered in the jury verdict was less than these amounts.</P>
<P>48. The Plaintiffs accepted the $2,150,000 offer without disclosing that they had issued a new Statement of Claim against Aviva claiming $2,000,000 for bad faith, exemplary and punitive damages in connection with the handling of Ms. Carroll's claim. Literally, one minute after accepting the Defendants' offer, the Plaintiffs served the new Statement of Claim. The trial Judge made a finding of fact, based upon the evidence, that the solicitors for the Plaintiffs knew or should have known that the Offer the Plaintiffs' solicitors accepted was intended to settle all claims against the Defendants.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 28, paras.34 and 36].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>49. There was ample evidence for the trial Judge to make this finding. There was nothing in the correspondence that went back and forth between the parties indicating that a bad faith claim would be brought in the event of a settlement.</P>
<P>50. Plaintiffs' counsel attempted to rely upon the words &ldquo;in the proceeding&rdquo; in the Defendants' offer to mean that the settlement would not have encompassed a claim against the Respondent, Aviva, for bad faith and punitive damages.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Offer to Settle of the Defendants September 11, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 2, page 530 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 36, page 177]</BOLD>; Factum of the Appellants, paras. 21, 22 and 23; Affidavit of Robert Sutherland dated September 12, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1 pages 265 and 266 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 9, pages 26 and 27]</BOLD>; Affidavit of Jonathan L.

<P>51. It was clear from the record that, based upon representations made in the continuously aggressive correspondence of the Plaintiffs' solicitors, any threatened bad faith claim would only be brought after the <UNDER>trial</UNDER> of the Action.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Ms. Quigley to Ms. Neate and email chain dated September 6, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, pages 165 to 166 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 11, page 32].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. Other correspondence from the Plaintiffs' solicitors implied that a bad faith claim would be brought in the event that the parties did not reach a reasonable settlement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email of Joseph Obagi dated September 7, 2015. Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, page 180 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 47, page 314].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>53. At least one of the previous offers made by the solicitors for the Plaintiffs to the Defendants contemplated paying a sum of money &ldquo;for all damages and pre -judgement interest&rdquo; without limiting the offer to claims made &ldquo;in this proceeding&rdquo;. In other words, the Plaintiffs' offer contained the same &ldquo;defect&rdquo; as the Defendants' offer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Offer to Settle of the Plaintiffs dated September 9, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, page 191 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 31, page 167].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>54. In an email dated September 10, 2015, the Plaintiffs negotiated separately with Aviva and made no mention of the possibility of a bad faith claim against Aviva should the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, including Aviva, reach a settlement.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Ms. Quigley to Ms. Neate and Mr. Sutherland dated September 10, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, page 201 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 12, page 33]</BOLD>; Email from Ms. Quigley to Ms. Neate and Mr. Sutherland dated September 10, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, page 211 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 13, page 34].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>55. In a letter dated September 11, 2015, the solicitors for the Plaintiffs made a further attempt to negotiate separately with Aviva and continue the action against the McEwens, again with no reference to an imminent bad faith claim to be issued that very day against Aviva.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from Ms. Quigley to Robert Sutherland and Stephanie Neate dated September 11, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, pages 222 and 223 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 14, pages 35 and 36].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>56. Having had the bad faith claims sprung on them, the Release that the Defendants required included a specific reference to any bad faith claims against Aviva. The Defendants' concern regarding the scope of the release has been proven by subsequent facts. On August 25, 2017, two weeks before the initial hearing of this appeal, the Appellants issued a further Statement of Claim for damages for breach of the duty of good faith in their capacity as assignees of the Trustee in Bankruptcy of the McEwens.</P>
<P>57. Having abandoned the appeal with respect to the Carrolls' ability to make a claim in the McEwens' bankruptcy, the Plaintiffs are attempting to do indirectly what they could not do directly by advancing a claim as the assignees of the McEwens against the McEwens' insurer.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Statement of Claim in action no.

<P>58. The Appellants maintain that the release would have required the Plaintiffs to release an y claims for past accident benefits which had been incurred and not paid. This is not correct. There was no evidence in the record of any dispute with respect to expenses that had been incurred but not paid. Subsequent evidence demonstrates that as of September 15, 2015, the accident benefits for health care expenses incurred prior to the scheduled start date for the trial continued to be paid.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Report of Gary Principe dated December 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1233 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 43, page 217].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>c)</N><TI><UNDER>The Plaintiffs' motion to enforce the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;</UNDER></TI>
<P>59. The settlement fell apart with the service of the new Statement of Claim. The Plaintiffs brought a motion to enforce the settlement. Affidavits were exchanged and the matter was heard by Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015. The Plaintiffs ultimately withdrew their motion when it became clear that Justice Hackland was not going to enforce the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;. The trial Judge, in his decision on costs, referred to the Plaintiffs' conduct in relation to the settlement as &ldquo;essentially a trick&rdquo; (see para.49 of the Reasons).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of Justice McLean <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, page 32, at para.49]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>60. Justice Hackland indicated that it would have been &ldquo;so easy&rdquo; for Plaintiffs' counsel, when they accepted the Offer, to have indicated that the acceptance was without prejudice to the Plaintiffs' right to pursue a bad faith claim and then everything would have been &ldquo;on the table for both sides to know&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 49, line 17 to page 50, line 4].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>61. Justice Hackland also indicated that he was not going to enforce any settlement and if there was going to be a settlement, a release that corresponds with the reasonable expectations of the parties would be part of the package.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 51, line 32 to page 52, line 4].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Justice McLean also concluded, on the facts, that the parties did or should have understood that the offer was made on the basis that it would deal with everything outstanding, including a bad faith claim.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the Trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 28 and 30]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>62. This Court has implicitly endorsed the views and expectations of Justice Hackland and Justice McLean, particularly with respect to Releases against an insurer, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Furthermore, the reference in the Release to claims for &ldquo;aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages or damages for alleged bad faith&rdquo; is standard language in any form of release. Indeed, the paragraph goes on to explain that the Release covers such claims for damages &ldquo;whether these claims are past, present or future, <UNDER>and whether these claims are known or unknown at the present time</UNDER>&rdquo;. (emphasis added)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 717</CITE></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Revised Plaintiffs' Book of Authorities, Tab 7, para.37].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>63. Justice Hackland also indicated that no one would seriously suggest that the Defendants' offer would be accepted and the amount of the settlement be paid, only to be faced with instalment litigation on the bad faith issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 82, lines 9 to 22].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>64. Justice Hackland was clearly troubled by what the Plaintiffs' solicitors had done. Justice Hackland referred to the tactics and arguments of the Plaintiffs' counsel as &ldquo;a little elaborate&rdquo;. Justice McLean made a more direct finding. He called it a trick.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 72, lines 5 and 6]</BOLD>; Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, para.49, page 32].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>65. Justice Hackland indicated that it would be, in his opinion, &ldquo;so much better&rdquo; if the settlement went ahead as is, with a general release that would include the bad faith claim. The Appellants chose not to follow Justice Hackland's suggestion.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 82, lines 24 to 29].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>66. Justice Hackland offered the Plaintiffs the opportunity to withdraw their motion, which they did, leaving the entire merits of the Plaintiffs' attempt to litigate in instalments to the trial Judge.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 93, lines 22 to 29, page 94, lines 5 to 9, page 88, lines 17 to 19].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>67. The record of the proceedings before Justice Hackland was sealed until after the jury verdict was received. The trial Judge reviewed the complete record and there should be no suggestion that he was misled (see para.29 of the Revised Plaintiffs' Factum). The trial Judge made the following findings of fact:
<QUOTE><P>... all parties did or should have understood that that Offer was made on the basis that it would deal with everything outstanding, including a mala fide claim, (at para.36 of the Reasons)</P>
<P>... the Plaintiffs were clearly aware of what they were doing and that they were in fact taking the Defendants by surprise ... Clearly when one looks at the nature of the various offers that were made, it is without question that the situation before all parties was that the offers were made on the basis of settlement of all matters. (para.37)</P>
<P>Clearly the Court is interested in making sure that <EM>bona fide</EM> offers are treated in a <EM>bona fide</EM> manner. It helps little that a <EM>bona fide</EM> offer is made and that a party who knows or ought to know that the basis of that offer is the settlement of all issues then turns around and without notice to all parties begins another proceeding. This is not something that this Court can countenance without sanction. If such behavior was not sanctioned, then it would in this Court's view cause great difficulty with regard to obtaining settlements themselves. (para.48)</P>
<P>It is ... very concerning that ... an attempt would be made to enforce what was essentially anon-enforceable offer. Its unenforceability was caused by the fact that the party who accepted the offer intended to change the rules of the game immediately after the offer's acceptance. This was essentially a trick, (para 49)<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 28 and 32].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>d)</N><TI><UNDER>The Plaintiffs needlessly extended the trial</UNDER></TI>
<P>68. The second factor on which the trial Judge relied to reduce the costs claimed by the Plaintiffs was that the Plaintiffs' solicitors failure to comply with a case management order and in this and other ways needlessly extended the trial. He held that &ldquo;the behaviour of the Plaintiffs did extend the proceedings&rdquo;, for example by requiring discovery in the middle of the trial and by giving &ldquo;lip service&rdquo; to the Order of the Case Management Master, (paras. 45 and 47). These conclusions are amply supported by the record.</P>
<BLOCK5><N>(i)</N><TI><UNDER>The Case Management Order</UNDER></TI>
<P>69. Counsel for the Plaintiffs ignored the Case Management Order of Master McLeod, as he then was, dated May 26, 2014. They failed to serve any of the expert reports relied upon at trial 90 days in advance of the pre-trial, as required by the Case Management Order. The trial was set for September 8, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Case Management Order of Master McLeod dated May 26, 2014, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, pages 729-730 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 6, pages 38 and 39].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This put the Defendants in the position of doing their best to obtain responding reports as soon as they could.</P>
<P>70. The Plaintiffs served a liability report less than eight days before the pre-trial held on June 17, 2015. The Defendants were only able to obtain a responding report by July 29, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Submission of the Plaintiffs' judgement and costs, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 849 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 57, page 541].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK5>
<BLOCK5><N>(ii)</N><TI><UNDER>The Plaintiffs' change of position on the cost of future care</UNDER></TI>
<P>71. The cost of future care was obviously one of the main issues in this case. Until a few months before trial, the Plaintiffs maintained that there had been no change in Ms. Carroll's condition as it related to future care requirements. However, three weeks before the trial was scheduled to commence, this position changed and the Plaintiffs advanced a much more expensive option. The Plaintiffs advanced a different theory for Ms. Carroll's cost of future care.</P>
<P>72. When the Respondent McEwens asked about the status of the Plaintiffs' cost of future care report in correspondence dated May 29, 2015, (approximately 3 months before trial) Plaintiffs' counsel advised that &ldquo;... I do not believe that her needs have changed substantially. We do not expect that we will be bearing the expense of updating the report until after the pre-trial&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Nearing dated May 29, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 736 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 60, page 556]</BOLD>; Letter from Mr. Nearing to Ms. Quigley dated May 27, 2015, re readiness for pre-trial and trial, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 731 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 20, pages 125, 126].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>73. In a letter dated June 9, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel maintained its opposition to the Defendants' future care expert conducting an assessment and clearly indicated that the future care report being relied upon was an October 2012 report by Ms. Laura Feldt. As a result, the Defendants were only able to obtain their cost of future care report by August 17, 2015.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Nearing and Mr. Sutherland dated June 9, 2015; Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 738 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 21, page 130]</BOLD>; Preliminary future care needs and costs analysis report by Ms. Laura Feldt dated October 24, 2012, Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1061 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 22, page 131].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. The very next day, three weeks before trial, the Plaintiffs served their revised cost of future care report by Carol Bierbrier dated August 18, 2015. As the Court heard from the evidence, the August 18, 2015 report by Ms. Bierbrier was not simply an update regarding Barbara Carroll's future care needs, nor was it simply a rebuttal of the Defendants' cost of future care report. It was a departure from what could be considered an update and it advanced various options, including a new and more expensive approach to Barbara Carroll's future care.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Letter serving Carol Bierbrier report dated August 18, 2015 Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 742 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 23, page 132]</BOLD>; Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, page 29, at para.41].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>75. The evidence at trial of Ms. Bierbrier confirmed that counsel's representation that there had been no substantial change in Barbara Carroll's needs was incorrect. Ms. Bierbrier testified that there had been an improvement over the last number of years (i.e. since the October 2012 report) and that maybe now the time was right to proceed with intensive treatment that had not been recommended in earlier reports.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Trial transcripts (Carol Bierbrier) September 30, 2015, page 88, lines 7 to 25 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 19, page 130]</BOLD>; Trial transcripts (Carol Bierbrier) October 1, 2015, page 15, line 17 to page 16, line 3 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 20, pages 132 and 133].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> According to Ms. Bierbrier, the improvements in Ms. Carroll's function had occurred over time and not just after Plaintiffs' counsel letter dated May 29, 2015.</P>

<P>77. Plaintiffs' counsel failed to mention that one of the &ldquo;various options provided&rdquo; in the new report and advanced at trial was a much more expensive option. The new report suggested as an option that Ms. Carroll move into an apartment in the retirement facility wing of her residence with a 24-hour a day/7-days a week attendant care at a cost of $130,000 a year.</P>
<P>78. This new option increased the total annual recurring costs for personal care services from $136,733.26 to $195,100.00. This increased the total annual recurring costs to approximately $276,652.85, making it the most expensive cost of future care scenario presented by the Plaintiffs to the jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Future care summary report for tort October 24, 2012 (Affidavit of Maryse Larouche, November 30, 2015), Exhibit Book, Vol. 4, page 1143 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 58, page 554]</BOLD>; Future care summary report for tort August 18, 2015 (Affidavit of Maryse Larouche, November 30, 2015) <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 59, page 555].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>85.

<P>88. Rather than take the offer, they took the risk of proceeding to trial. The three significant &ldquo;trial risks&rdquo; were liability, the Defendants' motion for an assignment and the trial Judge's exercise of his discretion with respect to costs. All three issues went badly for the Plaintiffs.</P>

<P>92. The Plaintiffs have not been able to point to any health care expense addressed in the evidence adduced at trial that does not meet the definition of health care contained in the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>.</P>
<P>93. Section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> sets out the law with respect to collateral benefits. Section 267.8(9) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> contains clear mandatory wording that require a plaintiff to hold amounts received after the trial of the action for statutory accident benefits in trust.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Section 267.8(9) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c.I-8 at Respondent McEwens' Factum, Schedule B, page 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>94. The applicable provision in issue at the trial of this action and on this appeal is section 267.8(12) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> which provides as follows, with respect to the assignment of future collateral benefits:
<QUOTE><SSEC><N>(12)</N><SSECP>The court that heard and determined the action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of the automobile, on motion, may order that, subject to any conditions the court considers just,

<P>95.

<P>96. The provisions require the judgment to be paid in order to get the assignment. This protects claimants from any shortfall in recovery. In other words, there is no risk that a plaintiff will receive less than what was awarded at the trial. The Defendants have repeatedly acknowledged that if they get the assignment, they are prepared to pay the judgment in full.</P>
<P>97. The Appellants have refused to agree to the assignment. Their preferred approach appears to be that the judgment has to be paid in full before the motion for an assignment can be argued. This is impractical. The proper approach is to address the assignment issue with the trial Judge, at the conclusion of the trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v.

<P>105. This case involves none of the debate about matching past and future accident benefits with an award at trial for past and future damages. In this case, the damages claimed and the accident benefits for health care expenses are all with respect to future care claims.</P>
<P>106. On the facts of this case, there is no tort claim for past health care expenses so there is nothing from which to make deductions. There is nothing unfair about the trial Judge's granting the assignment. The Plaintiff receives full compensation without double recovery.</P>
<P>107. Neither does this case present a difficulty with respect to any time limit on the availability of the benefits. The benefits are available for the remainder of Barbara Carroll's life.

<P>110. In <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, this Court reviewed how the relevant provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> have evolved. This evolution and, in particular, the provisions of section 267. 8(9) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; provision) and (12) (the &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; provision) have achieved a rational balancing of the two competing principles of avoiding double recovery and avoiding under-compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v.

<P>111. Past provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> arguably exposed a claimant to a risk of under-compensation. Section 239(2) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, provided for a general release &ldquo;... to the extent of payments made or available to the claimant ...&rdquo; without specifying the nature of the payment, whether it be for past or future income, past or future care, and so on.

<P>113. Provisions were arguably even &ldquo;harsher&rdquo; for a claimant under section 267(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1990, in that, it mandated that the damage award be reduced by the present value of &ldquo;any no fault benefits to which the person is entitled&rdquo;; again, without concern as to which particular benefits were being used to reduce the damage award.

<P>114. However strict the &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;oranges to oranges&rdquo; matching requirement was applied by the Court in <EM>Bannon</EM>, the more recent amendments to the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> have done away with the policy rationale for whatever strict matching requirements were previously required by the Courts.

<P>119. The assignment granted by the trial Judge and the assignment in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> were both conditional upon the judgment being paid in full. Pending the resolution of this Appeal, the Respondents have paid the Appellants $2,000,000. If this court upholds the assignment granted by the trial Judge, there is absolutely no risk that the Appellants will not receive full compensation.

<P>125. The trial Judge started his reasons with the following comment:

This is such a case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4 at page 17].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>126. The trial Judge found that, on the facts, it was without doubt that the Defendants' offers, including the all-inclusive offer of $2,150,000 dated September 11, 2015 were made on the basis that everything would be settled between the parties and any settlement would end all litigation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4 at page 28].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>127. The trial Judge presided over this trial for 8 weeks and was in the best position to appreciate the dynamics of the trial. He was satisfied that the Plaintiffs were, in fact, by accepting the offer and immediately serving the $2,000,000 Statement of Claim for bad faith, taking the Defendants by surprise. The trial Judge described the Plaintiffs' tactics as &ldquo;a trick&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4 at page 28].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>128. The trial Judge correctly held that the actions of the Plaintiffs was something the Court &ldquo;cannot countenance without sanction&rdquo;. The Court recognized the unnecessary complexity that the Plaintiffs' actions would inject into settlement negotiations.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 1 at page 32]</BOLD>; Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 16, page 100, lines 5 and 6].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>129. One can only imagine what would have happened had the Defendants accepted the Plaintiffs' offer dated September 9, 2015, which offered to settle &ldquo;all damages and pre&mdash;judgment interest&rdquo; and a specific figure for fees and disbursements without reference to the words &ldquo;in this proceeding&rdquo; and followed it up with a new Statement of Claim for bad faith. Would the Defendants have been able to insist on a release that included bad faith claims, or would the Plaintiffs' have argued that acceptance of the offer only applied to the existing litigation? The mischief caused by the Plaintiffs' actions and the uncertainty &bull; it would bring to settlement negotiations is obvious.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Offer to Settle of Plaintiffs dated September 9, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 1, page 191 and 192 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 31, pages 167 and 168].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>130. Justice Hackland and Justice McLean were both of the view that the reasonable (objective) expectations of counsel were that accepting a $2.15 million offer to settle with no assignment of accident benefits of approximately $900,000 would have ended any and all disputes between the parties.</P>
<P>131. With respect, the Appellants' submissions attempt to turn this issue on its head. The Defendants' expectation of a standard full and final release, including any and all other claims, was, as suggested by Justice Hackland and held by Justice McLean, a reasonable expectation.</P>
<P>132. The &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; caused, on the facts of this case, was the attempt by the Appellants' counsel to rely on a technical argument, i.e. a literal interpretation of the words &ldquo;in this proceeding&rdquo;, to force the Defendants into a settlement for $2,150,000 and one minute later, issuing a $2,000,000 claim for damages for bad faith and punitive damages.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 6, Tab 223 at page 1892, line 32 to page 1893, line 4, page 1923, lines 9 to 22, <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 51, line 32 to page 52, line 4].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>

<P>134. Failure to comply with a case management order has been held to be grounds for depriving a party of costs. In <EM>Saleh</EM>, Justice F.L. Meyers said the following with respect to breaching a trial management order:
<QUOTE><P>The civil justice system in Ontario is broken.

<P>&ellipsis;</P>
<P>In this case, Justice Stinson assisted the parties to ready this matter for trial. At a pre-trial conference on December 3, 2014, he made a comprehensive trial management order. He ordered two of the Plaintiffs treating physicians to provide copies of their up-to-date treatment records. Counsels were required to review their list of proposed witnesses to confirm that the trial could be completed in the available ten day window behind which a new trial date would have been required.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Saleh v.

<P>135. Barbara Carroll's solicitors knowingly and willingly breached Master McLeod's order dated May 26, 2014. They consciously did not obtain an updated cost of a future care report in advance of the pre-trial and instead represented to the Defendants that not much had changed with respect to Barbara Carroll's care. Their own expert testified that this was not the case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Case Management Order of Master McLeod dated May 26, 2014, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, pages 729 - 730 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 6, pages 38 and 39]</BOLD>; Letter serving Carol Bierbrier report dated August 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 742 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 23, page 132]</BOLD>; Letter from Ms. Quigley to Mr. Nearing dated May 29, 2015, Exhibit Book, Vol. 3, page 736 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 60, page 556]</BOLD>; Trial transcripts (Carol Bierbrier) September 30, 2015, page 88, lines 7 to 25 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 19, page 130].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>136. The trial Judge had the benefit of hearing all of the evidence. He correctly identified that the new cost of future care report served on August 18, 2015, was not an update, but a new plan that contemplated more vigorous therapy.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge at paras.41 and 43 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 29 and 30].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>d)</N><TI><UNDER>The trial Judge correctly identified that the Plaintiffs achieved little, if any, benefit by proceeding to trial</UNDER></TI>
<P>137. Justice McLean accurately concluded that not only was virtually all the money available put forward by the Defendants, there was no prospect of the Plaintiffs doing much better than the terms of the September 11, 2015 Joint Offer to Settle for $2,150,000 with no assignment of the outstanding accident benefits for health care expenses. The Plaintiffs were aware of the risk that the Defendants would seek an assignment of the health care expenses at the conclusion of the trial.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the trial Judge at paras.8, 27, 45 <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, pages 21, 27 and 45].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Plaintiffs were also aware of the risk with respect to the liability issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Transcript of hearing before Justice Hackland on September 15, 2015, <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 15, page 70, lines 27 to 32].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>138. A review of the complete record demonstrates that the most contentious issue in the ultimately unsuccessful settlement discussions was the Plaintiffs' costs. The Plaintiffs risked the sure thing of a settlement offer worth in excess, by anyone's calculations, of $2.8 million all inclusive. Instead, they are left with a jury verdict of $2.6 million, less the value of the assignment of health care expenses valued somewhere between $750,000 and $830,000.</P>
<P>139. The net benefit to the Plaintiffs of the verdict, once the assignment of accident benefits of between $750,000 and $830,000 is taken into account, ranges from $1,770,000 to $1,850,000, depending upon the present value figure placed upon the accident benefits for health care expenses. These figures are well below the value of the Defendants' offer of $2,150,000 with no assignment for health care expenses.</P>
<P>140. At the end of the day, the only thing left for the Plaintiffs to recover over and above the offer to settle was costs. As indicated previously, $2,000,000 plus costs was the Defendants' total exposure. The Plaintiffs had 2 choices: accept $2,150,000 with no assignment and no risk, or go to trial and face the risks of the liability issue and the request for an assignment.</P>
<P>141. In the result, regardless of which valuation is accepted regarding the present value of the future accident benefits, the Plaintiffs did worse than the $2.15 million offer to settle.</P>
<P>142. The Plaintiffs decided to go through an 8-week trial in which they had very little to gain and much to lose. An award of $375,000 in costs easily meets the proportionality principle expressed by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Elbakhiet v. Palmer</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Elbakhiet v.

<P>143. In the face of all this, the trial judge made no reviewable error in applying a significant reduction of the Plaintiffs' cost demands of $795,000.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. Pursuant to the case management direction of Justice MacFarland, the Respondents, Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company (hereinafter, &ldquo;these Respondents&rdquo;), submit the within supplementary responding factum, to be read together with all previously filed facta, for the consideration of the five-member panel hearing the within appeal.</P>
<P>2. Specifically, these Respondents address herein the manner in which future collateral benefits are to be handled at trial pursuant to the assignment mechanism set out in the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> (hereinafter, &ldquo;the <EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;), in light of this Court's decisions in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South and El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC><CITE>[2015] O.J No. 5573</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont.C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 5; <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab. 9.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. For the purposes of the within appeal, the dichotomy between <EM>Gilbert</EM> and <EM>El-Khodr</EM> is of no moment because, on the facts, the approach set out in both authorities is met.</P>
<P>4. However, given the position taken in the plaintiff appellants' filed factum, and these Respondents' understanding that the panel is convening to address the state of the law generally with respect to the deduction and trust / assignment mechanisms set out in the <EM>Act</EM>, these Respondents submit that <EM>El-Khodr</EM> is the proper approach in the current legislative scheme.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>The Policy Rationale Requiring Strict Matching Is No Longer Applicable</UNDER></TI>
<P>5. The present flux in the law with respect to the assignment of future collateral benefits arises from conflating two different iterations of the <EM>Act</EM> governing automobile insurance regimes and an unfounded risk of under compensation to a plaintiff where an assignment is granted</P>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>i.</EM></N><TI><EM>Overview of Deduction of Collateral Benefits</EM></TI>
<P>6. From June 22, 1990 onwards, s.231b (now s.267(1)) of the <EM>Act</EM> eliminated the collateral source rule in automobile cases to allow the deduction of collateral sources in the awarding of damages for personal injuries arising from automobile accidents (hereinafter, the &ldquo;OMPP regime&rdquo;).<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.1 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. In the OMPP regime, no specific matching was legislatively mandated between the collateral benefit to be deducted and the head of damage awarded. There was no trust or assignment mechanism available to deal with future benefits which were simply to be present valued and deducted in appropriate circumstances. This led to an understandable concern about deducting the present value of future benefits that the plaintiff may never receive. It was under these circumstances, where the plaintiff bore the risk of undercompensation, that the trilogy of cases, <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. Mc.Neely, Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Cugliari v. White</SOC></CASEREF>, was rendered.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. Mc.Neely</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 4486</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 1 at p.29 citing <CASEREF><SOC>Jang v.

<P>8. In <EM>Bannon</EM>, the Court relied on the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <CASEREF><SOC>Jang v. Jang</SOC></CASEREF> and required accident benefits to be deducted from a head of damage akin to that for which the benefits were intended to compensate. With respect to future benefits, their present value was to be deducted only when entitlement was &ldquo;beyond dispute&rdquo; and a plaintiff qualified in &ldquo;every aspect&rdquo; for the future payments.</P>
<P>9. In <EM>Chrappa</EM>, also set in the OMPP scheme, it was found that where the required certainty of future benefits was not demonstrated, the problem of potential double recovery was resolved by imposing trust/assignment obligations on the plaintiff.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC><CITE>[1998] O.J. No. 1678</CITE><COURTJUR>Ont. C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> affirming <CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC><CITE>[1996] O.J. No. 1667</CITE><COURTJUR>Gen. Div.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at pg. 3, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tabs 1 &amp; 2</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. In 1996, the Legislature amended the <EM>Act</EM> (hereinafter, &ldquo;the Bill 59/198 regime&rdquo;) for accidents occurring from November 1, 1996 onwards and codified the deduction matching principles developed in the <EM>Bannon</EM> trilogy. For example, s.267.8(4) of the <EM>Act</EM> created a matching &ldquo;silo&rdquo; which required that benefits for health care expenses be deducted from damages for health care expenses. There was, and is, no other subject or temporal matching required by statute.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.8(1), (4) &amp; (6) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. Since the legislative amendments, case law eventually and appropriately settled on an easing of the strict subject / temporal matching requirement where collateral benefits are to be deducted.</P>
<P>12. In <CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC></CASEREF>, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that specific matching between the benefit received under the BC accident benefits scheme and the tort damages award was not required beyond the broad &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; stipulated in the BC statute in order to effect an appropriate deduction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Shortly thereafter, this Court came to a similar conclusion in <CASEREF><SOC>Cummings v. Douglas</SOC></CASEREF> where all benefits received by the plaintiff for past and future income losses were to be deducted from the global (past and future) award for loss of income.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cummings (Litigation, Guardian of) v.

<P>14. Subsequent cases, including at the appellate level, have followed this approach. In <CASEREF><SOC>Mikolic v. Tanguay</SOC></CASEREF>, similarly no strict <UNDER>qualitative</UNDER> matching was required. Instead, the Divisional Court properly deducted accident benefits received for past and future attendant care and medical/rehabilitation benefits from the award for future care costs, resulting in a nil award.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Mikolic v Tanguay</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 8196</CITE><COURTJUR>Div.Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras. 44&ndash;47, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 5; <CASEREF><SOC>Foniciello v.

<P>15. This Court affirmed the more relaxed matching approach in the decision of <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF> where benefits received for medical/rehabilitation, attendant care and housekeeping (approximately $146,000) were deducted from the jury award of $105,000 for past and future care, medical/rehabilitation and housekeeping, resulting in a nil award.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 251</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. The correctness of this relaxed matching approach was most recently reiterated by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC></CASEREF>:
<QUOTE><P>[55] For these reasons, s. 267.8(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> requires deduction of all income replacement SABs, and all payments in settlement of claims for income replacement SABs, that the plaintiff receives before trial from the total of all damages awarded at trial for past and future income loss arising from the same incident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v.

<BLOCK3><N><EM>ii.</EM></N><TI><EM>Overview of Assignment of Collateral Benefits</EM></TI>
<P>17. The Bill 59/198 regime also introduced trust and assignment provisions in s.267.8(9) through (12) of the <EM>Act</EM>, setting out the same matching categories or &ldquo;silos&rdquo; for an assignment as those required for a deduction.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Namely, income loss; expenses for health care and other pecuniary losses, section 267.8 (9)&ndash;(12), <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, at Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg.16</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. In statutorily codifying the trust/assignment approach developed in <CASEREF><SOC>Cox v. Carter</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cox v. Carter</SOC><YEAR>1976</YEAR><CITE>13 O.R., (2d) 717</CITE><COURTJUR>H.C.J.</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary, Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, and provided as the &ldquo;solution&rdquo; in <EM>Chrappa</EM>, the Legislature shifted the risk of future entitlement (or non-payment) from plaintiff to defendant. If the plaintiff does not receive any collateral benefit payments after trial, the defendant simply does not receive an offset (or repayment) of damages already paid to the plaintiff.</P>
<P>19. The <EM>Act</EM>, now a complete statutory code, strikes an equitable balance between the risk of undercompensation to a plaintiff and the unfairness of double recovery to a defendant.</P>
<P>20. Nevertheless, two decades after <EM>Bannon</EM> and in the context of a materially different legislative scheme, this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> again considered the <EM>risk</EM> of undercompensation to a plaintiff where an assignment was sought by the defendant. The strict matching approach in <EM>Bannon</EM> and <EM>Chrappa</EM> was followed, despite those decisions arising from the OMPP regime and despite the amendments to the <EM>Act</EM> in the interim, namely the codification of matching &ldquo;silos&rdquo; from <EM>Bannon</EM> and the imposition of trust/assignment provisions as it relates to future benefits from <CASEREF><SOC>Cox v. Carter</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC></CASEREF>.</P>
<P>21. The matching approach followed by this Court in <EM>Cummings</EM> was not considered in <EM>Gilbert</EM>. The approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Gurniak</EM>, which overruled the <EM>Jang</EM> strict matching approach followed in <EM>Bannon</EM>, was also not considered.</P>
<P>22. The finding in <EM>Chrappa</EM>, that where the required certainty of future benefits was not demonstrated, the problem of potential double recovery was resolved by imposing trust/assignment obligations on the plaintiff, was also seemingly overlooked.</P>
<P>23. Strict certainty of entitlement is misplaced where a trust/assignment is concerned, as is a strict matching approach beyond that mandated by statute. In short, <EM>Gilbert</EM> cannot be reconciled with <EM>Gurniak</EM> and erroneously relied on <EM>Bannon</EM>. As such, <EM>Gilbert</EM> is not tenable at law and should be formally overruled. The approach in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> should prevail.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N><EM>iii.</EM></N><TI><EM>The &ldquo;Silos&rdquo; in the Act are Deliberately Broad and Fairly Defined</EM></TI>
<P>24. In Ontario, the <EM>Act</EM> has undergone amendments since the introduction of the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; in the 1996 reforms, yet the breadth of the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; has not changed.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Recent examples include, Bill 213 assented to December 9, 2002; Bill 186 assented to December 13, 2002; Bill 40 assented to June 24, 2004; Bill 18 assented to December 15, 2005; Bill 16 assented to May 18, 2010; Bill 135 assented to December 8, 2010; Bill 173 assented to May 12, 2011; Bill 65 assented to June 13, 2013; Bill 15 assented to November 20, 2014; Bill 91 assented to June 4, 2015; Bill 186 assented to June 9, 2016</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>25. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada, as part of its analysis, relied on the fact that the BC Legislature did not introduce an explicit matching requirement into the statute, when it could readily have done so.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>45</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Similarly, in <CASEREF><SOC>Madill v. Chu</SOC></CASEREF>, the Supreme Court of Canada directed that the degree of matching required should be no more than is required by the plain meaning of the legislation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Madill v. Chu</SOC><CITE>[1977] 2 SCC 400</CITE><PAGENUM>at pgs. 409-410</PAGENUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>26. A strict level of temporal and qualitative matching is not mandated by the <EM>Act</EM>. To find otherwise would theoretically permit a plaintiff avoid an assignment for physiotherapy by seeking out (post-trial) a similar treatment modality, like chiropractic care, or, if after having been awarded damages for Tylenol #3 (with a corresponding qualitatively specific trust/assignment being granted), a plaintiff instead takes Advil. Such an approach promotes the likelihood of double recovery.</P>
<P>27. These Respondents submit that this Court should follow the approach in <EM>Madill</EM> and <EM>Gurniak</EM>, and safeguard the Legislature's intent to prevent double recovery in a manner that is simple, expedient and effective. To require a more strict temporal or qualitative matching than is required by statute is to adopt a scheme which facilitates the potential for double recovery.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>The Plaintiffs' Interpretation of the <EM>Act</EM> Is Flawed</UNDER></TI>
<P>28. The words of the <EM>Act</EM> are to be read in their entire context. It is a well-established principle of statutory interpretation that the Legislature does not intend to produce consequences which would render a statute illogical or incoherent, or which would be incompatible with other provisions or with the object of the legislative enactment.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</SOC><CITE>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 559</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2002 SCC 42</CITE><PAGENUM>at pg. 561</PAGENUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>, Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 9; <CASEREF><SOC>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</SOC><CITE>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27</CITE><PAGENUM>at pg. 43</PAGENUM></CASEREF>, Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities; Tab 10</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>29. The interpretation of the <EM>Act</EM> proposed by the Plaintiffs with respect to s.267.8(l) and (4) of the <EM>Act</EM> is inherently flawed and should not be read so as to limit the deduction of collateral benefits from only those related to the specific damages which the plaintiff received from the jury, and not all losses in that category or &ldquo;silo&rdquo;.</P>
<P>30. The Plaintiffs' approach would essentially allow a plaintiff to decide, at any stage in the proceedings, whether or not to pursue a past loss. If a past loss is not pursued for a period where collateral benefits were received, then a defendant would not be permitted to deduct those collateral benefits pursuant to s.267.8, and the effect of the split and deduct provisions in s.267.8(8) would be undermined. Pursuant to this subsection, collateral benefit deductions are made <UNDER>after</UNDER> any apportionment for contributory negligence. Those provisions could thus be rendered meaningless at the unilateral instance of a plaintiff.</P>
<P>31. As an example, consider a case where a plaintiff has past healthcare expenses of $500,000, which has been completely paid for by his or her accident benefits insurer. Suppose further that the plaintiff does not advance a <UNDER>past</UNDER> healthcare claim at trial and only pursues a <UNDER>future</UNDER> healthcare claim. If the plaintiff is awarded $1,000,000 in <UNDER>future</UNDER> healthcare damages at trial and is found 75% contributorily negligent, her net award would be $250,000.</P>
<P>32. However, if the plaintiff properly advanced her past healthcare claim at trial, she would be awarded nil for past healthcare ($500,000 - 75% = $125,000 - $500,000 of the healthcare benefits received = nil). There would be $375,000 in healthcare benefits remaining which would need to be deducted from the future healthcare damages awarded at trial. The future amount would be nil ($1,000,000 - 75% for contributory negligence = $250,000 - $375,000 = 0).</P>
<P>33. The plaintiffs' suggested approach of not pursuing tort damages that have been paid for by a collateral source is inconsistent with how collateral benefit deductions are to be handled and would render s.267.8(8) meaningless.</P>
<P>34. A plaintiff should not be permitted to manipulate the collateral benefit scheme in such a way, to the detriment of the tortfeasor. In <EM>Madill</EM>, the plaintiff chose not to apply for collateral benefits which he was otherwise &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to and the Supreme Court deducted them nevertheless. As such, if a plaintiff chooses to not advance certain claims for past losses at trial, the collateral benefits that he or she received still need to be deducted.</P>
<P>35. Furthermore, s. 267.7(1) and (2) of the <EM>Act</EM> (as referenced in s.267.8(3)) sets out how joint and several liability is to be dealt with as between protected and non-protected defendants. The provisions call for an assessment of damages broken into the same &ldquo;silos&rdquo; of income loss, health care and other pecuniary losses, but does not reference only those losses the plaintiff choses to pursue or those not covered by collateral benefits. The Plaintiffs' interpretation of <BOLD><EM>the Act</EM></BOLD> appears inconsistent with this provision.</P>
<P>36. Moreover, the &ldquo;the&rdquo; modifier proposed by the plaintiffs<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Plaintiff's Factum, at para. 57</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> is not consistently applied in the <EM>Act</EM>. It is not seen, for example, in the s.267.8(9)&ndash;(12) trust/assignment provisions which specifically contemplate the assignment of <UNDER>all payments in respect of the incident</UNDER>. In fact, the &ldquo;the&rdquo; modifier appears in s.267.8 (1) and (4) only with respect to a deduction of <UNDER>statutory accident benefits</UNDER>, and not with respect to other collateral benefits received or available, such as a private employment benefits scheme. There is no rationale for the Legislature to intend a different scope of deductibility of SABS than other non-SABS collateral benefits. Such an approach would seem anomalous and would unduly complicate the process.</P>
<P>37. The Plaintiffs ask for all deduction and trust/assignment sections to be interpreted in the same manner so as to require strict temporal and qualitative matching. They submit that that outcome is compelled by the &ldquo;the&rdquo; modifier which was put in place in 1996. The problem, however, is that the &ldquo;the&rdquo; modifier is not present in the deduction of non-SABS collateral benefits, nor is it present in the trust/assignment provisions. As such, it is submitted that the &ldquo;the&rdquo; modifier cannot be the word that compels the interpretation the Plaintiffs seek since the modifier is not present in the trust/assignment context in which the Plaintiffs seek the same interpretation.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="IV"><UNDER>The Error in <EM>Gilbert</EM> Should be Corrected</UNDER></TI>
<P>38. In addition to identifying a legal error, this Court has established a broad contextual approach that &ldquo;weigh[s] the advantages and disadvantages of correcting the error in a previous decision&rdquo; to the question of when it will overrule one of its past decisions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</SOC><CITE>2008 ONCA 703 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>127</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 11; <CASEREF><SOC>Green v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</SOC><CITE>2014 ONCA 90</CITE><PARANUM>15</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities; Tab 12</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>39. It is unnecessary to specifically overrule <EM>Bannon</EM> because it applies to a different regime. Similarly, the law on deductions in the current regime is otherwise well settled.</P>
<P>40. These Respondents submit, however, that the relevant considerations in the trust/assignment context, when taken together, support a ruling that <EM>Gilbert</EM> was wrongly decided and ought to be overruled in favour of the assignment approach outlined in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>.</P>
<P>41. <EM>Gilbert</EM> is a recent decision and so overturning it would not cause a dramatic change to the current regime. To reach an alternative conclusion and find as the Plaintiffs ask that there be strict matching in both the deduction and assignment context, would require this Court to overturn or depart from several appellate cases in the deductibility context, including <EM>Cummings, Mikolic, Bassandra</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM>, and would be contrary to at least the dicta in <EM>Gurniak</EM>.</P>
<P>42. The strict qualitative and temporal matching in <EM>Gilbert</EM> should not be applied to s. 267.8 of the <EM>Act</EM>. The policy rationale is not applicable to the current regime. Although the approach in <EM>Gilbert</EM> is met on the facts herein, going forward, the approach in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> should be preferred.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="V"><UNDER>Conclusion</UNDER></TI>
<P>43. The law dealing with <UNDER>deductions</UNDER> is well settled. The appellate decisions in <EM>Cummings, Mikolic, Basandra</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> required no more than the broad matching categories in the <EM>Act</EM> for qualitative matching for the <UNDER>deduction</UNDER> of collateral benefits.</P>
<P>44. Similarly, an <UNDER>assignment</UNDER> of collateral benefits should only require a matching to the broad, enumerated categories or &ldquo;silos&rdquo; stipulated in the <EM>Act</EM>, given the transfer of risk of future payment from plaintiff to defendant. To find otherwise would result in a scheme which facilitates double recovery for plaintiffs. This would be an inequitable result, unfair to defendants, and contrary to the scheme and object of the <EM>Act</EM>, as well as the intention of the Legislature.</P>

<P>1. The Respondents, Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company (hereinafter, &ldquo;These Respondents&rdquo;) have been directed to provide brief written submissions addressing this Court's recent decisions in <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie and Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC></CASEREF>.

<P>2. There were only two issues raised in the within appeal:
<P1>(i) The assignment of future accident benefits;</P1>
<P1>(ii) Costs.</P1>
<P1><BOLD>These Respondents' Factum, para. 5.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>3. The decisions in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> fully support the position of These Respondents, particularly in the following respects.</P>
<BLOCK2><N>A.</N><TI>Assignment of Future Accident Benefits</TI>
<P>4. <EM>El-Khodr</EM> supports the position of These Respondents in the following respects.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Matching Principles</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>5. In <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, the Court tracks the evolution of the legal principals governing the assignment of accident benefits and confirms that the certainty of entitlement requirements of <CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC></CASEREF> and the strict matching requirements in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF> are no longer strictly applicable to the assignment of SABS' entitlement because the statutory regime has changed.
<P1><BOLD>These Respondents' Factum, para. 7.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, These Respondents' Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 2 at paras. 43&ndash;54 citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC><YEAR>1998</YEAR><CITE>38 O.R. (3d) 651</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>&amp; citing</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC><YEAR>1998</YEAR><CITE>38 O.R. (3d) 659</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF><BOLD>.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>6. The Appellants argued that there should be no assignment of future SABS because the jury's global award for &ldquo;future care costs&rdquo; did not distinguish between rehabilitation expenses, attendant care, and medication and assistive devices. These Respondents argued that the &ldquo;silo&rdquo; of costs awarded by the jury for future care costs fell within the same &ldquo;silo&rdquo; of costs covered by the SABs.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, para. 59.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>These Respondents' Factum, para. 17.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>7. <EM>El-Khodr</EM> makes clear that strict matching is not required. MacFarland J.A. stated at para. 60:
<QUOTE><P>. . . the Court is required only to match statutory benefits that fall squarely into the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; created by s. 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> with the tort heads of damage. Income awards are to be reduced only by SABs payments in respect of income loss and health care awards only by SABs payments in respect of health care expenses. The latter item is, I suggest, deliberately broad enough to cover all manner of expenses that relate to health care and would include medications, physiotherapy, psychology sessions, assistive devices and the like. All manner of other expenses that are covered by SABs and that do not fall under the income category or the health care category fall into the &ldquo;other pecuniary losses&rdquo; category.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><BOLD><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>supra</EM>, These Respondents' Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 2 at para. 60.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. This is precisely the position of each of the Respondents in this appeal. The silo of costs contained in the jury award for &ldquo;future care costs&rdquo; falls within the same silo as the SABs entitlement.
<P1><BOLD>These Respondents' Factum, para. 17.</BOLD></P1>
<P1><BOLD>McEwen Respondents' Factum, paras. 85&ndash;93.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>9. Further, it was correct for the jury to discount the award for future care costs for any medications and assistive devices Barbara Carroll may receive from the Ontario Drug Benefit Program (&ldquo;ODBP&rdquo;), if the jury in fact did so. They jury is obliged to award damages based on the law as it currently exists. Given Barbara Carroll's eligibility under the ODBP at age 65, she would suffer no loss from that age forward because her drug claims would be covered by the ODBP. If the jury did <UNDER>not</UNDER> discount the award for future care costs for ODBP, the end result would be the <UNDER>overcompensation</UNDER> of the Plaintiffs.

<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER><EM>Jury Questions</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>10. In this appeal, and in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, the Appellants argued that the Respondents &ldquo;drafted the damages questions for the jury&rdquo; and must bear the consequences of any resulting uncertainty in the matching of costs. It should be noted that Appellant's counsel in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> is also counsel in the present case. In oral submissions, in response to a question from the Bench, he stated, in effect, that it was not his responsibility to ensure that the jury questions were properly categorized.

<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, paras. 58&ndash;62.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>11. The Respondents' position was that the framing of jury questions was <BOLD>a joint</BOLD> responsibility ultimately to be determined by the trial Judge,</P>
<P>12. Madame Justice MacFarland states at para. 83:
<QUOTE><P>Plaintiff's should not be able to avoid either the deductibility or assignment of SABs already received or to which they will be entitled in future by the manner in which the claim for special damages is presented.</P></QUOTE>
and at para. 85:
<QUOTE><P>Plaintiffs should be required to present their cases in this way. They alone know best what amounts they have expended in relation to their injuries that their SABs insurer did not or will not reimburse.

<P>13. Justice McLean gave several reasons to support his cost decision including the net value of the Judgment compared to the settlement proposals, and &ldquo;the trick&rdquo;.</P>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>Net Recovery</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. Herein, the Appellants achieved a jury verdict of $2.6 million, less the value of the assignment of health care expenses valued in the range of $750,000 to $830,000, resulting in a net benefit to the Appellants in the range of $1,770,000 to $1,850,000.</P>
<P>15. The Appellants' joint offers to settle ranged from $1,856,250 to $1,950,000, plus costs.</P>
<P>16. The Respondents' joint offer to settle dated September 11, 2015 was for $2,150,000 all-inclusive with no assignment of future accident benefits.</P>
<P>17. It was entirely appropriate for Justice McLean to consider, in part, the value of the future accident benefits assigned to the Respondents in concluding that the Appellants' joint offers were less than the verdict's benefit to the Appellants.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><TI><UNDER>&ldquo;The Trick&rdquo;</UNDER></TI>
<P>18. The Appellants argued that the offer to settle dated September 11, 2015, referred only to issues in &ldquo;this proceeding&rdquo; which did not include a potential claim for bad faith.
<P1><BOLD>Appellants' Factum, para. 72.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>19. Justice McLean concluded that the Appellants' counsel would know that the offer included all potential claims against the Respondents. The purported acceptance of the offer to settle, while initiating a separate claim in bad faith, was &ldquo;a trick&rdquo;. This was one of the several reasons given by Justice McLean for the exercise of his discretion on costs.</P>
<P>20. In <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC></CASEREF>, MacFarland, J.A. states at para. 37:
<QUOTE><P>Furthermore, the reference in the Release to claims for &ldquo;aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages or damages for alleged bad faith&rdquo; is standard language in any form of release. Indeed, the paragraph goes on to explain that the Release covers such claims for damages &ldquo;whether these claims are past, present or future and whether these claims are known or unknown at the present time.&rdquo;</P></QUOTE>

<P>21. This supports the Respondents' contention, and Justice McLean's conclusion, that Appellants' counsel must have known that the offer to settle included all claims including any potential claims for bad faith.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The Appellants make the following submissions in respect of <UNDER><EM>El-Khodr</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Cobb</EM></UNDER>:
<P1>(a) the principles set out in <UNDER><EM>Bannon</EM></UNDER>, <UNDER><EM>Gilbert</EM></UNDER> and <UNDER><EM>Fonseca</EM></UNDER> are binding on this Court;</P1>
<P1>(b) <EM>Gilbert</EM> is directly applicable and not distinguishable on its facts in this case;</P1>
<P1>(c) this Court requires a five member panel to reverse these binding authorities; and</P1>
<P1>(d) <EM>El-Khodr</EM> confirmed that the law of deductions of future collateral benefits has been replaced by assignments. Similarly, the Court should similarly <UNDER>not</UNDER> be deducting the present value of collateral benefits from Judgments to assess offers to settle.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;SUBMISSIONS</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><EM>Bannon, Gilbert and Fonseca</EM> are Binding Authorities</TI>
<P>2. The case of <EM>El-Khodr</EM> (as well as <EM>Cobb</EM>) was heard by a three member panel of this Honourable Court. No request for a five member panel was made to the Chief Justice and none of the appellants in those cases argued that <EM>Bannon</EM> was no longer good law nor that <EM>Gilbert</EM> was not binding authority. As a result, <EM>Bannon, Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Fonseca</EM> remain binding authorities.</P>
<P>3. The following principles of law are set out in <EM>Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Fonseca</EM>:
<P1>(a) a defendant seeking an assignment faces a very strict onus of proof that the entitlement to an assignment is &ldquo;beyond dispute.&rdquo; If there is uncertainty, then matters are not &lsquo;beyond dispute&rsquo;; and</P1>
<P1>(b) there is both a temporal and a qualitative matching requirement for assignments.</P1></P>
<P>4. The panel in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> distinguished <EM>Gilbert</EM> on three factual grounds:
<P1>(a) there was no temporal limitation for the <EM>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</EM> (&ldquo;SABS&rdquo;) benefits available to Mr. El Khodr as they were available for his lifetime;</P1>
<P1>(b) there were no benefits for which the assignment was requested that were not covered by the SABS; and</P1>
<P1>(c) there was no lump sum jury award in <EM>Ei-Khodr</EM> which would make it impossible to match SABS to the jury award.</P1></P>
<P>5. None of the above distinguishing factors apply on the facts of this case.</P>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(i)</EM></N><TI><EM>Temporal Limitations</EM></TI>
<P>6. It is common ground between the parties that Barbara Carroll's accident benefits are time limited. She will <UNDER>not</UNDER> be entitled to receive and collect benefits on an ongoing basis for the rest of her life. She had already exhausted a large proportion of the SABS limits prior to trial.</P>
<P>7. It is common ground that Barbara Carroll's attendant care benefits cease in 8.67 years post -trial With respect to her medical and rehabilitation benefits, the Appellant took the position that the benefits cease in 2.55 years post-trial. The Respondents took the position that the benefits ceased in 1.5 years. Benefits will not be available for the rest of Barbara Carroll's life.</P>
<P>8. The parties have no idea what amount the jury awarded to the Plaintiff in attendant care for the 8.67 year period for which Barbara Carroll will continue to be entitled to attendant care benefits nor do we know what the jury awarded in medical and rehabilitation expenses for the 1.5-2.55 year period of time for which Barbara Carroll will continue to be entitled to medical and rehabilitation benefits.</P>
<P>9. As in <EM>Gilbert</EM>, there is a temporal aspect to Barbara Carroll's entitlement to ongoing SABS benefits. No such evidence existed in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>. The evidence here is unequivocal and unchallenged. Barbara Carroll's SABS benefits are time limited.</P>
<P>10. While the jury award covers a period intended to indemnify Barbara Carroll for life, the SABS benefits sought to be assigned will not cover the same period. Effectively, this means that the temporal period of the insurance benefits sought to be assigned do not correspond in any way to the temporal period covered by the jury's award for damages.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(ii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Qualitative Limitations</EM></TI>
<P>11. The actual assignment granted by this Honourable Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> respects that there are qualitative restrictions. The resulting assignment was limited to the specific expenses claimed. The Defendant in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> received an assignment of benefits for &ldquo;future medical and assistive devices&rdquo; which was limited to the amount the jury awarded for that head of damage. The assignment of benefits payable for &ldquo;psychological, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, kinesiology/personal training, case management services and travel to medical or other specialists&rdquo; was also limited to the jury award relating to those damages.</P>
<P>12. In <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, there were also no benefits for which the assignment was requested which were not covered by the SABS. That is not the case here. While there are other examples of claims not covered by the accident benefits insurer (such as financial planning), the best example of this can be found in attendant care. Attendant care is limited to $6,000 per month by the SABS. The Plaintiffs' claim for attendant care ranged from $146,073 to $210,563 annually or $12,172,75 to $17,546.92 monthly.</P>
<P>13. This means that there were <UNDER>significant</UNDER> claims advanced that were not recoverable under the SABS. If the jury accepted the Plaintiffs' claims, there were over $10,000 per month of damages awarded (for attendant care alone) which are not recoverable at all under the <EM>SABS</EM>. Considering the Plaintiff took the position that her attendant care needs continued th roughout her lifetime, it would mean that the bulk of the future care award is not at all recoverable under the SABS yet a full assignment is sought.</P>
<P>14. Assuming the award can be justified entirely based upon attendant care (which is a possibility), the matching principle would be offended if the Defendants were to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; from the SABS medical and rehabilitation payments to compensate themselves for attendant care amounts awarded but not recoverable under the SABS at all. Similarly, if the jury award is based primarily on medical and rehabilitation expenses (the SABS portion of which expire between 1.5 and 2.55 years), there would be significant claims that are awarded by the jury but not recoverable under the SABS which would be assigned.</P>
<P>15. The tort defendant cannot be permitted to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; from another category of benefits to recover for tort damages that the SABS insurer was never responsible to pay.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N><EM>(iii)</EM></N><TI><EM>Lump sum jury award</EM></TI>
<P>16. Unlike in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, the jury award in this appeal is a lump sum global amount for future care which is precisely the award addressed in <EM>Gilbert</EM>. In the within case, it is impossible to match the global award for &ldquo;future care costs&rdquo; to the SABS benefits. The <EM>Gilbert</EM> decision affirms that even though overlap is <UNDER>likely,</UNDER> it does not negate the requirement to match the damages with the future treatment covered under the SABS. Accordingly, the Respondents cannot meet their onus of proof.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>The Need for a Five Member Panel</TI>
<P>17. In the event that this Honourable Court is inclined to entertain the reasons in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> as implicitly overruling <EM>Bannon, Gilbert</EM> and <EM>Fonseca</EM>, the Appellants submit that a five member panel should be convened to determine that issue in accordance with the <UNDER><EM>Practice Direction Concerning Civil Appeals at the Court of Appeal</EM></UNDER>. It would be inappropriate for a three member panel to reverse prior binding decisions.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI>Implications on Costs</TI>
<P>18. <EM>El-Khodr</EM> clarifies that courts are <UNDER>not</UNDER> required to calculate and deduct the present value of collateral benefits to which the plaintiff would be entitled from the damage award. The court should similarly not be <UNDER>deducting</UNDER> collateral benefits from Judgment amounts for comparison with offers to settle. Plaintiffs are never required to accept such a deduction. The risk of non-payment of collateral benefits is squarely upon defendants, not injured plaintiffs. A plaintiff is entitled to the full value of the judgment with <UNDER>no deduction</UNDER>. The current legislation is premised on assignments, not deductions.</P>
<P>19. Even if a deduction for the present value of accident benefits was considered for costs purposes, the Appellants <UNDER>still</UNDER> beat their own offers to settle. Barbara Carroll and family received a Judgment of $2,610,774.32 (plus costs). They offered to settle the action for $1,856,000 (plus costs). The experts disagree on the present value of accident benefits however <UNDER>both</UNDER> experts agree that the Appellants beat their offer <EM>even if the present value of accident benefits were deducted</EM>. The Appellants' expert says they beat their offer by $170,130.00 and the Respondents' expert says the margin was $10,486.00. Barbara Carroll and family also offered to settle as against the McEwen Respondents for $1,000,000 (plus costs). It is admitted that this offer was beaten. Yet this $1M offer was not even mentioned in the costs decision.</P>
<P>20. The attempt to convolute the costs argument by attributing the full present value of accident benefits to the Plaintiffs is wrong in law. Even if it were proper, the result is that the Appellants were acting reasonably while the Defendants tailed to accept offers which were <UNDER>less than</UNDER> the Judgment and <UNDER>less than</UNDER> their insurance limits. The Respondents, not the Appellants, should have been penalized in costs.</P>

<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;<UNDER>OVERVIEW</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. By coincidence, the Respondent, Aviva Canada Inc., is both the liability insurer of the Defendants, Robert McEwen and Caroline McEwen, and the insurer of the Plaintiff, Barbara Lynn Carroll, providing underinsured coverage (OPCF 44 endorsement) through its affiliate, Pilot Insurance Company.</P>
<P>2. The Plaintiffs sued both Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company (hereinafter, &ldquo;These Respondents&rdquo;) for indemnity for any sums which could not be recovered from the defendants, Robert McEwen and Caroline McEwen (hereinafter, &ldquo;McEwen Respondents&rdquo;) pursuant to the underinsured coverage provided by the Plaintiff's policy. These Respondents defended the action brought against them, contesting liability and damages, as was their right.
<P1><BOLD>Statement of Defence of Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company dated December 7, 2011&mdash;Appeal Book and Compendium, Tab 10, p. 65</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>3. The interests of the McEwen Respondents and These Respondents are therefore closely aligned as Defendants (Respondents) in the context of this litigation. As a result, counsel for the McEwans took the lead for the Defendants at the trial, and does so again on this appeal.</P>
<P>4. These Respondents are in substantial agreement with the submissions contained in the Factum of the McEwen Respondents.</P>
<P>5. There are only two grounds of appeal. Each challenges the exercise of the trial Judge's wide discretion with respect to:
<P1>i. The assignment of future accident benefits;</P1>
<P1>ii. Costs.</P1></P>
<P>6. The trial Judge had broad discretion with respect to each of these decisions. After presiding over a lengthy trial he exercised that discretion carefully and based upon the appropriate legal principles.</P>
<P>7. Section 267.8 (12) of the <EM>Insurance Act of Ontario</EM> provides the trial Judge with discretion to order an <UNDER>assignment of future accident benefits</UNDER> in order to prevent double recovery. Here, the trial Judge had the advantage of hearing all of the evidence in a long trial. He then properly concluded that an assignment of future accident benefits was plainly necessary to prevent double recovery by the Plaintiff.
<P1><BOLD>Section 267.8(12) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, RSO 1990, c.1-8 at These Respondents' Factum, Schedule B, p. 11.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>8. The trial Judge exercised his discretion in <UNDER>fixing the costs</UNDER> of the parties at the conclusion of the trial. The outcome for the plaintiff was arguably less favourable than a joint offer to settle made by the defendants. Furthermore, the Judge had ample opportunity to assess the conduct of plaintiff's counsel throughout the long trial and the proceedings leading up to it. The trial Judge had every right to take these factors into account in exercising his discretion to award costs to the Plaintiff of $375,000.00.</P>
<P>9. There is no good reason why leave should be granted to appeal the trial Judge's exercise of discretion in fixing the costs of this case. His award was balanced, based on proper principles, and, in the circumstances, more than fair to the Plaintiffs.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;<UNDER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</UNDER></TI>
<P>10. These Respondents adopt the Statement of Facts set out in the Factum of the McEwen Respondents in paragraphs 11&ndash;77 but add that the OPCF 44 endorsement does not provide compensation for costs. Although the Court does have overriding authority to award costs against an underinsurer in certain circumstances, this is not such a case. Accordingly, the cost award is essentially an issue for the McEwen Respondents to deal with.

<P>11. The trial Judge's decision to order the assignment of future accident benefits is relevant to the cost award and, therefore, is also of direct interest to the McEwen Respondents.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;<UNDER>ISSUES AND ARGUMENT</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. These Respondents accept and adopt the submissions of the McEwen Respondents in paragraphs 78&ndash;114 of their Factum but wish to add the following.</P>

<QUOTE><P>is to ensure that a successful plaintiff in a tort action is not over-compensated by the receipt of collateral benefits&mdash;in other words, to ensure that the plaintiff does not obtain &ldquo;double recovery&rdquo;.</P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM> at para. 43, Appellants Book of Authorities, Tab 2.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>15. It should not matter whether there is &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; of future payments. When the payments stop, the assignment ceases to have any effect. The risk is borne entirely by the Defendants.</P>
<P>16. In the case of an <UNDER>assignment</UNDER> of <UNDER>future benefits</UNDER>, as here, it is not the entitlement which should be &ldquo;beyond dispute&rdquo; but merely that the tort award be &ldquo;akin&rdquo; to the payments which are to be assigned to the Defendants.

<P>17. The relevant &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; referred to in the cases applies here to the nature of the future costs allowed by the jury, as compared to the category of costs to be covered by the assignment. In this case, the future benefits are not only &ldquo;akin&rdquo; to the costs of the jury award, they are identical. In the language of this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF>, each falls under the &ldquo;silo&rdquo; of health care expenses, which includes attendant care and medical rehabilitation costs.
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF><BOLD>, <EM>supra</EM> at para. 21, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 1.</BOLD></P1></P>
<P>18. Here, the Judge identified the correct principles to be applied, considered the extensive evidence placed before the jury, and correctly concluded that an assignment was appropriate to prevent obvious double recovery.</P>
<P>19. The trial Judge determined, based on the extensive evidence given at trial, including affidavit and viva voce evidence concerning the present value of future entitlement, that an assignment was appropriate. His Honour held that:
<QUOTE><P>When we consider all of the evidence at trial, and indeed the further evidence with respect to this matter now placed before the Court, the Court is satisfied within the wording of <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> that a very strict onus of proof has been made out and that based on that evidence it is patently clear that the preconditions for an appropriate assignment have been made out.</P></QUOTE>

<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI>Costs</TI>
<P>21. The trial Judge had a wide discretion to fix the costs at the end of this long trial. It is submitted that the trial Judge clearly considered the proper principles pursuant to Rule 57.01(1) of the <EM>Rules of Civil Procedure</EM>. Moreover, he had the advantage of presiding over the lengthy trial proceedings and properly took the relevant considerations into effect. The exercise of his discretion should be shown deference.

<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>I</N><TI>OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. At the request of the panel that heard the Appeal in this matter on September 14, 2017, the Respondents McEwens make the following submissions with respect to the effect of this Court's Decisions in <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716</CITE></CASEREF>, and <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 717</CITE></CASEREF>, both of which were released on September 19, 2017.</P>
<P>2. Particular emphasis will be placed on the <EM>El-Khodr</EM> decision as it is a decision that dealt directly with the issue of the assignment of benefits for an award for the cost of future care.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716</CITE><PARANUM>24&ndash;80</PARANUM></CASEREF>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>3. In <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, this Court set out, in considerable detail, how the relevant provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> have evolved, as well as how the case law has evolved.</P>
<P>4. This evolution, and in particular, the provisions of section 267.8 (9) (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; provision) and (12) (the &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; provision) have achieved a rational balancing of the two competing principles of avoiding double recovery and avoiding under-compensation.</P>
<P>5. The reasons in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> are completely consistent and on all fours with the Respondents McEwens' submissions with respect to the facts and law in their Factum.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>Factum of the Defendants (Respondents),</BOLD> Robert McEwen and Caroline McEwen, paras. 25&ndash;38 and 78&ndash;93.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>6. The reasons of this Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> are also completely consistent with the Trial Judge's review of the facts and law in his Reasons for Decision.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the Trial Judge, para.3&ndash;12 <BOLD>[Appeal Book and Compendium, Volume 1, Tab 4, at pp.18&ndash;22.]</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<BLOCK3><N>A.</N><TI><UNDER>The Evolution of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM></UNDER></TI>
<P>7. From paragraphs 38&ndash;54, the Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> reviewed past provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> which arguably exposed a claimant to a risk of under-compensation. Section 239(2) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1980 provided for a general release &ldquo;... to the extent of payments made or available to the claimant ...&rdquo; without specifying the nature of the payment, whether it be for past or future income, past or future care and so on.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.38 and 39.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In other words, there was no statutory requirement for matching.</P>
<P>8. As the Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> explained, <EM>&ldquo;Cox and Carter&rdquo;</EM> orders were used to address uncertainties with respect to future benefits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at para.40.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In <CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court upheld the Trial Judge's imposition of a <EM>&ldquo;Cox &amp; Carter&rdquo;</EM> order to avoid the prospect of double recovery.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Chrappa v. Ohm</SOC><YEAR>1998</YEAR><CITE>38 O.R. (3d) 651</CITE><COURTJUR>C.A.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Authorities Brief, Tab 2].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. Provisions were arguably even &ldquo;harsher&rdquo; for a claimant under section 267(1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, R.S.O. 1980 in that it mandated that the damage award be reduced by the present value of &ldquo;any no-fault benefits to which the person is entitled&rdquo;; again, without concern as to which particular benefits were being used to reduce the damage award.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at para.41.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Here again, there was no statutory requirement for matching.</P>
<P>10. As the Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> explained, the result in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. Hagerman Estate</SOC></CASEREF> was necessary to avoid a double accounting of the reduction for no-fault benefits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.52, 53 and 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Further, however strict the &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;oranges and oranges&rdquo; matching requirement was applied by the Court in <EM>Bannon</EM>, the amendments to the legislation have done away with the policy rationale for whatever strict matching requirement was required by the Courts.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, Supra at paras.53 and 54.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>11. With the enactment of section 267.8 and, in particular, sub-sections (8) and (12), the legislation has evolved and directed how the matching is to take place.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>The Current Legislation and &ldquo;Silos&rdquo;</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. Section 267.8, in its current form, was enacted in 1996. This Court, in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Basandra</EM>, recognized that it codifies the common law principle that a plaintiff should not recover twice for the same kind of loss arising from the same accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at para.33, and <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 251</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>130 O.R. (3d) 466</CITE><PARANUM>18</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Authorities Brief, Tab 6].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Consistent with the decision of this Court in <EM>Basandra</EM>, the Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> recognized that there is nothing in the wording of the language of the current legislation that would require any further subdivision of statutory benefits beyond the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; created by section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Basandra</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.4 and 5 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Authorities Brief, Tab 6]</BOLD> and <CASEREF><SOC>Mikolic v. Tanguay</SOC><CITE>2016 ONSC 71</CITE><COURTJUR>Div. Ct.</COURTJUR></CASEREF> at paras.44&ndash;47 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Authorities Brief, Tab 7].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The Trial Judge's decision is consistent with the assignment provisions in section 267.8(12) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Gurniak</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.70 and 71; <CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>[2003] 2 SCR 652</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF> <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Authorities Brief, Tab 1].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>C.</N><TI><UNDER><EM>Gilbert v. South</EM> is Distinguishable from this Case</UNDER></TI>
<P>14. As the Respondents indicated in their Factum, the Trial Judge correctly concluded that, on the record before him, this case satisfied the onus of proof set out by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Reasons for Decision of the Trial Judge, Justice McLean <BOLD>[Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 1, Tab 4, paras.9, 10 and 11].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. The Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> recognized that the facts in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> were different than those in <EM>Gilbert</EM> such there was little or no risk of under-compensation due to an assignment of future statutory benefits.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at para.73.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. Many aspects of the record that satisfied this Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> apply to the facts of this case:
<P1>(a) The Appellant Barbara Lynn Carroll has been designated catastrophically impaired;</P1>
<P1>(b) The ten-year temporal limitation for SABs in <EM>Gilbert</EM> does not arise; and</P1>
<P1>(c) There were no benefits for which the assignment was requested that were not covered by SABs.</P1></P>
<P>17. In their Factum and in their oral argument, the Appellants attempted to raise an uncertainty with respect to medication under the Ontario Drug Benefit Program. The Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> conclusively rejected the identical submission made by the Appellants in this case.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Factum of the Appellants, para.59; <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra Issue</EM> 3 at paras. 19&ndash;23.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>18. The assignment granted by the Trial Judge and the assignment in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> were both conditional upon the judgment being paid in full. Pending the resolution of this Appeal, the Respondents have paid the Appellants $2,000,000. There is absolutely no risk that the Appellants will not receive full compensation. The risk is completely on the Respondents.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.78&ndash;80.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. There is no need, on the facts of this case, to reverse this Court's decision in <EM>Bannon</EM>. It is a decision that was made with respect to a different legislative framework.</P>
<P>20. Similarly, there is no need for this Court to reverse <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF>. The record before the Trial Judge in this case was very different than the record before the Trial Judge in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF>. Whether it be the &ldquo;strict&rdquo; matching required in <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> or the &ldquo;less stringent&rdquo; matching of silos applied in <EM>Basandra</EM>, the facts of this case meet either test.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2 LABEL="Part"><N>II</N><TI>CONCLUSION</TI>
<P>21. The Respondent McEwens submit that, without the benefit of this Court's decisions in <BOLD><EM>El-Khodr</EM></BOLD> and <BOLD><EM>Cobb</EM>,</BOLD> it was completely appropriate and correct in law and on the facts, for the Trial Judge to grant the Respondents the assignment.</P>
<P>22. The Respondent McEwens submit that this Court's Decision in <BOLD><EM>El-Khodr</EM></BOLD> and <BOLD><EM>Cobb</EM></BOLD> serve to reinforce their position that the assignment was the proper exercise of the Trial Judge's discretion and that the Appeal of the Trial Judge's order granting the Respondents the assignment be dismissed with costs.</P>
<P>ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this 2<SUP>nd</SUP> day of October, 2017.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY FACTUM OF THE DEFENDANTS (RESPONDENTS), Robert McEwen and Caroline McEwen, TO THE FACTUM OF THE INTERVENOR, ONTARIO TRIAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. The issue in the main appeal (Court File No. C62293), besides costs, is the trial Judge's Order that future accident benefits for health care expenses payable to Barbara Carroll (&ldquo;Ms. Carroll&rdquo;) under the Statutory Accident Benefits Regulations (&ldquo;SABs&rdquo;) be assigned to the Defendants in that action upon payment of the Judgment.</P>
<P>2. The specific issues in this case have some overlap with the issues in <CASEREF><SOC>Cadieux v. Cloutier et al</SOC><DOCKET>Court File No. C63160</DOCKET></CASEREF>. As much has already been submitted to the Court regarding the extent of matching required between a tort judgment and SABs benefits, this Reply will focus primarily upon the access to justice issue raised by the Intervenor, Ontario Trial Lawyers Association (&ldquo;OTLA&rdquo;).</P>
<P>3. It is submitted that the position advanced by OTLA will actually have the opposite effect advanced by OTLA. Trials will become more expensive and even more protracted. More detailed evidence would be required; jury questions would become more complex; trial judges' instructions to the jury would become potentially overwhelming; and jury deliberations would, in all probability, take much longer.</P>
<P>4. As this Court and other Courts have held, neither the deductibility of benefits, nor the assignment of benefits was meant to be complicated.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v.

<P>8. In support of the claim, the Plaintiffs relied upon the evidence of Carol Bierbrier, a Life Care Planner, who presented evidence with respect to a Cost of Future Care Plan or Claim that consisted of 64 line items.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Chart of Medication and Assistive Devices, Professional, Personal Care Services, Retirement Facility, Nursing Home&mdash;Tort <BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 63, pages 576 to 585].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>9. The Plaintiffs also relied upon a chart entitled &ldquo;Schedule 1 Cost of Care as per Rule 53.09&rdquo; with present value factors provided by an actuary.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><BOLD>[Revised Appeal Book and Compendium, Vol. 2, Tab 62, pages 573 to 575].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>10. If the exercise at trial is to achieve perfect matching, a jury question and a jury response for all components of the Cost of Care Schedule would be required. Common sense dictates that this would be an onerous exercise that would make trials longer and more expensive.</P>
<P>11. The Respondent McEwens submit that for the reasons set out in their Revised Factum, the &ldquo;Silos&rdquo; approach adopted by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF> and followed in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> make it clear that the level of matching required is provided in Section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>B.</N><TI><UNDER>Evidence of Past Benefits is Readily Available</UNDER></TI>
<P>12. It is submitted that, as this Court said in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, plaintiffs should not be able to avoid either the deductibility or assignment of SABs already received or to which they will be entitled in future by the manner in which the claim is presented.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at para.83 <BOLD>[Revised Respondent McEwens' Brief of Authorities, Tab 8]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>13. Typically, as occurred in this case, the health care providers involved in a plaintiff's care prior to the trial give evidence at the trial. Not only does their evidence speak to potential past claims, their evidence supports the theory of the plaintiff's case with respect to general damages, potential past and future loss of income claims, and potential past and future cost of c are claims.</P>
<P>14. In any event, there was no difficulty obtaining the particulars of the cost of past care. As in most cases, the information was requested and provided. It would have added nothing to the duration, expense or complexity of the trial if there had been a claim for past care.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>Email from Elizabeth Quigley to Kevin Nearing dated August 18, 2015, Exhibit Book, pages 1161 and 1162 <BOLD>[Respondent McEwens' Revised Compendium, Tab 5 at pages 19 and 20].</BOLD></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>15. The guidance provided by this Court in <EM>El-Khodr</EM> provides a straightforward and logical roadmap for plaintiffs in the presentation of their cases that addresses the risk of over or under compensation.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>El-Khodr</EM>, <EM>Supra</EM> at paras.84 to 86 <BOLD>[Revised Respondent McEwens' Brief of Authorities, Tab 8]</BOLD>.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. Hagerman Estate</SOC></CASEREF> required the deduction of the no-fault benefit to be from a head of damages or a type of loss <UNDER>akin</UNDER> to that for which the no-fault benefits were intended to compensate. Silos as provided for in Section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> accomplish the result intended and provided for in the legislation.</P>
<P>17. There is no access to justice issue raised by this Court's interpretation of the provisions of Section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> in the <EM>Basandra, El-Khodr</EM> and <EM>Cobb</EM> decisions of this Court.</P>

<BLOCK1><TI>REPLY FACTUM OF THE APPELLANTS, BARBARA CARROLL AND FAMILY TO THE FACTUM OF THE INTERVENOR, ONTARIO TRIAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION</TI>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I">PART I&mdash;OVERVIEW</TI>
<P>1. OTLA was permitted to intervene with respect to:
<P1>(a) the proper interpretation of deduction and assignment provisions under the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>; and</P1>
<P1>(b) the proper interpretation of s.258.3(8.1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> with respect to prejudgment interest.</P1></P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II">PART II&mdash;STATEMENT OF FACTS</TI>
<P>2. The Appellant does not rely upon any additional facts for the within reply.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III">PART III&mdash;ISSUES RAISED BY THE INTERVENOR</TI>
<BLOCK3><N>I.</N><TI>DEDUCTION AND ASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS UNDER THE <EM>INSURANCE ACT</EM></TI>
<BLOCK4><N>i.</N><TI>Generally</TI>
<P>3. OTLA made the submission that if the <EM>Cadieux</EM> decision of Hackland, J., were upheld, it would have the following effect:
<QUOTE><P>If this decision stands, for all future cases, injured plaintiffs will be required to advance all potential claims, even those claims that have been completely covered by no-fault benefits at the tort trial to prophylactically protect other heads of damages.</P></QUOTE></P>
<P>4. In practice, counsel have acted reasonably in narrowing the issues in dispute to pursue only claims that are actually sought and avoiding the pursuit of claims that have been entirely satisfied or paid by a collateral benefit provider. In our submission, such a practice should be encouraged not hindered. If the deduction and assignment provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> are interpreted to require a plaintiff to pursue <UNDER>all</UNDER> losses, even those for which they are not seeking compensation, then the reasonable practice of only pursuing claims actually sought from the defendant will be in serious jeopardy.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>ii.</N><TI>Hypothetical application of <EM>Cadieux</EM> principles to <EM>Carroll v. McEwen</EM></TI>
<P>5. The <CASEREF><SOC>Carroll v. McEwen</SOC></CASEREF> trial represents a reasonable approach to past expenses. In <EM>Carroll</EM>, the Plaintiffs only sought and received recovery for general damages and <UNDER>future</UNDER> care costs. As such, only an assignment for future benefits was sought by the Defendants (which is the subject -matter of the within Appeal). As such, the following is a discussion of the hypothetical application of the principles of <EM>Cadieux</EM> to the <CASEREF><SOC>Carroll v. McEwen</SOC></CASEREF> facts.</P>
<P>6. If the <EM>Cadieux</EM> decision was left to stand, it would have required Barbara Carroll and her family to litigate approximately <BOLD>$1.1 M</BOLD> in past expenses<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>The actual past expenses paid by the accident benefits insu rer was $1,093,063.00 representing $716,956.00 for past medical and rehabilitation expenses and $376,107 for past attendant care expenses.
<P1>See Report of Gary Princ ipe, dated December 18, 2015, Appeal Book and Compe ndium, Tab 43, p.207.</P1></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> which were incurred during the six and a half years before trial even though <UNDER>none</UNDER> of those expenses were being sought from the Defendants. It defies common sense and logic to demand that a plaintiff extend an already lengthy eight week jury trial in order to have the jury assess the reasonableness of past expenditures that the plaintif f fully recovered from collateral sources and for which the defendants are not being asked to pay.</P>
<P>7. The Reply Factum of the Respondent McEwen makes the patently false assertion that claims of past care would have &ldquo;added nothing to the duration, expense or complexity of the trial.&rdquo; Had the Plaintiffs been required to prove $1.1M in expenses previously incurred (but already compensated by collateral source), it would have been a cumbersome and exhausting process spanning over six and a half years, three different hospital and care facilities, different case managers, different treatment providers and attendant care providers. Additional <BOLD><UNDER>weeks</UNDER></BOLD> would have been added to the trial to prove these losses for which no compensation was sought. Past care claims could have been a trial unto itself.</P>
<P>8. The suggestion in the McEwen factum that evidence of Barbara Carroll's future care needs would somehow &ldquo;speak to potential past claims&rdquo; is patently false. Plaintiffs cannot rely upon assumptions in a trial&mdash;they need actual evidence for a jury to deliberate upon and ultimately award past expenditures. It would not be sufficient for a plaintiff to merely submit a print-out of past expenditures and expect a jury to rubber stamp the expenditures. It would be even more foolhardy to expect that a defendant would simply concede the past expenditures without demanding formal proof of their reasonableness. Indeed, why would they? A defendant's interest is in securing the lowest possible verdict against him/her and the highest possible credit for any payments made to the plaintiff by collateral sources.</P>
<P>9. In essence, both past and future expenditures would be expected to be vigorously challenged by the defence.</P>
<P>10. This approach was not even considered in <CASEREF><SOC>Carroll v. McEwen</SOC></CASEREF> because the practice which had been developed at trial advances the most cost effective and sensible approach to litigation. Namely, that a plaintiff should only advance the claims for which compensation is sought. Neither counsel for the Respondents in this appeal, namely Aviva nor McEwen, raised any issue with respect to this approach before, during or after trial. It is only in the appeal factums of the Respondents (before this five member panel) that these Respondents now advance the position that plaintiffs should be required to advance all potential claims regardless of whether compensation is sought from defendants or was paid by a collateral source. That was not the position advanced at trial.</P>
<P>11. Interestingly, this approach was recognized by MacFarland, J.A, in <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF> as justifying the approach towards deductions adopted in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF>. Regrettably, MacFarland, J.A., erred in concluding that this was an &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; approach when, in fact, it was and continues to be the norm. Paragraph 52 of Justice MacFarland's decision in <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF> is worth reproducing:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>[52] In Bannon, the plaintiffs did not seek recovery of benefits already provided to them by their no-fault insurer;</EM> <UNDER><EM>their claims were presented net of those benefits</EM>.</UNDER> <EM>Nevertheless, the appellants in that case argued that the payments still had to be deducted from the damage award in the tort claim. The result in Bannon is not surprising;</EM> <UNDER><EM>where the claim was presented net of no-fault payments, any further deduction would have amounted to a double counting of the no-fault benefits</EM>.</UNDER> <EM>[Emphasis Added]</EM></BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (C anLII)</CITE><PARANUM>50-52</PARANUM></CASEREF><UNDER>, Appella nts' Book of Authorities, Tab 9</UNDER></P1></P>
<P>12. Indeed, in <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF>, the Plaintiff did not advance any claims for past expenses (which had been compensated by the accident benefits insurer) and only advanced claims for future expenditures. As a result, no deduction or assignment was sought for collateral benefits for past expenses. If the <EM>Cadieux</EM> reasoning were to be applied, the Plaintiff would have been compelled to advance eight (8) years of past expenses for the sole purpose of protecting himself against a deduction of the collateral benefits against future claims.</P></BLOCK4>
<BLOCK4><N>iii.</N><TI>An &ldquo;Apples to Apples&rdquo; Interpretation Makes Sense</TI>
<P>13. In <EM>Cadieux</EM>, the Plaintiff was fully compensated for his attendant care by theaccident benefits insurer and therefore did not seek payment of these expenses from the Defendants. Forcing the Plaintiff to unreasonably advance and litigate claims for attendant care for the sole purpose of avoiding an unfair assignment is illogical. There is a clear way to determine what benefits should be assigned which would satisfy the goal of avoiding double recovery, namely the &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison developed in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF>, and which has been consistently applied for over twenty (20) years.</P>
<P>14. In order for personal injury trials to function in an expeditious and reasonable manner, an interpretation of the assignment and deduction provisions of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> that best reflects the reality of litigation is preferred. This Honourable Court should not adopt an interpretation of the legislation that would mandate the plaintiff to litigate claims that are not being pursued.</P>
<P>15. Encouraging parties to act reasonably ought to be the goal.</P>
<P>16. There is no added expense or complexity to ensuring that the jury questions mirror the benefits for which an assignment or deduction is sought. Defendants are fully aware of the benefits which plaintiffs are receiving. Defendants are fully aware of their intention to seek an assignme nt. There is nothing unfair of requiring defendants to demonstrate that the benefits for which they seek an assignment or deduction are akin to what was actually awarded by the jury. If this means longer verdict sheets, this is a small price to pay to ensure that plaintiffs are fully compensated and double recovery avoided. To do otherwise, would be to favour expediency over justice.</P>
<P>17. Section 267.8 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> should be interpreted simply as a mechanism to permit the Court to deduct collateral benefits when the Plaintiff has received compensation for the <UNDER>same loss</UNDER>. The legislation provides a listing of the type of benefits which are subject to such an assignment or deduction. The legislation is rooted in the underlying comparison of the collater al benefit to the damages received. If the plaintiff never receives damages for that loss, no deduction or assignment should be granted.</P>
<P>18. The <CASEREF><SOC>Gilbert v. South</SOC></CASEREF> and <CASEREF><SOC>Fonseca v. Hansen</SOC></CASEREF> approach make logical sense to ensure that the deductions or assignment sought actually match the damages received on an apples to apples basis. Otherwise, defendants receive a windfall at the expense of accident victims. Not only would this not advance the goal of ensuring full compensation, it fails to advance the goal of p reventing <UNDER>double</UNDER> compensation. If a plaintiff has not been compensated at all for the loss from the defendant, double compensation is a non&mdash;issue.</P></BLOCK4></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>II.</N><TI>RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF A LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT ABSENT TRANSITION LANGUAGE</TI>
<P>19. While this issue is not a live issue in the <CASEREF><SOC>Carroll v. McEwen</SOC></CASEREF> appeal, the issue is being addressed by the panel and all parties have been granted the right to respond to the Factum of the Intervenor. This party would like to make the following points with respect to this issue:
<P1>(a) section 258.3(1.1) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> is &ldquo;entirely silent&rdquo; as to whether it is to be applied retrospectively;</P1>
<P1>(b) the <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long</SOC></CASEREF> decision looked at the legislative history and concluded the previous enactments specifically provided for a temporal limitation (limiting application of interest rate provisions from the date of the enactment forward). The Court concluded that failure to include such a limitation in s.258.3(1.1) supports the view that the legislature intended the change to be retrospective;</P1>
<P1>(c) with the greatest of respect, the analysis in <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long</SOC></CASEREF> fails to consider that the previous legislation <EM>[Courts of Justice</EM> Act in 1989, in S.O. 1989, c. 67] contained provisions that were <UNDER>expressly</UNDER> retrospective in their application and some that were expressly prospective. See s. 8 (1) and (2) of the <EM>Courts of Justice Act</EM> S.O. 1989, c. 67. As such, the legislative history indicates that the Legislature gave clear and express language when retrospective application was intended. No such language is found in s. 258.3(1.1);</P1>
<P1>(d) the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</SOC></CASEREF> states that the presumption against retrospectively is worthy of protection as it &ldquo;engages the rule of law&rdquo; and &ldquo;bespeaks fairness.&rdquo; The following is an excerpt from that decision:</P1>
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>[48] T he presumption is a tool for discerning the intended temporal scope of legislation. In the absence of an indication that Parliament has considered retrospectivity and the potential for it to have unfair effects, the presumption must be that Parliament did not intend them:</EM></BOLD>
<QUOTE><P><EM>The absence of a general requirement of legislative prospectivity exists despite the fact that retrospective and retroactive legislation can overturn settled expectations and is sometimes perceived as unjust: see E. Edinger, &ldquo;Retrospectivity in Law&rdquo; (1995), 29 U.B.C. L. Rev. 5, at p. 13. Those who perceive it as such can perhaps take comfort in the rules of statutory interpretation that</EM> <UNDER><EM>require the legislature to indicate clearly any desired retroactive or retrospective effects. Such rules ensure that the legislature has turned its mind to such effects and &ldquo;determined that the benefits of retroactivity (or retrospectivity) outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness&rdquo;</EM></UNDER><BOLD>:</BOLD> <CASEREF><SOC>Landgraf v. USI Film Products</SOC><YEAR>1994</YEAR><CITE>511 U.S. 244</CITE><PARANUM>at p. 268</PARANUM></CASEREF>. <EM>[Emphasis added.]</EM></P>
<P><BOLD><EM>(Imperial Tobacco, at para. 71, per Major J.)</EM></BOLD></P></QUOTE></P>
<P><BOLD><EM>[49]</EM> <UNDER><EM>The presumption exists to ensure that laws will only apply retrospectively where Parliament has clearly signalled that it has weighed the benefits of retrospectivity with its potential unfairness. Otherwise, we presume that Parliament did not intend such effects</EM>.</UNDER> [emphasis added]</BOLD></P></QUOTE>
<P1><CASEREF><SOC>Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</SOC><CITE>[2017] 2 SCR 289</CITE><CORRELAT><CITE>2017 SCC 50 (CanLII)</CITE><PARANUM>47-49</PARANUM></CORRELAT></CASEREF>.</P1></P>
<P>(e) there are often strong policy reasons which ought to form part of the contextual analysis. The Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co.</SOC></CASEREF> explained why courts should exercise caution in implying a retrospective change pertaining to insurance:
<QUOTE><P><BOLD><EM>This case is a good illustration of the policy reasons why statutes should not be given retrospective operation in the absence of an intention to do so that is either expressed in, or is necessarily implied by the statute. Substantial rights of insurance companies are affected by the decision ... Insurance companies calculate their premiums according to known risk factors. When the rates for the contract in uestion here were calculated it was &ldquo;known&rdquo; that this particular risk&mdash;a suit in tort by Diane Angus against her husband&mdash;was precluded by s. 7. The insurance company relied upon that &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in setting its rates</EM>.</BOLD></P></QUOTE>

<P><LINE>Lawyers for the Defendants (Respondents), Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company</LINE></P>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="I"><UNDER>Overview</UNDER></TI>
<P>1. The Respondents, Aviva Canada Inc. and Pilot Insurance Company (hereinafter, &ldquo;these Respondents&rdquo;), submit the within reply factum in response to the written submissions of the intervenor, Ontario Trial Lawyers Association (hereinafter, &ldquo;OTLA&rdquo;), with respect to the manner in which the deduction and trust / assignment mechanisms set out in the <EM>Insurance Act</EM> (hereinafter, &ldquo;the <EM>Act</EM>&rdquo;) are to be handled at trial.</P>
<P>2. Specifically, these Respondents address herein OTLA's submission that strict matching of collateral benefits to damages awarded at trial ensures plaintiffs receive full compensation without double recovery, while a relaxed matching approach will impede access to justice by forcing plaintiffs to litigate losses compensated, or to be compensated, by collateral sources.</P>
<P>3. When taken to its logical conclusion, the foregoing proposition does not survive a comprehensive analysis of the <EM>Act</EM>, or a consideration of the practical realities of a personal injury trial.</P>
<P>4. Rather, to continue to apply the strict matching principles set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. McNeely</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Bannon v. Mc.Neely</SOC><CITE>1998 CanLII 4486</CITE><COURTJUR>ON CA</COURTJUR></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 1</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> would frustrate the court's ability to order a deduction or assignment generally, and would defeat the purpose of the <EM>Act</EM> to avoid double recovery. Indeed, the approach suggested by OTLA of a strict matching requirement was contemplated, and specifically rejected, by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>35</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>.</P>
<P>5. As such, these Respondents maintain that the approach set out in <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 717</CITE><PARANUM>48&ndash;55</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> and <CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 9</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> is the proper approach in the current legislative scheme, as is requiring a plaintiff to claim at trial for all damages to which a plaintiff is entitled as a result of a motor vehicle accident.</P></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="II"><UNDER>To Require Strict Matching is Contrary to the Legislative Scheme</UNDER></TI>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The <EM>Act</EM> Explicitly Rejects A Strict Matching Approach</TI>
<P>6. OTLA suggests that the <EM>Act</EM> codified the matching principles in <EM>Bannon</EM>, and therefore, s.267.8 does not change but, rather, codifies the existing law in Ontario. OTLA also notes that this Court has cited <EM>Bannon</EM> with approval on a number of occasions, even in the context of the present regime.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>OTLA's Factum, at para. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>7. Indeed, it is acknowledged that this Court has, in the recent past, cited <EM>Bannon</EM> with respect to certain non-contentious principles.</P>
<P>8. For example, in <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC></CASEREF>, this Court upheld the trial judge's approach to deduct benefits received for medical/rehabilitation, attendant care and housekeeping (approximately $146,000) from the jury award of $105,000 for past and future care, medical/rehabilitation and housekeeping, resulting in a nil award.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 251</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In so doing, <EM>Bannon</EM> was cited with respect to the statutory goal of achieving full compensation and preventing double compensation.</P>
<P>9. Nevertheless, it is clear from the outcome in <EM>Basandra</EM> that this Court differs greatly from OTLA in its interpretation of the impact of applying the principles of <EM>Bannon</EM> to the present statutory regime.</P>
<P>10. Further, it is acknowledged that the manner in which the collateral benefit interface issue was approached in <EM>Bannon</EM> likely did inform the nature of the legislative changes in 1996 (hereinafter, &ldquo;the Bill 59/198 regime&rdquo;). It is for that reason that the present statutory scheme makes completely unnecessary the strict matching requirement outlined in <EM>Bannon</EM>.</P>
<P>11. Moreover, and according to the Supreme Court of Canada in <EM>Gurniak</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>35 &amp; 44</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, no further matching of the plaintiff's damage award to the collateral benefits is required than that which is mandated by statute.</P>
<P>12. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Court considered two different matching concepts&mdash;the first being the match between the Qu&ea;bec and British Columbia benefit plans permitting a deduction. Section 25(1) of the <EM>Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.25 of the <EM>Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act</EM>, RSBC 1996, C.231, Aviva/Pilot Reply Factum, Schedule B, pg. 18</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> required the Qu&ea;bec benefit plan to be similar to the benefit plan in BC. It was the similarity between those plans that made the benefits <EM>prima facie</EM> capable of being deducted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>30&ndash;33</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Neither <EM>Bannon</EM>, nor the within appeals, deal with this first level of matching.</P>
<P>13. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the plaintiffs further argued that pursuant to <CASEREF><SOC>Jang v. Jang</SOC></CASEREF>, there is a required second level of matching, in particular, a match between the plaintiff's damage award and the benefit paid. This is the nature of the matching endorsed in <EM>Bannon</EM> and at issue in the within appeals.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>43</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>14. The Supreme Court in <EM>Gurniak</EM> specifically rejected this second level of matching. Rather, the Court held that once it is determined that the plan is the type of plan that can be deducted, the damages are to be reduced by the benefits paid pursuant to that plan, in accordance with s.25(1) of the BC <EM>Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act</EM>.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>7</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> In short, in <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Supreme Court rejected the concept of judicial matching that was urged upon them by plaintiffs' counsel.</P>
<P>15. Indeed, in British Columbia, <EM>Gurniak</EM> has been consistently cited to stand for the proposition that it is &ldquo;no longer a requirement that there be a match between the heads of damage for a tort award and specific heads of damages under the benefit recovery scheme&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>For example, most recently in <CASEREF><SOC>Dennstedt v. Lepine</SOC><CITE>2018 BCSC 220</CITE><PARANUM>82</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Book of Authorities Re: Response to OTLA, Tab 3 and also in <CASEREF><SOC>Sovani v. Jin</SOC><CITE>2005 BCSC 1285</CITE><PARANUM>66&ndash;76</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Book of Authorities Re: Response to OTLA, Tab 1 and <CASEREF><SOC>Manitoba Public Insurance v. Dybhaun</SOC><CITE>2016 BCSC 27</CITE><PARANUM>46-47</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Book of Authorities Re: Response to OTLA, Tab 2.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>16. In Ontario, a plain reading of the <EM>Act</EM> in its current form commands a similar result.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>A Strict Matching Approach Will Facilitate Double Recovery</TI>
<P>17. Contrary to OTLA's submission, a strict matching approach will not ensure plaintiffs receive full compensation <BOLD>without double recovery</BOLD>. Rather, the extent of the strict matching OTLA suggests in theory would be very difficult to achieve in practice, and, as such, overcompensation would become the norm rather than the exception.</P>
<P>18. As stated in <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, this Court should not be prevented from making the appropriate deduction or assignment because of the manner in which the claim for special damages is presented to the jury.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>El-Khodr v. Lackie</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 716 (CanLII)</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 9 at paras. 83&ndash;86</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>19. This outcome could ensue, for example, if certain time periods or certain losses are not presented to the jury, or where claims covered by accident benefits are lumped together with those which are not. Either approach would arguably make strict qualitative and temporal matching nearly impossible.</P>
<P>20. For example, consider the case of a plaintiff who was a high school student working at the time of the accident and who received income replacement benefits from a collateral carrier post-accident. That plaintiff could present the jury with a theory that but for the accident, s/he would have continued to university and then entered a workforce where s/he could have earned more money. That way, the plaintiff's income loss claim would necessarily start later on a higher annual loss basis.</P>
<P>21. As such, the time period of the loss being advanced would not match the time period of the collateral benefit. Requiring strict temporal matching would infuse significant uncertainty as to whether the income replacement benefits received by that plaintiff should be deducted in this circumstance.</P>
<P>22. Moreover, in terms of income loss, the SABS scheme bases entitlement and quantum on the preloss period (whether the plaintiff was working prior to the accident and the amount he or she was earning), while the tort scheme bases entitlement and quantum on the post-accident period using the &ldquo;but-for&rdquo; or &ldquo;real and substantial possibility&rdquo; tests. This key difference in compensation schemes (one looking back&mdash;SABS; one looking forward&mdash;tort) makes the level of strict temporal matching called for by OTLA more unlikely to be achieved in many cases. Double recovery would inevitably become much more commonplace.</P>
<P>23. The foregoing example highlights the inherent difficulties in reconciling two different systems of compensation, tort and SABS, for automobile-related personal injuries, and the inherent difficulties in requiring a strict level of matching as between them.</P>
<P>24. It is submitted that the issues associated with reconciling these two different schemes of compensation for injured plaintiffs was considered by the Legislature and answered by the broad matching &ldquo;silos&rdquo; set out in statute (income loss; health care; and other pecuniary losses). No further sub-division, either temporal or qualitative, is required or desirable.</P>
<P>25. Moreover, any residual concern regarding the matching of the jury award to a collateral benefit, particularly with respect to future collateral benefits, does not survive a hard look.</P>
<P>26. As an example, if the jury award for future care costs of $700,000 includes an item not covered by SABs (for example, government funded medication) and yet an assignment is granted for the full $700,000 which includes that amount, the net effect will simply be that if the plaintiff incurs the cost of medication post-trial and then submits it to the SABs carrier, that amount will simply not be reimbursed because the SABs carrier is not the first loss payor. The plaintiff will have already been compensated for that amount by the jury award. The tortfeasor will not recover that amount pursuant to the assignment or otherwise.</P>
<P>27. Through the assignment mechanism, the risk of future non-payment by the collateral carrier is borne by the tortfeasor, and not the plaintiff.</P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>
<BLOCK2><TI TOCID="III"><UNDER>The Damages Subject to Deduction Must Be All Damages (Per Silo) To Which A Plaintiff Is Entitled</UNDER></TI>
<P>28. OTLA suggests that a plaintiff should be permitted to advance only net losses at trial, and that the deductions (if any) must match only the claims pursued.</P>
<P>29. This position is not sustainable in light of the plain language of the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>30. The <EM>Act</EM> mandates that the damages which are subject to deduction are the global damages for past and future losses and are to be reduced by all benefits received or available (per silo).</P>
<P>31. For example, s.267.8(4) of the <EM>Act</EM> expressly requires that the health care damages to which a plaintiff is entitled for expenses that have been incurred (past), or will be incurred (future), are to be reduced by the SABS received or available for health care.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.8(1), (4) &amp; (6) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> The global (past and future) damages are reduced by the SABS received or available (per silo).</P>
<P>32. Thereafter, if the deduction would more than offset the past losses, it will, by necessity, offset some measure of the future losses.</P>
<P>33. Section 267.8(1) of the <EM>Act</EM>, dealing with damages to which a plaintiff is entitled for income loss and loss of earning capacity, has been similarly interpreted by this Court on a number of occasions.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cummings (Litigation Guardian of) v. Douglas</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 615</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 4; <CASEREF><SOC>Basandra v. Sforza</SOC><CITE>2016 ONCA 251</CITE></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 8; <CASEREF><SOC>Cobb v. Long Estate</SOC><CITE>2017 ONCA 717</CITE><PARANUM>48&ndash;55</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 7</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> This Court has consistently held that the deductions are to be made from the global damage award (past and future).</P>
<P>34. There is no qualifying language in the <EM>Act</EM> which requires that the damages subject to deduction to be only the damages pursued by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>35. To the contrary, s.267.8 (1), (4) and (6) of the <EM>Act</EM> stipulate that &ldquo;the damages to which a plaintiff is entitled...shall be reduced by...all payments in respect of the incident&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.8(1), (4) &amp; (6) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> Accordingly, the <EM>Act</EM> does not state that the damages pursued by the plaintiff are the net damages, but rather, the damages to which a plaintiff is &ldquo;entitled&rdquo;.</P>
<P>36. Under the OMPP / <EM>Bannon</EM> regime, the nature of the damages against which the deductions were to be made was worded differently.</P>
<P>37. In <EM>Bannon</EM>, s.267.1 of the <EM>Act</EM> read &ldquo;the damages awarded to a person shall be reduced by...&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.1 of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 13</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>38. The now operative s.267.8 refers to &ldquo;the damages to which a plaintiff is entitled&rdquo;, not to &ldquo;the damages awarded&rdquo;.</P>
<P>39. In <CASEREF><SOC>Madill v Chu</SOC></CASEREF>, &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; was given its ordinary meaning where the nature of a collateral benefit entitlement was in issue.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Madill v. Chu</SOC><CITE>[1977] 2 SCC 400</CITE><PAGENUM>at pgs. 409-410</PAGENUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE> It was not interpreted to mean pursued by the plaintiff and accepted, and hence, payable. In <EM>Madill</EM>, the plaintiff chose not to apply for collateral benefits to which he was otherwise &ldquo;entitled&rdquo;, and the Supreme Court held they should be deducted nevertheless.</P>
<P>40. The use of the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; in s.267.8 of the current regime should be similarly interpreted to mean entitlement, at law, to all damages arising from the accident, and not just the specific damages sought by a plaintiff and awarded by a jury.</P>
<BLOCK3><N>i.</N><TI>The Supreme Court Has Considered and Rejected the &ldquo;Net Claims&rdquo; Approach</TI>
<P>41. The Supreme Court of Canada considered the very issue of a plaintiff presenting only &ldquo;net claims&rdquo; in <EM>Gurniak</EM> and rejected it, instead endorsing an approach consistent with this Court's decisions in <EM>Cobb</EM> and <EM>El-Khodr</EM>.</P>
<P>42. At paragraph 37, the Supreme Court quotes <CASEREF><SOC>Jang v. Jang</SOC></CASEREF> where the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated &ldquo;I do not think that the claim there referred to is the whole claim rather it is a claim to a particular heading of loss matched by a particular heading of benefits.&rdquo;</P>
<P>43. The Supreme Court went on to overrule <EM>Jang</EM> and therefore rejected that very sentiment. The claim to be advanced by a plaintiff is the whole claim, and not just some chosen portion of the claim, against which the like benefits may then be deducted.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>44. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Court appreciated that with the rejection of judicial matching, there may be some unfairness, in rare cases, where the object of preventing double recovery would not be realized. The Court found that this potential unfairness could be overcome by a plaintiff advancing all claims. Any residual unfairness should be dealt with by legislative reform.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>45. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Supreme Court recognized that if a plaintiff only advances part of his or her loss (punitive damages), s/he risks having the award for punitive damages reduced by a completely unrelated compensatory loss benefit. There would be no matching: a non-compensatory damage award (punitive) reduced by a compensatory loss benefit (<EM>i.e.</EM>: income- replacement benefits). The Court indicated the answer is for plaintiffs to advance all of their losses (compensatory and non-compensatory) so that when all benefits received as a result of the accident are deducted, there is no unfairness visited upon the plaintiff.</P>
<P>46. In any event, the Court stated that this will typically be more of a theoretical concern than a real one, as follows:
<QUOTE><P>Parties will, as a matter of course, advance tort claims for the <UNDER>full</UNDER> extent of the benefits to which they believe they are legally entitled (i.e., full compensatory and punitive damages). <BOLD>It would be an anomalous case indeed where the tort award consisted solely of heads of damage that did not have some type of a counterpart in the benefits determined to be similar under s. 25(1).</BOLD> To the limited extent that this may occur, this problem is more appropriately addressed through legislative reform. Importing a &ldquo;matching&rdquo; requirement into s. 25(2), beyond the matching required in the analysis of similarity, would risk undermining the legislature's intent to prevent double recovery in a manner that is simple, expedient and, on the whole, effective. [Emphasis added]<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><EM>Ibid</EM></P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>47. In other words, the Supreme Court anticipated that a plaintiff, in the above example, would seek both compensatory damages and punitive damages, thereby permitting a deduction against the compensatory damages, leaving only the punitive damages as the net award.</P>
<P>48. In short, the expectation of the Supreme Court of Canada is that a plaintiff should advance at trial a claim for all damages to which a plaintiff is entitled as a result of a motor vehicle accident.</P>
<P>49. Indeed, this approach has been identified by the British Columbia Court of Appeal as the &ldquo;preferable&rdquo; approach in the right circumstances.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gasior v. Bayes</SOC><CITE>2010 BCCA 285</CITE><PARANUM>17</PARANUM></CASEREF>, OTLA Book of Authorities, Tab 8</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>50. The approach endorsed by the majority view in <EM>Gurniak</EM> is necessary to achieve the objectives of the <EM>Act</EM> in Ontario, which is that a plaintiff should advance at trial all damages to which a plaintiff is entitled, and from that, the court can deduct / assign all of the benefits received or to be received (matched only by the legislated &ldquo;<EM>silos</EM>&rdquo;) as a result of the accident.</P>
<P>51. <EM>Gurniak</EM> advises that to avoid any potential unfairness associated with a collateral benefit interface scheme without judicial matching, plaintiffs should advance a claim for the full extent of their losses flowing from an accident.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>52. In Ontario, there has arguably been some ambiguity and inconsistency in that regard, such that a plaintiff who failed to properly advance all losses may be met with an unexpected deduction. However, going forward, if this Court accepts the submissions of these Respondents (and maintains the approach articulated in <EM>Cobb</EM> and <EM>El-Khodr</EM>), future litigants will understand the manner in which the issue is to be handled.</P>
<P>53. As such, plaintiffs will understand that it is not appropriate to advance only net claims, or only those losses for which they wish to seek compensation. Plaintiffs should, and presumably will, advance at trial a claim for all damages to which a plaintiff believes they are legally entitled as losses flowing from the accident.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>ii.</N><TI>OTLA's Approach Would Undermine the Order of Operations Dictated by Statute</TI>
<P>56. OTLA's approach to permit a plaintiff to unilaterally decide to advance &ldquo;net claims&rdquo; would render meaningless the split and deduct order of operations mechanism in s.267.8(8) of the <EM>Act</EM>. This would be inherently unfair to defendants when there is a liability split.</P>
<P>5 7. The order of operations with respect to a liability split and the deduction of collateral benefits was determined by this Court in <CASEREF><SOC>Cummings v. Douglas</SOC></CASEREF><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Cummings (Litigation Guardian of) v. Douglas</SOC><CITE>2007 ONCA 615</CITE><PARANUM>10</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 4</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, and codified in Bill 59. Both the common law and s.267.8(8) of the <EM>Act</EM> stipulate that collateral benefits received or available are deducted <BOLD>after the split in liability</BOLD>:
<QUOTE><P>The reductions required by subsection (1) (4) and (6) shall be made after any apportionment of damages required by section 3 of the Negligence Act.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.8(1), (4) &amp; (6) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 16</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></QUOTE></P>
<P>58. As an example, consider a case where a plaintiff has a total past loss of income of $400,000 and received $100,000 in income replacement benefits prior to trial. If the plaintiff presents and proves a past income loss claim of $300,000 (without claiming for the time period already compensated for by his or her collateral carrier in the amount of $100,000) and is found 75% contributorily negligent, his or her tort award would be $75,000 ($300,000 x .25).</P>
<P>59. However, if the plaintiff properly advanced his or her full past income loss claim of $400,000 and was found 75% contributorily negligent, his or her tort award would be $100,000 minus the $100,000 received in income replacement benefits, for a net award of nil.</P>
<P>60. OTLA's approach of presenting net claims is inconsistent with the order of operations required by the <EM>Act</EM>. If net claims are presented, then collateral benefits are, by definition, deducted by counsel prior to the trial. As a result, any split in liability as determined by the court will take place <EM>after</EM> the deduction of collateral benefits. The effect is to reverse the order of operations mandated by the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>61. As demonstrated above, the impact of the proper order of operations (split, then deduct) can be significant. Indeed, it could well determine success, or not, at trial, as well a party's entitlement to costs.</P>
<P>62. The need to give effect to the intention of the legislature supports the approach urged by these Respondents, and indeed the approach most consistent with <EM>Gurniak, Cobb</EM> and <EM>El-Khodr</EM>.</P>
<P>63. That is, a plaintiff should advance at trial all damages to which a plaintiff is entitled, so that the trial judge can deduct / assign any collateral benefits received or to be received within the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; mandated by the <EM>Act</EM>.</P>
<P>64. Ultimately, this approach preserves the integrity of the <EM>Act</EM> and avoids any potential mischief, of the kind posited by the Supreme Court in <EM>Madill</EM><FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>In <EM>Madill</EM>, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the consequences of the relevant section could not be avoided by simply not pursuing the benefit&mdash;<CASEREF><SOC>Madill v. Chu</SOC><CITE>[1977] 2 SCC 400</CITE><PAGENUM>at pgs. 409-410</PAGENUM></CASEREF>, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Supplementary Book of Authorities, Tab 8. It is noteworthy that in <EM>Carroll</EM>, the plaintiffs did, in fact, avoid the consequences of the s.267.8(8) split and deduct provision in the <EM>Act</EM> given the liability split found by the jury. The resulting impact was not insignificant.</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE>, which would undermine the object of the legislation.</P></BLOCK3>
<BLOCK3><N>iii.</N><TI>Trials Will Not Be Unnecessarily Lengthened</TI>
<P>68. OTLA submits that requiring plaintiffs to prove compensated losses will result in trial inefficiency and will impact access to justice. There appears to be no evidentiary support provided for this assertion.</P>
<P>69. The &ldquo;access to justice&rdquo; issue appears to be predicated on the notion that the approach OTLA recommends would be more efficient. This is not borne out when the broader and practical realities of a personal injury trial are considered.</P>
<P>70. As an example, at the tort trial, the <EM>Carroll</EM> Plaintiffs sought to recover only non-pecuniary general damages and damages for future costs of care. In the presentation of those claims, the Plaintiffs went through the process of establishing the pattern of consumption as it related to past losses, as part of proving and demonstrating their future loss. This approach is not atypical.</P>
<P>71. Most plaintiffs address thoroughly at trial their past healthcare treatment, whether they are seeking recovery for those expenses or not. As such, there is arguably minimal incremental cost, time or complexity in requiring plaintiffs to sue for all their losses (per category).</P>
<P>72. In any event, there are many ways to streamline the trial process in this regard in a cooperative fashion, once established. This might include counsel simply agreeing to a chart or schedule that sets out the expenses incurred to the date of trial.</P>
<P>73. Further, and in particular, OTLA's suggestion that litigants should be encouraged to only advance claims net of <EM>future</EM> collateral benefits is impractical.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>OTLA's Factum, para. 37</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>74. For example, if the <EM>Carroll</EM> Plaintiffs were to have presented their case as OTLA suggests, the trial would likely have been with respect to non-pecuniary general damages only. This would be a rare case indeed, and would almost certainly give rise to disputes as to which benefits will be available in the future. These are the very disputes which existed in the OMPP regime.</P>
<P>75. Therefore, OTLA's approach infuses a level of impracticality and uncertainty into the process. Rather than shortening trials, there could be lengthy and ongoing disputes about whether there is, or is not, a future collateral benefit &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo;. That is exactly the problem that the assignment mechanism in s.267.8(12) of the <EM>Act</EM> was meant to overcome.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P>s.267.8(12) of the <EM>Insurance Act</EM>, 1990, c. I.8, Aviva/Pilot Supplementary Responding Factum, Schedule B, pg. 17</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P>
<P>76. Moreover, the strict matching approach espoused by OTLA would necessitate much longer and more detailed jury questions, and otherwise add to the length and complexity of the trial process.</P>
<P>77. In <EM>Gurniak</EM>, the Supreme Court has already held that importing a judicial matching requirement would risk making at least certain aspects of the trial more complex, less expedient and, on the whole, less effective. Conversely, the approach mandated by <EM>Gurniak</EM> (no greater matching than that required by statute), and urged by these Respondents, &ldquo;has the benefit of simplicity and ease of application&rdquo;.<FOOTNOTE><FREEFORM><P><CASEREF><SOC>Gurniak v. Nordquist</SOC><CITE>2003 SCC 59</CITE><PARANUM>46</PARANUM></CASEREF>, Appellants' Book of Authorities, Tab 11</P></FREEFORM></FOOTNOTE></P></BLOCK3></BLOCK2>

<P>78. These Respondents submit that no more than the broad matching categories or &ldquo;silos&rdquo; in the <EM>Act</EM> is required for the deduction or assignment of collateral benefits.</P>
<P>79. Further, the intention of the legislature (for example, s.267.8(8)&mdash;split and deduct) should not be frustrated by simply presenting the tort claim net of collateral benefits.</P>
<P>80. The approach urged by these Respondents, which is consistent with the legislation, the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada <EM>in Gurniak</EM>, and this Court in <EM>Cobb</EM> and <EM>El-Khodr</EM>, ensures a fair and balanced application of the tort and collateral benefits interface scheme.</P>
<P>81. A plaintiff should advance at trial all damages to which a plaintiff is entitled, so that the trial judge can deduct / assign the collateral benefits within the &ldquo;silos&rdquo; mandated by the <EM>Act</EM>. No strict temporal or qualitative matching is required by statute, nor is it necessary or desirable. Indeed, as per <EM>Gurniak</EM>, it is expected that plaintiffs will advance all claims in any event. Indeed, the Supreme Court acknowledged that it would be a rare case where a plaintiff would not do so.</P>
<P>82. If this Court accepts the submissions of these Respondents, plaintiffs will on a going forward basis understand that they should advance at trial all damages to which the plaintiff is entitled as losses flowing from a motor vehicle accident. This approach should serve to eliminate any unexpected deductions and hence, any potential unfairness.</P>
<P>83. There is no evidence before this Court that this approach will actually serve to lengthen trials in any material fashion. The practical realities of a personal injury trial, and the implications of the disputes which would arise from OTLA's proposed approach, defeat the access to justice arguments presented.</P>
